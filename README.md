# GUAva
GUAva is a YouTube speech corpus (currently under development) based on the Growing Up Asian American (GUA) video tag. It will be used to study language variation in Asian North American individuals.

The GUAva corpus is created and processed via the [LingTube](https://github.com/Narquelion/LingTube) suite of tools for linguistic analysis of YouTube data. It is being developed alongside LingTube and the [YouSpeak](https://github.com/Narquelion/LingTube/tree/main/youspeak) pipeline, a branch of LingTube specifically for doing phonetic speech research on YouTube-sourced audio. This repo therefore also serves as an example of how one could use the LingTube/YouSpeak tools.
