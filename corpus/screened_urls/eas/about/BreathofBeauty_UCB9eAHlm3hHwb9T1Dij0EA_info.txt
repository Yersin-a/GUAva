# Description

I'm a Korean-Japanese American, dog-loving engineer with a passion for makeup!
I believe in the POWER of beauty, inward & outward. I believe we can see beauty in everything and everyone. All we have to do...is take a deep breath... of beauty. 
God has made each and every one of us to be beautiful and perfect in His eyes. I want my content to echo that TRUTH.

Let's discover the beauty around us AND WITHIN ourselves together :)
