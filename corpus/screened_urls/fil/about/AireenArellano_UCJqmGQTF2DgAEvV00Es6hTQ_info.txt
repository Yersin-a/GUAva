Aireen Arellano

# Description

My name is Aireen Arellano, and I am an art director/graphic designer and illustrator. My design services company is Aerial Ardour, LLC, and my work has been featured in AdAge.com, Adweek.com, Forbes.com, and Refinery29. I started this channel to share art, design, and small business tips. I might also give you a peek at my snorty co-workers (Ariel the Frenchie and Dr. Emmett Brown the Boston Terrier) and maybe other lifestyle stuff if that’s what you’re into.
