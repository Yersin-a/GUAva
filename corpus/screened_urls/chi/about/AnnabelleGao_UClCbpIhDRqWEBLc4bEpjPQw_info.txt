# Description

hellO! im Annabelle, some of you know me as pyper from Pyperbleu (my small business + artist pseudomym)

my youtube journey began as a hobby in highschool, then really found a community through documenting my life through art school studying textiles at RISD. I recently renamed my channel from CatCreature to my full name as a new chapter moving forward.
now i am trying to make it on my own as an online creator, multi-media artist, mini business owner, and stuff (?) 
i like to talk about artful living, often attempt to integrate sustainable practices into my everyday, and share the precious moments of life with you. 
all kinds of fun and random bits & bobs on this channel as i try new things, attempt to adult and see the world!- stick around, and spread the love :-D
