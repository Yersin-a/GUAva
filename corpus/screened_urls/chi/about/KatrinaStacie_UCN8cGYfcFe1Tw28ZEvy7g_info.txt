# Description

LA native and educator looking to spread joy while practicing intentionality and authenticity. Not a guru of any kind—just documenting and doing what makes me happy. Hoping to continue to chase my many dreams (no matter how big) and to never stop being my number one fan. Thank you for stopping by my little corner of the internet. ♡

Dec 2016:

Hi, I'm Katrina!

I used to always hopelessly dream that one day I'd be famous so I could take cool pictures, make videos, and do all the fun, cool stuff that famous people do, but I realized... why do I need to be famous to do the things I enjoy? LOL Why not just do it now?! Why not make my own dreams come true?

So here I am.. making videos of me being me because that's what makes me happy, and hopefully they can make you happy too! Project ALIFWIN* is underway! (*Acting Like I'm Famous When I'm Not)

Thank you for your support ♡ You really don't know how much it means to me.
