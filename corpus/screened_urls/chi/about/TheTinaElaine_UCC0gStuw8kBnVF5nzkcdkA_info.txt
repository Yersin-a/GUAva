# Description

Hi, I'm Tina.

I make videos because I want to make people smile :) 
One could say that this channel is my personal journal where I share my life: vlogs, covers, makeup tutorials to kpop reaction videos (mostly BTS), all of which are supporting my goal to spreading more kindness in this world. 
My goal for this channel is to spread positivity while sharing my voice to the world. I'd love for you to join me as I discover what experiences come my way and document my growth and accomplishments. 
Remember you are precious, you are worth it and you are loved, especially by me! 
Welcome to my life: The Tina Elaine
