195.28	198.959	myself and my time i committed my time
198.959	200.4	to school

207.36	208.799	i'm going to give you guys a couple of
208.799	209.36	tips
209.36	212.159	for those of you that need it to help

216.08	217.36	have for you is
217.36	220.959	just to prioritize school um
220.959	223.12	i know that it's really hard to say no
223.12	224.64	to hanging out with your friends and
224.64	227.04	family i've had to say no
227.04	229.2	over the past two years i've had to say
229.2	230.799	no to hanging out with friends
230.799	232.879	to going to family events but i know
232.879	233.84	it's worth it
233.84	236.319	when you have that goal when you have a
236.319	237.519	goal in mind
237.519	239.68	stick to it be disciplined if it's
239.68	240.72	something that you really
240.72	243.599	want i know that sacrificing time with
243.599	245.12	friends and family and all those
245.12	248.64	important events um you know sometimes
248.64	250.08	you have to sacrifice
250.08	252.64	time to get the results that you want
252.64	253.68	the second tip
253.68	255.599	that i have for anyone that is
255.599	257.28	struggling in college
257.28	260.639	is to be extremely organized i noticed
260.639	263.28	that once i started writing everything
263.28	264.639	down in my planner
264.639	266.72	even reading assignments stuff that i
266.72	268.0	didn't have to turn in
268.0	269.68	stuff that i had to do for the day for
269.68	272.16	the week write everything down just so
272.16	274.639	you know exactly what you need to do
274.639	277.52	when it's due deadlines that you want to
277.52	278.639	give yourself
278.639	280.56	for reading assignments and write
280.56	283.199	everything down it will make everything
283.199	286.72	so much easier and seamless in college
286.72	288.32	so the third tip that i have for you
288.32	289.919	guys is sit
289.919	292.24	in the front in the classes that you
292.24	294.8	think you're struggling in i
294.8	297.44	took business calculus twice and i
297.44	299.52	didn't do well both times
299.52	302.479	i'm so sorry about the noise the third
302.479	302.96	time
302.96	305.12	i sat in the front i made sure i paid
305.12	307.199	attention came early to class
307.199	310.56	asked questions whenever i was confused
310.56	313.36	um that's another thing sit in the front
313.36	315.44	and don't be shy to ask questions
315.44	318.16	so that really helped me in my class i
318.16	319.36	have a very
319.36	321.199	short attention span so if i'm not
321.199	322.4	sitting in the front
322.4	324.88	i will go on my phone i will doodle on
324.88	325.84	my notebook
325.84	327.919	i know that it's really tempting to just
327.919	328.88	sit in the back
328.88	331.12	and chill on your phone but if you
331.12	332.24	really want to
332.24	335.28	excel in a class and stay focused i
335.28	337.039	advise you to
337.039	338.96	sit in the front and don't be afraid to
338.96	340.32	ask questions
340.32	343.039	when you're lost so the last and final
343.039	345.84	tip is to ask your professor questions
345.84	347.68	when you are struggling in the class
347.68	350.72	take time to go to their office hours
350.72	353.44	because most likely they're willing to
353.44	354.0	help you
354.0	356.56	willing to give you extra credit um i
356.56	358.0	know that when i was struggling
358.0	359.84	in the class i had constant
359.84	362.0	communication with my professor
362.0	365.52	and they remember that when they are
365.52	367.6	either going to bump your grade up or
367.6	370.0	not you want to have good communication
370.0	371.919	with your professors and build that good
371.919	373.919	relationship with them because
373.919	375.84	it will pay off in the end i just want
375.84	377.199	to thank you guys so much
377.199	379.52	for the positive response that i
379.52	381.52	received on my last video
381.52	384.24	and i wish you guys the best of luck if
