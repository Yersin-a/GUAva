hello everyone welcome back to my channel so today I wanted to do a get ready with me plus answering the growing up Asian American tag so I'll just be getting ready and answering each question the first question is which ethnicity are you and I am Tony's American the second question is which generation are you and my sister and I were born here and my parents came from Taiwan so I think that makes us first-generation also I'm going to start getting ready so I'm gonna put all of the products that I'm using down in the description below third question is what is the first experience where you felt that demarcation of being a minority and/or different so the first time I felt that was definitely and I think third or fourth grade I was at lunch and my mom had packed me basically like rice with like veggies like different side dishes that I could eat with my rice and I remember everyone else was eating like a sandwich that their parents packed or they bought lunch so like pizza chicken tenders that sort of thing and I remember thinking like being really excited for my lunch first off because I love like Asian food and basically I opened my lunch up and then everyone was like oh what is that smell like what what are you eating and I definitely felt very obviously judged for what I was eating and it made me feel really bad and the way people were talking about my food and just kind of judging what I was eating made me feel like oh I don't really want to eat this anymore I want to just eat whatever anyone else is eating even though I would have been happier eating what my mom packed but for all the questions and comments that I was getting I basically going forward I just always bought lunch like had pizza and chicken fingers and hamburgers at school and it's sad because I was much happier eating my lunch that my mom packed but because of what everyone was saying I decided that I wanted to buy lunch the fourth question is were you always proud of your heritage or was there a time you rejected it there was definitely a time I rejected it and I would say it was definitely at those like late elementary school years all the way up to like high school maybe and it was tough because I knew I already physically looked different and I didn't want people to just point it out or notice that even more whether that be through the food I was eating the stuff I was wearing the things I was saying and that's why I hated when people asked me like where are you from because that was so just an obvious question that made people sure that I was different but I remember when I was young when people asked me like where are your parents from I would always say Taiwan and then no one knew where Taiwan was at that time this was probably like early elementary school nobody knew and people would say oh Thailand and I would say oh no Taiwan and then no one would know where that was so then I would just end up saying oh my parents are from China so I said that for quite a few years actually and then later on when I went to university that's when I started saying Taiwan again and people actually started knowing where Taiwan was which was quite impressive and I think Taiwan over the past ten fifteen twenty years has definitely up their tourism so that has definitely helped it gain some more traction and more people are just a little bit familiar with the country this question is what are some stereotypes that you struggle with the very obvious one is that as an you're smart and you're expected to get good grades and even though that is true like our parents do expect us to get good grades I think it gave me a lot of pressure knowing that I had to be smart I should have done better in class I should have gotten a better score and it also didn't help that people automatically look at you and think oh you're Asians are smart so you're a nod so you're not cool and it made me kind of wish that I wasn't smart I wish that like I didn't have that stereotype and people didn't think of me that way so I remember when I was younger I would always pretend that I didn't do as well in class or I wouldn't be as interested in academics as I actually was just to appear cool and to fit in but now I'm super proud to be known as smart I think that's a great thing and I think especially when you're working and people have this smart impression of you that's so beneficial I want to continue growing my intelligence growing my smarts and really building my knowledge because knowledge is priceless this question is can you speak your language and yes if you pay attention to my YouTube you know that I do speak Chinese and I've been creating some Chinese videos on here but my Chinese is definitely not good as far as Taiwanese I can understand Taiwanese and I can speak a little bit but it just sounds really funky eat seven how has being asian-american affected your relationship with your parents so it's definitely affected my relationship with my parents I remember when I was younger I hated everything that they put me through from extracurriculars like learning to draw going to take piano and just a ton of extracurriculars I remember I hated it and I was like why can't I just go home and do my homework and rest and then on Saturdays we have Chinese school and that was even worse because like all my friends only had to go to school five days a week and I had to go to school six days a week and learn another language that I didn't necessarily want to be learning so it definitely created a lot of tension and I remember fighting along with my parents but I'm so grateful that they put me through all these extracurriculars and all these Chinese classes and lessons because I'm so happy I can speak the language at least somewhat fluently and I'm so happy that I don't know that I through doing all those extra extracurriculars I was able to build my own skill sets and really understand what hard work is and understand just like understand more of hobbies cultures and what's out there the eighth question is how do you feel about your heritage now do you identify with it and yes I'm so proud to be Tony's American I definitely identify with it I love everything about Taiwan I love Tony's people whenever whenever I see anyone who just came from Taiwan and they introduce themselves and obviously they're here in a different country I try to really make an effort to let them know hey like I'm Tony's - I'm Tony's American I grew up here but I can speak the language I understand Taiwan and I want them to feel like they can come fight and ask me anything and that I'm here for them because we're all Taiwanese last question is what is your favorite thing about being Asian Americans last year heritage so Taiwanese American favorite thing about being Tony's American is definitely being able to see and understand both world so the American and also the Tony's Asian so that's a perspective that I feel like you definitely don't get to have unless you're both and I feel like getting to understand both cultures both environments both types of people and just really seeing the complexity of each culture and the difference and variety in those cultures is very astounding where's my Asian American tag thank you so much for getting ready with me and I hope this gave you some
