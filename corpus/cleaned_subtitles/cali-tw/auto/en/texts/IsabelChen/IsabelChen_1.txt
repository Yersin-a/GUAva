hary one it's me Isabel it's been such a long time my stomach just growled it's been a really long time since I filmed I'm so sorry it was my first year of college finished and now I am back home in Taiwan I just wanted to film this video because a few days ago or yesterday I was watching Jenna's video of being korean-american and this was a tag from Amy her friend who was doing this in terms of Asians Pacific American Heritage Month and I was watching some videos on BuzzFeed which they also had other people talking about their experiences being immigrants or also like born in America but having to face like some difficulties and also successes being Asian so I thought I would share some of my stories I am really passionate about it overall basically what Amy did was she put a whole tag a few questions I just did her questions that she provided and just answered them back on my trusty dusty laptop that further ado we'll just start with it um new look hello I hope you guys enjoy so I'm Taiwanese American and I am a second generation immigrant my parents they left Taiwan to go to America and they met and they fell in love and I was born on July 22nd in San Diego and that's how I came to be like we were in San Diego and then we moved to Irvine and then we moved to San Jose I would have Chinese school and I would also have temple and these were things that were usually happening during my weekends and it was just kind of weird to connect with other people and realize that they didn't have Chinese school or they didn't have temple to go to during the weekend that was when I kind of felt like I was different but I just didn't really know why I was just like oh maybe that's just my family likes to do this never really had that much thought about it what really made me realize how different I was is when my family moved to Taiwan because of my dad's job during that time I was placed into an International School in Taiwan I VSH I just started to notice the difference of like Oh being Asian our school was literally like a whole grade was like 57 people and literally all of them were Asian there were only probably a few that were not even in that huge group of people that I that were like the same ethnicity as me I felt different I realized like my experience in Taiwan would be so different from my friends back in America like their high school experiences or like all the movies that I would watch of like prom we did have prom but it's like these experiences were not going to be at like the same as it would be if I was back in America and that's when I started to realize the difference of it or like international school it's where academia is largely English based but you will also have Chinese class you also have Chinese social studies which that adds on to an extra two hours so when usually back in America I would end class at 247 i'd end class here at 410 so that was always something where - I dressed with and also like the culture was not entirely similar to being in America and like having the education there when I was back in America I would be like super excited of being um going to Taiwan because I was like this is the place where I love how crowded it I was always really happy to go to Taiwan I would find my family like my relatives and my grandma she cooked amazing food there was only once I went to back to Taiwan I actually lived there like lived here permanently for like eight years um that's when I started to really like reject my culture cuz I felt like everything was so homogenized and there was a really much diversity not saying all Asians are the same someone says that like but in terms of like our background was pretty much similar in my high school it was incredibly competitive there would be days where I felt like I was living in a bubble because everyone was kind of striving for the same things that it just started to become really like pressuring over all I really wanted to meet people that were different from me like they had different stories they had a different background as opposed to something so similar because I felt like that really just made me focus on like a really narrow mindset as opposed to have like a wider mindset I only started to really like appreciate it was when I came back from my first year know first semester from college I go to college in New York so New York and Taiwan is literally like halfway across the globe it's just so far away there is still like some parts of Taiwanese culture but it's pretty miniscule compared to coming back here really just allowed me to miss home and realize like there are some experiences that I have that no one is able to really comprehend and really truly understand I felt so grateful to have I felt so grateful to be called the international student because it really allowed me to gain this like critical view point the way of how I saw my life back in Taiwan and my life during college okay so some stereotypes that I managed to struggle with Asian they're smart Asians are good at math there's so many others that I could keep on talking about but that would just take a really long time for this pressure like that was not really spoken but you could still feel Asians should be doing something that's more practical something more science or like stem based I was never really the person who was good at that I would always struggle on the subjects that we were expected agents were expected to be good at wanting to do performing arts that just really made me different a lot of people would really judge comments of like oh are you sure you really want to do performing arts because it's not like something that's biological I'm not born where I'm just naturally good at math and science I get so tired when people just say that it's such like it's something that's so natural it's not how much hard work is instilled in like the academic system in Taiwan or like the kind of culture and like ideals that your parents instill on to you that's like the stereotype that I really just struggled with growing up in this kind of Taiwanese culture they essentially instilled what they were taught from their parents to put on to like me and my brother they had more of a traditional mindset when it came to gender norms for example for being a female I was expected to be prim and proper not to be too loud like not focusing is it focusing okay yeah often it's like what's expected of a son and what's expected of a daughter and yeah like the things that they have been taught at a young age differs from like the things that I've been taught in college I've taken like classes and woman and Gender Studies classes like those really challenged like the social norms and like gender norms like expectations that are given that was like a huge eye-opener for things that I've always questioned but was never really able to put a firm like stance or belief in a lot of my views that often or sometimes come in clash with my parents are because I take the indoctrinations that they bring to me and I also take like my outside college experience analyzing what are the stances that I believe like what are the values that I hold true I feel like in Western like culture they emphasize on individualism it's that certain sense of like finding your own self and that you're the one who's able to create your own destiny don't know if that really is truly related but like it's somewhat correlated yeah yes I am extremely proud to be telling these American I think both cultures Taiwanese and being American like these really shaped the person that I am there's this way where I can compare and contrast and even like fuse together differing viewpoints I remember I was talking to my dad came back from my first semester of college realizing that being Toni's is something that I'm really proud of and he said like yeah the thing is that you'll always be Taiwanese not American like that's for sure I stopped him and I said the thing is that I don't believe that American means only one thing like being American is being white instead being American is being Korean American being Japanese American his Latin ex American African American and even immigrants make up what is American that's my definition yes you can be both you can be Taiwanese you can be American there should be this part where American capsule eights Taiwanese or like Korean just people who come to the States and just want to be here I really identify with it it's kind of like gratitude that you have because there's so much more to you your ethnicity is important but it's not something that solely defines you our last question my favorite thing about being asian-american is bringing forth a different perspective when I'm in the States or when I'm even in Taiwan dar√≠o types are still so prevalent in our society I can't like tell you how many times I've like had so many microaggressions that were directed at me or like stereotypes that people would use are you kidding me I think being a Taiwanese American really just allows me to be like this advocate against the stereotype there wouldn't be this kind of X like belief that oh I would just breathe in and take it I want people to understand that stereotypes are not the way to allow people to get together instead it just divides other people it really makes me uncomfortable when people just reduce my personality or Who I am as a person to just something so simple and something so offensive I think being Taiwanese American really allows me to just understand that there's still so much to that needs to be done in terms of bringing more representation when it comes to like TV shows or movies because there are so many stereotypes that like you can see in film the great wall for example and assume that white people are the ones that are saving China you would never really understand or realize that there's a certain kind of dignity something that's more magnificent and the actual true story of something then an outsider's viewpoint of a country that's alien that's really just my favorite thing about being an asian-american thank you so much for watching my video I am incredibly thankful for those who watched till the end I will put the questions down below in the description and you can just write in the
