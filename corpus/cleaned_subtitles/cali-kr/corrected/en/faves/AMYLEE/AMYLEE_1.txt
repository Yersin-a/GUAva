AM	AMYLEE	0.03	2.58	saying you don't see race is the most
AM	AMYLEE	2.58	4.41	racist thing you can say being colorblind
AM	AMYLEE	4.41	7.02	is being blind to the thousands of
AM	AMYLEE	7.02	9.24	years of oppression so I'm sorry sister
AM	AMYLEE	9.24	19.619	but I totally see race good morning welcome back to the am with Amy I'm your
AM	AMYLEE	19.619	23.67	lovely host you guessed it Amy_unc and_unc today
AM	AMYLEE	23.67	25.82	we are going to talk about growing up
AM	AMYLEE	25.82	27.99	asian-american and right now I'm just
AM	AMYLEE	27.99	31.14	finishing up my concealer because I
AM	AMYLEE	31.14	32.91	already did my base and my brows so I
AM	AMYLEE	32.91	34.17	can speed up the process a little bit
AM	AMYLEE	34.17	36.239	but I wanted to make this a tag video
AM	AMYLEE	36.239	39.0	just for fun because I know a lot of my
AM	AMYLEE	39.0	40.98	Asian American content creator friends
AM	AMYLEE	40.98	42.93	have expressed concern to me that they
AM	AMYLEE	42.93	44.879	wanted to talk about this but just
AM	AMYLEE	44.879	48.12	didn't really know how to and secondly
AM	AMYLEE	48.12	50.1	if you guys want to do it I would love
AM	AMYLEE	50.1	52.5	for you to answer these questions you
AM	AMYLEE	52.5	54.0	don't have to do your makeup that's just
AM	AMYLEE	54.0	55.89	my thing with the am with Amy I'm
AM	AMYLEE	55.89	58.079	sitting down here drinking tea doing my
AM	AMYLEE	58.079	59.73	makeup talking about some heavy shit
AM	AMYLEE	59.73	63.12	sometimes um but you don't have to do your
AM	AMYLEE	63.12	65.01	makeup so I mean you can but it is a
AM	AMYLEE	65.01	67.59	little bit hot I will say that also if I
AM	AMYLEE	67.59	70.26	sound a little sick it is because I am
AM	AMYLEE	70.26	73.32	on day eight of recovering from I think the
AM	AMYLEE	73.32	76.47	flu so my nose is crazy I have my tea as
AM	AMYLEE	76.47	80.94	I said so just bear with me
AM	AMYLEE	80.94	85.43	korean-american
AM	AMYLEE	85.43	89.21	parents were born in Korea and I was born here in the
AM	AMYLEE	89.21	96.88	states in California
AM	AMYLEE	96.88	99.729	I'm from a city in the Los Angeles
AM	AMYLEE	99.729	101.229	County the Greater Los Angeles County
AM	AMYLEE	101.229	103.39	it's not LA itself but it's in the
AM	AMYLEE	103.39	105.52	county and it's kind of on the border of
AM	AMYLEE	105.52	107.71	LA and Orange County and it's called
AM	AMYLEE	107.71	109.75	Cerritos and for those of you who are
AM	AMYLEE	109.75	113.2	familiar with Cerritos it is very much
AM	AMYLEE	113.2	115.36	so like Irvine it is predominantly Asian
AM	AMYLEE	115.36	117.61	lots of good Asian food lots of boba
AM	AMYLEE	117.61	120.43	spots um but it's just a lot of Asian
AM	AMYLEE	120.43	124.21	families and uh it's just a very Asian
AM	AMYLEE	124.21	127.15	place but the cities neighboring it
AM	AMYLEE	127.15	129.69	like Artesia Bellflower Norwalk are
AM	AMYLEE	129.69	132.7	predominantly Latin or Hispanic
AM	AMYLEE	132.7	135.91	communities and so I think growing up I
AM	AMYLEE	135.91	138.85	never truly felt like a minority but the
AM	AMYLEE	138.85	142.45	first time that I understood that I was
AM	AMYLEE	142.45	144.85	different or I understand it there is a
AM	AMYLEE	144.85	149.44	demarcation between you know me and the
AM	AMYLEE	149.44	152.11	Latin kids or whatever was I remember in
AM	AMYLEE	152.11	154.0	second grade I was probably eight years
AM	AMYLEE	154.0	156.22	old and we were sitting on the classroom
AM	AMYLEE	156.22	159.82	floor and there was a guy named Bobby
AM	AMYLEE	159.82	163.42	who was Mexican I believe and he asked
AM	AMYLEE	163.42	165.01	me straight up to my fai- face
AM	AMYLEE	165.01	168.489	he said Amy why are your eyes so chinky
AM	AMYLEE	168.489	171.22	and I was just like whatever you know
AM	AMYLEE	171.22	173.35	he's just being mean and I kind of
AM	AMYLEE	173.35	175.12	brushed it off but then then he proceeds
AM	AMYLEE	175.12	178.57	to say that there's so chinky that I look
AM	AMYLEE	178.57	180.549	horny and I was eight years old and I
AM	AMYLEE	180.549	183.19	remember distinctly thinking what_unn
AM	AMYLEE	183.19	186.07	What_unn does_unn horny_unn mean_unn like_unn my_unn I_unn look_unn like_unn I_unn have_unn
AM	AMYLEE	186.07	188.23	horns_unn on_unn my_unn face_unn or_unn like_unn I_unn look_unn like_unn a_unn
AM	AMYLEE	188.23	190.959	unicorn_unn I was just so confused and I
AM	AMYLEE	190.959	193.329	said what the heck is horny I was just
AM	AMYLEE	193.329	195.76	like what do you mean and he was just
AM	AMYLEE	195.76	199.06	like never mind he was like just he
AM	AMYLEE	199.06	201.16	just just kind of laughed about that but
AM	AMYLEE	201.16	203.769	I remember he would say that to me a lot
AM	AMYLEE	203.769	205.09	he would always bully me for my eyes
AM	AMYLEE	205.09	207.13	and growing up I did experience quite a
AM	AMYLEE	207.13	209.38	lot of bullying from a lot of the Latin
AM	AMYLEE	209.38	212.14	kids for my eyes but even for me that
AM	AMYLEE	212.14	214.239	was my biggest aha moment that I was
AM	AMYLEE	214.239	216.61	like oh wow my eyes do look different
AM	AMYLEE	216.61	219.25	from them and I'm different from them
AM	AMYLEE	219.25	221.95	and that is when that kind of all
AM	AMYLEE	221.95	224.23	started as a concept I also really
AM	AMYLEE	224.23	226.88	wanted to learn what horny was but I didn't
AM	AMYLEE	226.88	229.49	find that out til like way later I feel like <lgh> what's crazy
AM	AMYLEE	229.49	232.19	to me is that happen so long ago when we
AM	AMYLEE	232.19	234.53	were in second grade and I remember
AM	AMYLEE	234.53	235.22	exactly
AM	AMYLEE	235.22	237.53	his full name which I will not say and
AM	AMYLEE	237.53	239.21	what he looked like and where we were
AM	AMYLEE	239.21	242.3	and exactly how I felt and it just it's
AM	AMYLEE	242.3	244.46	like crystal clear in my memory even
AM	AMYLEE	244.46	245.99	though everything else from second grade
AM	AMYLEE	245.99	252.16	is really not that clear <lgh>
AM	AMYLEE	252.16	255.13	so elementary school was pretty okay and
AM	AMYLEE	255.13	257.32	I feel like I got bullied mainly for how
AM	AMYLEE	257.32	259.78	chinky my eyes were and I can't really
AM	AMYLEE	259.78	262.51	remember what race they were so I really
AM	AMYLEE	262.51	263.83	can't tell if they were Asian people
AM	AMYLEE	263.83	265.66	also making fun of me because Asian people have
AM	AMYLEE	265.66	267.43	also made fun of me for my chinky eyes
AM	AMYLEE	267.43	270.76	which is so bizarre but anyways uh so
AM	AMYLEE	270.76	273.01	middle school is definitely when I felt uh
AM	AMYLEE	273.01	276.22	there were a lot more Hispanic people or
AM	AMYLEE	276.22	278.83	Latin people and I would be bullied for
AM	AMYLEE	278.83	281.08	being Asian or for being too smart or
AM	AMYLEE	281.08	283.24	why I always got A's on tests or
AM	AMYLEE	283.24	284.44	whatever kind of falling into that
AM	AMYLEE	284.44	287.56	model minority myth but high school is
AM	AMYLEE	287.56	290.08	when I finally went to Cerritos high
AM	AMYLEE	290.08	292.39	school which is a school that was not on
AM	AMYLEE	292.39	294.13	anywhere of the border of these
AM	AMYLEE	294.13	297.94	neighboring cities and it was all Asian
AM	AMYLEE	297.94	299.92	kids I remember going to the first day
AM	AMYLEE	299.92	302.2	of school and I was like whoa there's so
AM	AMYLEE	302.2	304.15	many people here that look like me and
AM	AMYLEE	304.15	305.53	I would come to school and it'd just be
AM	AMYLEE	305.53	307.6	like a group of Asian kids like smoking
AM	AMYLEE	307.6	309.97	and listening to like fly like a g6 and
AM	AMYLEE	309.97	312.94	it was just very it- I just felt like I was
AM	AMYLEE	312.94	315.01	like in a Far East Movement music video
AM	AMYLEE	315.01	317.74	It just so many Asian kids some who thought
AM	AMYLEE	317.74	320.17	they were cool there were nerdy ones whereas in
AM	AMYLEE	320.17	322.18	middle school you know Asian kids were
AM	AMYLEE	322.18	325.21	just like nerdy and one-dimensional in
AM	AMYLEE	325.21	326.86	that sense because we were surrounded
AM	AMYLEE	326.86	328.9	with other minorities but in high
AM	AMYLEE	328.9	332.23	schools it was all Asian people and we had you
AM	AMYLEE	332.23	334.27	know Asian nerds the cool Asians like
AM	AMYLEE	334.27	337.66	in Mean Girls and um the- the Asian jocks
AM	AMYLEE	337.66	340.12	the entire football team was Asian we
AM	AMYLEE	340.12	342.1	literally had no diversity in this
AM	AMYLEE	342.1	344.98	school and so I think that was when I
AM	AMYLEE	344.98	347.41	realized like oh my gosh I'm surrounded
AM	AMYLEE	347.41	349.33	by so many people like me and who I am
AM	AMYLEE	349.33	351.88	as a person I think I've always been a
AM	AMYLEE	351.88	356.65	very anti-establishment and very- I like
AM	AMYLEE	356.65	358.6	to stray from the norm and I'm very I
AM	AMYLEE	358.6	360.52	don't like conformity I don't like if
AM	AMYLEE	360.52	362.2	everyone says to do this I'm always like
AM	AMYLEE	362.2	364.87	why why why and so soon as I got into
AM	AMYLEE	364.87	366.97	high school I noticed that a lot of like
AM	AMYLEE	366.97	369.01	the cool Asians with popular kids were
AM	AMYLEE	369.01	371.65	really into like R&B and hip-hop and
AM	AMYLEE	371.65	373.63	they were amazing at dancing and
AM	AMYLEE	373.63	377.29	choreography and our drill team or dance
AM	AMYLEE	377.29	379.03	show team was like so good they were
AM	AMYLEE	379.03	381.19	always competing and I was just like
AM	AMYLEE	381.19	385.38	okay that's what's cool but to me I
AM	AMYLEE	385.38	389.13	didn't want to be that way and so I think i-_unc in my
AM	AMYLEE	389.13	391.26	high school it is very normal and cool to
AM	AMYLEE	391.26	393.21	be Asian because literally everyone is
AM	AMYLEE	393.21	395.07	Asian and that is the norm and so I
AM	AMYLEE	395.07	397.5	think I started to really reject my
AM	AMYLEE	397.5	401.22	culture when I was in- fifteen when I was 15
AM	AMYLEE	401.22	404.34	to like seventeen years old because I was just
AM	AMYLEE	404.34	408.3	not I just didn't want to fit in with
AM	AMYLEE	408.3	410.43	that crowd and so if everyone was
AM	AMYLEE	410.43	412.47	listening to R&B and hip-hop I wanted to go
AM	AMYLEE	412.47	414.36	listen to rock and like heavy metal and
AM	AMYLEE	414.36	417.06	that's when I discovered I made it and
AM	AMYLEE	417.06	419.55	Slayer Metallica and stuff like that and
AM	AMYLEE	419.55	421.98	if everyone was wearing like this
AM	AMYLEE	421.98	424.86	certain type of shoe like I would want
AM	AMYLEE	424.86	425.82	to wear something completely different
AM	AMYLEE	425.82	428.1	from that and so in high school I really
AM	AMYLEE	428.1	429.99	started to reject my Asian culture I
AM	AMYLEE	429.99	432.51	didn't even drink boba boba is
AM	AMYLEE	432.51	435.33	like the hugest thing in cerritos like
AM	AMYLEE	435.33	437.7	people go out to boba spots at 2
AM	AMYLEE	437.7	440.07	am and that's like it's- it's like a
AM	AMYLEE	440.07	441.96	thing it's an activity and I remember
AM	AMYLEE	441.96	443.37	all throughout high school I only
AM	AMYLEE	443.37	445.2	started liking boba until I met one of
AM	AMYLEE	445.2	447.57	my best friends Sharon who got me
AM	AMYLEE	447.57	448.59	addicted to boba
AM	AMYLEE	448.59	450.87	but even then I just- I just- I just
AM	AMYLEE	450.87	452.43	didn't want any part of it
AM	AMYLEE	452.43	454.44	and I think a lot of that was because I
AM	AMYLEE	454.44	456.81	just didn't want to be like everybody
AM	AMYLEE	456.81	458.79	else I just really didn't wanna
AM	AMYLEE	458.79	460.2	identify with that and all my
AM	AMYLEE	460.2	461.82	personality tests if you guys believe in
AM	AMYLEE	461.82	463.83	like the myers-briggs like INT- I'm an INTJ
AM	AMYLEE	463.83	465.51	And if you believe in the zodiac
AM	AMYLEE	465.51	467.49	I'm an Aquarius and all of my personality
AM	AMYLEE	467.49	469.04	tests always talk about how
AM	AMYLEE	469.04	472.83	nonconformist I am I even won uh best dressed
AM	AMYLEE	472.83	474.53	in high school my senior year and I
AM	AMYLEE	474.53	477.69	hated that I won it because I always
AM	AMYLEE	477.69	479.25	felt one_unc one I thought none of the
AM	AMYLEE	479.25	480.75	electives were actually indicative of
AM	AMYLEE	480.75	483.09	how that person actually was so best
AM	AMYLEE	483.09	484.44	dressed was never really that best dressed
AM	AMYLEE	484.44	486.06	and like most_unc most likely to succeed
AM	AMYLEE	486.06	488.85	would never really be successful and two I
AM	AMYLEE	488.85	490.86	hated that it was a popularity contest it
AM	AMYLEE	490.86	493.35	was completely not backed on anything
AM	AMYLEE	493.35	495.15	other than whether or not people knew
AM	AMYLEE	495.15	497.25	you and liked you and stuff like that so
AM	AMYLEE	497.25	499.11	I actually stayed home from that day
AM	AMYLEE	499.11	500.64	when they announced it and they crowned you and
AM	AMYLEE	500.64	502.56	put you up on stage and gave you a sash
AM	AMYLEE	502.56	506.25	a fucking sash so that was when I was eighteen
AM	AMYLEE	506.25	507.9	and I think that's when I became way
AM	AMYLEE	507.9	510.72	more in tune with myself and my politics
AM	AMYLEE	510.72	512.789	and where I stand because that is
AM	AMYLEE	512.789	514.86	definitely the last year that I strayed
AM	AMYLEE	514.86	517.79	away from wanting to not be Asian
AM	AMYLEE	517.79	519.41	if that makes sense I think that was
AM	AMYLEE	519.41	522.53	when I was rejecting what I thought was
AM	AMYLEE	522.53	524.72	to be_unc perceived_unc as being Asian which was
AM	AMYLEE	524.72	526.13	like listening to Far East Movement but
AM	AMYLEE	526.13	527.69	it's hard to say that I wouldn't assimilate
AM	AMYLEE	527.69	529.1	if I went to a predominately
AM	AMYLEE	529.1	531.05	white school because I didn't go to a
AM	AMYLEE	531.05	532.4	predominantly white school and I- who's
AM	AMYLEE	532.4	534.38	to say I wouldn't veer from the norm
AM	AMYLEE	534.38	536.18	then because maybe I wouldn't want to
AM	AMYLEE	536.18	538.28	fit in then I don't know so it's hard to
AM	AMYLEE	538.28	539.81	say it but I just do know that my
AM	AMYLEE	539.81	541.58	experience is very idiosyncratic to me
AM	AMYLEE	541.58	543.47	because a lot of people I talk to don't
AM	AMYLEE	543.47	545.36	have this experience of like literally
AM	AMYLEE	545.36	548.36	my graduation when they said all the
AM	AMYLEE	548.36	550.43	names it was like Pak Pak Pak Lee Lee
AM	AMYLEE	550.43	552.47	Lee Kim Kim Kim Cheng Cheng Cheng Cheng Cheng Cheng Cheng Cheng
AM	AMYLEE	552.47	554.27	Cheng Cheng Cheng Cheng Cheng for like
AM	AMYLEE	554.27	556.51	hours and I was probably the twentieth
AM	AMYLEE	556.51	559.37	Lee that they said and when I tell that to
AM	AMYLEE	559.37	560.69	people they're like what the heck that's
AM	AMYLEE	560.69	561.41	crazy
AM	AMYLEE	561.41	565.01	so but I just do know that uh I perceived
AM	AMYLEE	565.01	567.8	Asian being Asian American to be s- a
AM	AMYLEE	567.8	570.02	certain way in high school because I was
AM	AMYLEE	570.02	572.3	surrounded by that one type of image and
AM	AMYLEE	572.3	576.87	so I wanted to veer from that
AM	AMYLEE	576.87	579.36	one of them is the model minority myth
AM	AMYLEE	579.36	581.69	and that type of stereotype because
AM	AMYLEE	581.69	586.38	growing up for me it's- we're all as
AM	AMYLEE	586.38	588.3	Asians we're expected to be good at math
AM	AMYLEE	588.3	594.45	and to just be naturally- naturally
AM	AMYLEE	594.45	598.589	gifted s- in matters of school and academia
AM	AMYLEE	598.589	602.779	and I am also the second child and so uh
AM	AMYLEE	602.779	607.13	growing up I was never ever you know <unk>
AM	AMYLEE	607.13	610.2	superbly brilliant as I'm sure a lot of
AM	AMYLEE	610.2	613.589	you are not as well but I think being
AM	AMYLEE	613.589	616.529	compared to my older brother I was
AM	AMYLEE	616.529	618.95	always kind of seen as a lot less
AM	AMYLEE	618.95	622.41	intellectual or smart and so I feel like
AM	AMYLEE	622.41	624.0	I always grew up with this underdog
AM	AMYLEE	624.0	626.55	mentality which then propelled me to
AM	AMYLEE	626.55	630.779	stay after school ask for tutoring uh come
AM	AMYLEE	630.779	633.029	before school and really really study
AM	AMYLEE	633.029	635.64	the extra hour it's like I would go crazy
AM	AMYLEE	635.64	638.37	with note cards I literally had a color
AM	AMYLEE	638.37	640.529	chart for color coding with my
AM	AMYLEE	640.529	642.87	highlighters and that has always been
AM	AMYLEE	642.87	645.36	the driving force as to why I worked so
AM	AMYLEE	645.36	648.03	hard and it has nothing to do with me
AM	AMYLEE	648.03	650.13	being Asian and being this model
AM	AMYLEE	650.13	652.2	minority and being naturally gifted for
AM	AMYLEE	652.2	653.94	me personally it was because I was always
AM	AMYLEE	653.94	655.77	told that I was not very smart growing
AM	AMYLEE	655.77	657.45	up and always being compared to someone
AM	AMYLEE	657.45	660.48	and so that drove me and my insecurities
AM	AMYLEE	660.48	664.11	to not be that way and so the model
AM	AMYLEE	664.11	666.66	minority just tells us that as Asians we
AM	AMYLEE	666.66	669.51	are naturally good at math we are good
AM	AMYLEE	669.51	672.72	at sciences and you know it has nothing
AM	AMYLEE	672.72	674.55	to do with how hard we work and I find
AM	AMYLEE	674.55	675.839	that the model minority is so
AM	AMYLEE	675.839	677.3	destructive for a lot of my
AM	AMYLEE	677.3	680.01	asian-american friends who uh no matter how
AM	AMYLEE	680.01	682.17	hard they study or no matter how hard
AM	AMYLEE	682.17	684.089	they work they just cannot get the
AM	AMYLEE	684.089	685.92	results that their parents want or that
AM	AMYLEE	685.92	687.99	society deems that we should have it's
AM	AMYLEE	687.99	689.82	like they work their ass off and still
AM	AMYLEE	689.82	693.0	cannot get even you know a C on the test
AM	AMYLEE	693.0	694.56	and I find that that's so detrimental
AM	AMYLEE	694.56	697.5	because so many of us don't fit into
AM	AMYLEE	697.5	699.45	that model minority I know so many of my
AM	AMYLEE	699.45	700.74	friends who are not good at math and um
AM	AMYLEE	700.74	703.1	honestly I'm only good at math now
AM	AMYLEE	703.1	705.11	because I stayed before and after class
AM	AMYLEE	705.11	707.42	to get tutored on it literally calculus
AM	AMYLEE	707.42	709.28	I remember going in to k- school at like
AM	AMYLEE	709.28	711.07	5 am and then leaving at five pm
AM	AMYLEE	711.07	713.42	because I just wanted to get tutored on
AM	AMYLEE	713.42	715.46	calculus and I've always had a lot of
AM	AMYLEE	715.46	717.41	extra help in the sense that I use Khan
AM	AMYLEE	717.41	720.08	Academy and I asked the smartest kid in
AM	AMYLEE	720.08	723.02	class to tutor me but that's not to say
AM	AMYLEE	723.02	725.24	that I'm naturally gifted at all these
AM	AMYLEE	725.24	726.95	things without trying I find that it's
AM	AMYLEE	726.95	728.93	problematic because it really minimizes
AM	AMYLEE	728.93	731.48	people's work ethic and the actual sweat
AM	AMYLEE	731.48	732.89	and dedication they put into it as
AM	AMYLEE	732.89	734.99	opposed to genetically being predisposed
AM	AMYLEE	734.99	738.86	to being good at math or school another
AM	AMYLEE	738.86	740.66	one that I have a hard time grappling
AM	AMYLEE	740.66	745.19	with is being this submissive trophy
AM	AMYLEE	745.19	748.4	wife and I took a lot of classes of this
AM	AMYLEE	748.4	751.84	on this at UCLA Asian American feminism um
AM	AMYLEE	751.84	754.19	specifically because it was very
AM	AMYLEE	754.19	756.02	interesting to see the underpinnings of
AM	AMYLEE	756.02	759.11	how Asian American women became this you
AM	AMYLEE	759.11	760.79	know submissive trophy wife that's
AM	AMYLEE	760.79	763.34	supposed to be sexually promiscuous and
AM	AMYLEE	763.34	765.29	also really obedient all at the same
AM	AMYLEE	765.29	769.67	time and um it's really weird because when
AM	AMYLEE	769.67	771.62	I date people outside of my race people
AM	AMYLEE	771.62	774.11	will say blah blah blah worshippers so if I
AM	AMYLEE	774.11	775.7	date you know like a white man they'll say
AM	AMYLEE	775.7	777.23	white man worshipper or if I date
AM	AMYLEE	777.23	780.56	someone um black like oh you have jungle
AM	AMYLEE	780.56	782.75	fever and I'm s- I'm sure a lot of- I
AM	AMYLEE	782.75	785.45	mean- all- all races definitely have this
AM	AMYLEE	785.45	787.58	being that whole s- so having that
AM	AMYLEE	787.58	789.62	stereotype on you it kind of makes you
AM	AMYLEE	789.62	791.36	wary when you're dating outside of your
AM	AMYLEE	791.36	794.6	race to know it to try and gauge whether
AM	AMYLEE	794.6	796.52	or not someone has quote-unquote yellow
AM	AMYLEE	796.52	797.93	fever are they asking me out because
AM	AMYLEE	797.93	799.55	they have a fetish are they asking me
AM	AMYLEE	799.55	802.31	out because they fetishized Asian women
AM	AMYLEE	802.31	805.64	and what that entails and for me I have
AM	AMYLEE	805.64	807.92	dated all races I know that I've showed
AM	AMYLEE	807.92	810.77	one relationship here on YouTube and you
AM	AMYLEE	810.77	812.15	guys probably think that's the only race
AM	AMYLEE	812.15	813.68	that I date but I'm a very open-minded
AM	AMYLEE	813.68	817.4	person I really truly date all races I
AM	AMYLEE	817.4	819.38	feel like it's more of a- for me it's
AM	AMYLEE	819.38	821.69	more of a taste issue like do we have
AM	AMYLEE	821.69	824.3	similar taste and in- whether that's in
AM	AMYLEE	824.3	828.41	music or food or clothes do we have the
AM	AMYLEE	828.41	831.16	same taste and taste is definitely
AM	AMYLEE	831.16	833.3	all-inclusive as far as race but I'm
AM	AMYLEE	833.3	834.36	here I'm not here to
AM	AMYLEE	834.36	836.399	say oh I don't see race that's why I date all
AM	AMYLEE	836.399	839.16	races saying you don't see race is the
AM	AMYLEE	839.16	840.99	most racist thing you can say being
AM	AMYLEE	840.99	843.269	colorblind is being blind to the
AM	AMYLEE	843.269	845.25	thousands of years of oppression and
AM	AMYLEE	845.25	847.68	systematic incarceration so I'm sorry
AM	AMYLEE	847.68	850.92	sister but I totally see race but uh for me
AM	AMYLEE	850.92	853.13	dating-wise it's just a taste thing so
AM	AMYLEE	853.13	855.93	anyways but yeah so just dealing with
AM	AMYLEE	855.93	858.51	that is very interesting and I make it a
AM	AMYLEE	858.51	860.279	point not to date people who
AM	AMYLEE	860.279	863.79	specifically only date Asian women and
AM	AMYLEE	863.79	865.35	that's just personal preference to me
AM	AMYLEE	865.35	867.029	It also shows that they're not super
AM	AMYLEE	867.029	868.829	open-minded like I am so there's a
AM	AMYLEE	868.829	870.42	couple reasons why I don't date people
AM	AMYLEE	870.42	873.839	who only date Asian women um and I guess it
AM	AMYLEE	873.839	875.67	is because I am a little bit marred from
AM	AMYLEE	875.67	877.829	that stereotype actually I'm probably a
AM	AMYLEE	877.829	881.95	lot marred <lgh>
AM	AMYLEE	881.95	884.8	I speak like that of a four-year-old I
AM	AMYLEE	884.8	888.64	can ask for directions I can't order
AM	AMYLEE	888.64	891.25	food ask for more food ask where the
AM	AMYLEE	891.25	892.21	bathroom is
AM	AMYLEE	892.21	897.31	but I really can't have a huge
AM	AMYLEE	897.31	903.11	conversation in Korean
AM	AMYLEE	903.11	905.81	you guys have a bet my entire family now
AM	AMYLEE	905.81	907.85	here on YouTube I have videos with my
AM	AMYLEE	907.85	908.269	brother
AM	AMYLEE	908.269	911.209	my mom and now my dad my last video was
AM	AMYLEE	911.209	913.82	my dad picks my outfits which you guys
AM	AMYLEE	913.82	915.23	can watch up here in the cards it's
AM	AMYLEE	915.23	916.7	pretty funny so as you guys might have
AM	AMYLEE	916.7	919.22	guessed but I have a very strong and
AM	AMYLEE	919.22	921.47	close and positive relationship with
AM	AMYLEE	921.47	923.45	both of my parents and I find that
AM	AMYLEE	923.45	925.64	that's because one they're super
AM	AMYLEE	925.64	927.47	open-minded for being korean-american
AM	AMYLEE	927.47	930.01	parents and two they trust me there are
AM	AMYLEE	930.01	932.6	definitely some cultural differences and
AM	AMYLEE	932.6	935.0	sometimes politics that don't align but
AM	AMYLEE	935.0	937.91	we both understand and recognize that as
AM	AMYLEE	937.91	941.269	a cultural thing and you know creating
AM	AMYLEE	941.269	942.649	politics are definitely not as
AM	AMYLEE	942.649	945.019	progressive and I consider myself super
AM	AMYLEE	945.019	948.23	super liberal I am very very liberal and
AM	AMYLEE	948.23	950.69	I'm very open-minded and so hey I think
AM	AMYLEE	950.69	952.61	the only thing that sucks about being
AM	AMYLEE	952.61	954.68	Korean American is that because I don't
AM	AMYLEE	954.68	956.87	speak my language very well I can never
AM	AMYLEE	956.87	959.69	ever get to know my dad or really talk
AM	AMYLEE	959.69	961.399	about where my family is from like my
AM	AMYLEE	961.399	963.17	grandparents my great-grandparents and
AM	AMYLEE	963.17	965.36	that really honestly breaks my heart and
AM	AMYLEE	965.36	967.67	if there's any driving force to me
AM	AMYLEE	967.67	969.05	learning my language it's so that I
AM	AMYLEE	969.05	970.519	could one day sit down and talk to my
AM	AMYLEE	970.519	972.62	dog about politics and philosophy
AM	AMYLEE	972.62	975.649	because my mom speaks fluent English and
AM	AMYLEE	975.649	978.05	so I'm super open with her about the cut
AM	AMYLEE	978.05	979.82	we can talk about the economy we can
AM	AMYLEE	979.82	981.82	talk about politics we can talk about
AM	AMYLEE	981.82	984.17	philosophy we can talk about pretty much
AM	AMYLEE	984.17	985.88	anything and I feel super close to her
AM	AMYLEE	985.88	987.949	but was my dad it sucks because I can
AM	AMYLEE	987.949	991.1	barely speak about you know what's going
AM	AMYLEE	991.1	993.29	on with our current geopolitical climate
AM	AMYLEE	993.29	995.899	and I think he's such as wise and smart
AM	AMYLEE	995.899	998.149	and an intellectual guy that it really
AM	AMYLEE	998.149	999.86	makes me sad that I can't talk to him
AM	AMYLEE	999.86	1000.67	because he's always reading the
AM	AMYLEE	1000.67	1001.959	newspaper and he seems really really
AM	AMYLEE	1001.959	1005.74	woke in layman's terms but I think
AM	AMYLEE	1005.74	1007.23	that's the biggest thing about being
AM	AMYLEE	1007.23	1009.04	korean-american and the language we're
AM	AMYLEE	1009.04	1010.93	here is that it really hinders my
AM	AMYLEE	1010.93	1013.42	relationship with both my dad and any
AM	AMYLEE	1013.42	1017.11	one of my grandparents
AM	AMYLEE	1017.11	1021.94	as of today I am 100 150 percent so
AM	AMYLEE	1021.94	1024.13	proud to be korean-american even though
AM	AMYLEE	1024.13	1026.92	I'm so for unity and dismantling of
AM	AMYLEE	1026.92	1029.29	racial segregation I do believe that
AM	AMYLEE	1029.29	1031.24	culture is such a beautiful thing and
AM	AMYLEE	1031.24	1032.38	culture or something that should be
AM	AMYLEE	1032.38	1034.809	celebrated and it's honestly what makes
AM	AMYLEE	1034.809	1037.39	this world so beautiful and colorful and
AM	AMYLEE	1037.39	1039.97	even if I wasn't Korean I would have if
AM	AMYLEE	1039.97	1041.589	I was Nigerian I would have a Nigeria
AM	AMYLEE	1041.589	1043.72	tattoo if I was Chinese I would have a
AM	AMYLEE	1043.72	1045.4	Chinese tattoo I think culture is
AM	AMYLEE	1045.4	1046.959	something and heritage is something that
AM	AMYLEE	1046.959	1049.36	should be celebrated soon as I hit eighteen I
AM	AMYLEE	1049.36	1050.799	really honed in on what it meant to be
AM	AMYLEE	1050.799	1053.77	Korean American and towards the end of
AM	AMYLEE	1053.77	1056.95	my college career I had a lot of extra
AM	AMYLEE	1056.95	1059.47	classes to take for fun like a lot of
AM	AMYLEE	1059.47	1062.5	units to just basically use up and I
AM	AMYLEE	1062.5	1064.57	think my last corner it was I
AM	AMYLEE	1064.57	1067.09	strategically made it out so that I
AM	AMYLEE	1067.09	1069.37	could only take classes that I really
AM	AMYLEE	1069.37	1070.99	want to so I took an art history class
AM	AMYLEE	1070.99	1073.78	and then all the other ones on the first
AM	AMYLEE	1073.78	1075.73	day it was like what it means to be
AM	AMYLEE	1075.73	1077.74	Korean or asian-american
AM	AMYLEE	1077.74	1079.75	and I took asian-american feminism it's
AM	AMYLEE	1079.75	1082.09	a Korean history formation of Koreatown
AM	AMYLEE	1082.09	1083.53	I think that was the class and then I
AM	AMYLEE	1083.53	1086.02	also took an entire year of the Korean
AM	AMYLEE	1086.02	1088.0	language and I still suck at it but I
AM	AMYLEE	1088.0	1089.74	never went to class it says he know
AM	AMYLEE	1089.74	1092.169	which in Korean means literally exert
AM	AMYLEE	1092.169	1094.12	strength but it's something that Korean
AM	AMYLEE	1094.12	1096.429	people say as far as you know like cheer
AM	AMYLEE	1096.429	1098.77	up keep going like endure it like stay
AM	AMYLEE	1098.77	1101.32	strong so you say he knit or white team
AM	AMYLEE	1101.32	1102.94	fight team it's kind of the same thing
AM	AMYLEE	1102.94	1105.7	and it's basically just saying how for
AM	AMYLEE	1105.7	1108.19	me Korea if you learned about its
AM	AMYLEE	1108.19	1110.14	culture and its politics and its
AM	AMYLEE	1110.14	1112.0	historical background it has been
AM	AMYLEE	1112.0	1113.77	divided by so many different other
AM	AMYLEE	1113.77	1116.14	external forces and the fact that it
AM	AMYLEE	1116.14	1118.419	still remains and is strong I'm just
AM	AMYLEE	1118.419	1120.179	like Korean people are resilient and
AM	AMYLEE	1120.179	1122.799	it's it's just not staying strong and
AM	AMYLEE	1122.799	1124.33	it's a it's definitely paying homage a
AM	AMYLEE	1124.33	1126.94	lot of omage to my Korean culture I will
AM	AMYLEE	1126.94	1129.49	say that I do not listen to modern-day
AM	AMYLEE	1129.49	1132.34	Korean music because I know a lot of
AM	AMYLEE	1132.34	1134.679	people love kpop but honestly I don't
AM	AMYLEE	1134.679	1137.35	really listen to even American pop let
AM	AMYLEE	1137.35	1140.32	alone like other people's pop music but
AM	AMYLEE	1140.32	1142.69	if there was like a Korean Stevie Nicks
AM	AMYLEE	1142.69	1145.09	you know I would be down I mean any one
AM	AMYLEE	1145.09	1145.91	of my friends
AM	AMYLEE	1145.91	1148.61	I'm so proud of my culture because when
AM	AMYLEE	1148.61	1150.77	I moved out into my own place here we
AM	AMYLEE	1150.77	1154.94	are I could have lived anywhere in LA
AM	AMYLEE	1154.94	1158.24	any neighborhood in LA because it was my
AM	AMYLEE	1158.24	1160.73	jurisdiction and of all the places I
AM	AMYLEE	1160.73	1162.74	chose to live in Korea town I live in
AM	AMYLEE	1162.74	1165.59	Koreatown and so many of my friends are
AM	AMYLEE	1165.59	1167.15	like Amy's the ambassador of Koreatown
AM	AMYLEE	1167.15	1169.01	she literally knows every plot every
AM	AMYLEE	1169.01	1171.89	place every pot every sways every spot
AM	AMYLEE	1171.89	1173.84	every place in Koreatown definitely love
AM	AMYLEE	1173.84	1175.79	Koreatown and I think the reason why I
AM	AMYLEE	1175.79	1177.86	love Korea tells so much I remember even
AM	AMYLEE	1177.86	1179.51	at UCLA I used to drive all the way out
AM	AMYLEE	1179.51	1181.34	from Westwood to Koreatown which is
AM	AMYLEE	1181.34	1183.62	almost like a 40-minute drive with
AM	AMYLEE	1183.62	1185.3	traffic if you guys have been to LA
AM	AMYLEE	1185.3	1188.24	Koreatown is still very Korean it has so
AM	AMYLEE	1188.24	1189.98	many mom-and-pop shops and pulling the
AM	AMYLEE	1189.98	1191.84	walls but it's also in the process of
AM	AMYLEE	1191.84	1193.67	being very gentrified there are so many
AM	AMYLEE	1193.67	1196.01	new high-rise apartment buildings luxury
AM	AMYLEE	1196.01	1197.72	apartment buildings and there are so
AM	AMYLEE	1197.72	1199.61	many hot spots for going out so many
AM	AMYLEE	1199.61	1201.68	cool bars and so many hipster little
AM	AMYLEE	1201.68	1204.02	cafes shops if you want an Instagram
AM	AMYLEE	1204.02	1206.12	Abul cafe place Koreatown is chock-full
AM	AMYLEE	1206.12	1208.52	of them and so I feel like it's the
AM	AMYLEE	1208.52	1211.13	perfect amalgamation of being Korean and
AM	AMYLEE	1211.13	1212.42	being American and so I feel like
AM	AMYLEE	1212.42	1213.82	Koreatown is a very strong
AM	AMYLEE	1213.82	1215.42	representation of Who I am
AM	AMYLEE	1215.42	1217.7	it's like I still at my heart have very
AM	AMYLEE	1217.7	1220.28	Korean aspects and at the foundation I
AM	AMYLEE	1220.28	1223.46	am a Korean person but I had a pink
AM	AMYLEE	1223.46	1225.35	gentrified no that's all but a little
AM	AMYLEE	1225.35	1227.63	very traditional but still modern and
AM	AMYLEE	1227.63	1231.51	progressive all at the same time
AM	AMYLEE	1231.51	1233.64	honestly because I love food so much I'm
AM	AMYLEE	1233.64	1235.56	probably just gonna say the food because
AM	AMYLEE	1235.56	1239.46	I can enjoy a nice vegan bowl of kale
AM	AMYLEE	1239.46	1242.58	and quinoa with hummus and couscous but
AM	AMYLEE	1242.58	1244.65	I can also go down for some you know
AM	AMYLEE	1244.65	1247.56	beef table or some bone marrow soup with
AM	AMYLEE	1247.56	1252.09	oxtail and I love that I can enjoy two
AM	AMYLEE	1252.09	1254.85	types of cuisines and really feel at
AM	AMYLEE	1254.85	1256.83	home with both of them because I love
AM	AMYLEE	1256.83	1258.63	food I love Korean food I love American
AM	AMYLEE	1258.63	1260.07	food I love cheeseburgers on front
AM	AMYLEE	1260.07	1261.96	drives I think it kale food I love it
AM	AMYLEE	1261.96	1266.85	all I love it all so that is the end of
AM	AMYLEE	1266.85	1268.65	the tag by the way I wanted to quickly
