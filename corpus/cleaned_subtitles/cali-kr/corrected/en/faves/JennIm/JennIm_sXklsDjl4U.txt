Je	JennIm	8.1	10.76	and I am so excited to film this video for you guys
Je	JennIm	10.76	14.53	because the month of May is Asian Pacific Heritage Month
Je	JennIm	14.53	16.61	and in the spirit of that I thought that it would be
Je	JennIm	16.61	19.49	very timely to do the Asian American tag
Je	JennIm	19.49	22.13	I wanted to share with you guys my experience
Je	JennIm	22.13	25.5	growing up Asian American and my friend Amy gave
Je	JennIm	25.5	28.71	this whole concept structure and made it very simple
Je	JennIm	28.71	31.4	by creating questions and so I just wanna
Je	JennIm	31.4	33.67	dive right into it so let's get started
Je	JennIm	33.67	35.07	I am Korean-American
Je	JennIm	35.07	37.51	I was born and raised in Southern California
Je	JennIm	37.51	39.46	So my parents immigrated from Korea
Je	JennIm	39.46	41.54	and they first moved to Chile
Je	JennIm	41.54	43.94	and that's where my mom had my brother
Je	JennIm	43.94	46.2	but after my parents got their green card
Je	JennIm	46.2	49.69	they were able to come to America and they had me
Je	JennIm	49.69	52.82	And so I would categorize me and my brother
Je	JennIm	52.82	55.84	as first-generation because like my parents didn't speak
Je	JennIm	55.84	58.37	any English so we were truly the first generation
Je	JennIm	58.37	60.561	to really grow up American here
Je	JennIm	60.561	64.04	The first experience when I realized that I was different
Je	JennIm	64.04	67.07	from the rest of the kids was when I was
Je	JennIm	67.07	71.34	in first or second grade my mom packed my favorite food
Je	JennIm	71.34	74.45	which was kare rice which is basically just curry
Je	JennIm	74.45	76.37	with rice and it has vegetables and meat
Je	JennIm	76.37	78.53	and it's so delicious and I remember
Je	JennIm	78.53	80.15	being so excited to eat it for lunchtime
Je	JennIm	80.15	82.74	and when I opened the Tupperware I remember a kid
Je	JennIm	82.74	85.69	looking at it and just being so disgusted
Je	JennIm	85.69	89.67	and he just called me out he was like
Je	JennIm	89.67	93.76	and I remember being so mortified and so embarrassed
Je	JennIm	93.76	96.01	and I just completely lost my appetite
Je	JennIm	96.01	98.24	and I don't I didn't even eat that lunch
Je	JennIm	98.24	100.86	and when I got home I told my Mom that I never wanted her
Je	JennIm	100.86	102.93	to pack things like this again
Je	JennIm	102.93	105.77	I told her that I only wanted her to pack like Lunchables
Je	JennIm	105.77	107.89	and sandwiches just like normal American food
Je	JennIm	107.89	108.93	so that I would fit in
Je	JennIm	108.93	110.43	When I was younger there was a period where
Je	JennIm	110.43	111.922	I was super proud to be Korean
Je	JennIm	111.922	116.0	It happened when I was around like nine years old
Je	JennIm	116.0	118.23	My mom took me and my brother to Korea
Je	JennIm	118.23	120.16	for the entire summer and we stayed at my aunt's
Je	JennIm	120.16	122.43	and it was such an amazing experience because for once
Je	JennIm	122.43	124.5	like I realized like that everyone looked like me
Je	JennIm	124.5	128.417	and I felt really just like I just felt like I connected
Je	JennIm	128.417	131.69	with everybody and I remember always hanging out
Je	JennIm	131.69	134.02	at this park where all the kids used to hang out
Je	JennIm	134.02	136.51	and I made a lot of friends because everyone was so
Je	JennIm	136.51	139.55	fascinated at the fact that I was American
Je	JennIm	139.55	142.23	And so I would bring like chapter books that I'd packed
Je	JennIm	142.23	145.731	and I'd be like speaks in foreign language
Je	JennIm	145.731	148.31	and everyone was like so impressed and it was just
Je	JennIm	148.31	150.91	it was just a really great time for me
Je	JennIm	150.91	153.93	and that's when I was really just like proud of my culture
Je	JennIm	153.93	157.74	and when I brought that back to America like that
Je	JennIm	157.74	160.07	that pride stayed there for a little bit
Je	JennIm	160.07	163.93	until I went to middle school and middle school was
Je	JennIm	163.93	166.75	when everything just kind of changed for me
Je	JennIm	166.75	168.79	I feel like it was a lot of factors just hitting
Je	JennIm	168.79	170.21	all when I was like 11
Je	JennIm	170.21	173.62	It was puberty it was the fact that I was like chubby
Je	JennIm	173.62	176.48	and then the fact that like there weren't that many
Je	JennIm	176.48	178.27	Asians in my school
Je	JennIm	178.27	179.75	I remember there was a group of these boys
Je	JennIm	179.75	182.21	that walked the same route as me home
Je	JennIm	182.21	185.6	and I remember hating when we would like cross paths
Je	JennIm	185.6	187.33	because they would always say something to me
Je	JennIm	187.33	190.31	and they would say something so like racist
Je	JennIm	190.31	192.59	They would say things like Hey chink do you wanna
Je	JennIm	192.59	193.423	do my homework
Je	JennIm	193.423	196.939	or Hey you dropped your calculator and now
Je	JennIm	196.939	201.09	I wish that I had the strength to just clap back at them
Je	JennIm	201.09	203.4	because at the time I just didn't say anything
Je	JennIm	203.4	204.233	I was so scared
Je	JennIm	204.233	206.81	I was I was genuinely afraid of my for I was afraid
Je	JennIm	206.81	210.63	for my life and I wish that I had the courage
Je	JennIm	210.63	220.58	to just like stand up to them and be like
Je	JennIm	220.58	223.4	but unfortunately I wasn't like that
Je	JennIm	223.4	225.58	I think this also crossed at the same path
Je	JennIm	225.58	229.024	when my parents made me go to Korean school on Saturday
Je	JennIm	229.024	232.81	and I was so pissed that they were making me and my brother
Je	JennIm	232.81	234.73	go to school an extra day
Je	JennIm	234.73	236.71	Like we already had Monday through Friday
Je	JennIm	236.71	239.36	and now they're adding like a whole new curriculum
Je	JennIm	239.36	242.66	for Saturday and like we also they also made us go
Je	JennIm	242.66	244.67	to church every Sunday so I felt like I had
Je	JennIm	244.67	246.44	no days off like ugh
Je	JennIm	246.44	249.2	So we had to go to Korean school and there was this
Je	JennIm	249.2	254.12	one instance with a teacher that just really stuck with me
Je	JennIm	254.12	257.52	She was telling us that when people ask us what our
Je	JennIm	257.52	261.21	ethnicity is we need to say that we are Korean-American
Je	JennIm	261.21	265.01	The Korean always has to be first and I remember being very
Je	JennIm	265.01	268.47	unsettled by it because I felt like in my heart that
Je	JennIm	268.47	271.29	I was American so I rose my hand and I told her my piece
Je	JennIm	271.29	277.16	and she said No you are always going to be Korean
Je	JennIm	277.16	284.85	And I just said like Why can't I just be American
Je	JennIm	284.85	287.89	I just felt like this big distance between my culture
Je	JennIm	287.89	290.96	and what I was brought into
Je	JennIm	290.96	293.88	I associated being Korean as a negative thing because
Je	JennIm	293.88	296.77	number one the bullying sucked and number two I would
Je	JennIm	296.77	299.43	see the way people would treat my parents
Je	JennIm	299.43	301.95	Like my parents didn't speak English very well
Je	JennIm	301.95	304.19	I would just see the way people would treat my parents
Je	JennIm	304.19	305.43	because of their accent
Je	JennIm	305.43	308.11	People lose their temper people get frustrated
Je	JennIm	308.11	310.88	people treat you like you're an idiot when you have
Je	JennIm	310.88	316.07	an accent and it just really frustrated me and my Mom
Je	JennIm	316.07	319.75	is already kind of a shy timid person and I think
Je	JennIm	319.75	322.193	when she was thrown into this world in America
Je	JennIm	322.193	326.01	as like a foreign person I think that
Je	JennIm	326.01	327.54	just made her reclusive even more
Je	JennIm	327.54	330.0	One stereotype that I absolutely struggled with growing up
Je	JennIm	330.0	332.43	was the model minority stereotype
Je	JennIm	332.43	335.256	The fact that all Asians are amazing at crunching numbers
Je	JennIm	335.256	337.93	and they're just really great academically blah blah blah
Je	JennIm	337.93	340.29	and I think from an outsider's perspective
Je	JennIm	340.29	342.75	people might think wow like that's actually a really
Je	JennIm	342.75	344.815	good stereotype like people just think you're really smart
Je	JennIm	344.815	348.52	but it puts a lot of pressure on you especially
Je	JennIm	348.52	350.81	when you are not academically smart
Je	JennIm	350.81	354.76	Like I growing up I tried my best to be a good student
Je	JennIm	354.76	358.1	Like I would literally spend hours and hours doing
Je	JennIm	358.1	360.15	my homework and all this stuff and it just
Je	JennIm	360.15	362.32	wouldn't register to me
Je	JennIm	362.32	366.29	Like I was always like a B minus C student like one time
Je	JennIm	366.29	369.53	I got a D and like in an Asian household like that
Je	JennIm	369.53	373.15	is unacceptable like my B minuses were such disappointments
Je	JennIm	373.15	375.57	to my parents and they would always compare me to like
Je	JennIm	375.57	378.31	other kids and because I wasn't the best student I felt
Je	JennIm	378.31	381.85	this distance between my Asian American peers that were
Je	JennIm	381.85	385.96	very studious so I just found like a new group of friends
Je	JennIm	385.96	388.38	Like friends that I can connect with artistically
Je	JennIm	388.38	390.79	and creatively and obviously like there was
Je	JennIm	390.79	393.18	Asian Americans there too but it was like a whole mix
Je	JennIm	393.18	395.3	and it was really cool like we would
Je	JennIm	395.3	397.89	you know burn CDs for each other we would go to shows
Je	JennIm	397.89	401.56	we'd go thrifting and I felt really blessed that I was able
Je	JennIm	401.56	403.41	to have my own community in high school
Je	JennIm	403.41	404.91	Yes I can speak Korean
Je	JennIm	404.91	407.77	I would probably say I speak the equivalent of like
Je	JennIm	407.77	410.258	a seven year old maybe a six year old now
Je	JennIm	410.258	412.75	Like I know how to get by
Je	JennIm	412.75	415.31	I know you know how to ask for directions order food
Je	JennIm	415.31	418.85	have like light conversation but anything with depth
Je	JennIm	418.85	420.9	I'm just like ugh like I don't know
Je	JennIm	420.9	424.14	When I watch the Korean news I'm just kinda like
Je	JennIm	424.14	425.0	I don't know what they're saying
Je	JennIm	425.0	426.57	They have to talk a lot slower
Je	JennIm	426.57	428.44	It was a lot better when I was living with my parents
Je	JennIm	428.44	430.96	obviously like I speak Conglish with my parents
Je	JennIm	430.96	433.61	so I'll speak Korean and then I'll just fill
Je	JennIm	433.61	436.31	in English words where I don't know the Korean words
Je	JennIm	436.31	438.19	I just don't understand like where did all those years
Je	JennIm	438.19	441.02	of Korean school go like did I just bury them in a box
Je	JennIm	441.02	443.55	Like it's I don't know but I want
Je	JennIm	443.55	445.642	to change this desperately and so I'm just gonna do
Je	JennIm	445.642	447.35	like an open call now
Je	JennIm	447.35	449.981	I'm looking for a Korean tutor if you are based
Je	JennIm	449.981	452.42	in the Los Angeles area I would love for you
Je	JennIm	452.42	455.16	to DM me on my Instagram it's IMJENNIM
Je	JennIm	455.16	458.226	I guess you just tell me your name your age
Je	JennIm	458.226	461.5	what school you go to or if you did and just like
Je	JennIm	461.5	464.39	what kind of program would you put me on for ya know
Je	JennIm	464.39	466.237	my Korean tutoring session
Je	JennIm	466.237	469.6	Being Korean-American absolutely affected my relationship
Je	JennIm	469.6	470.56	with my parents
Je	JennIm	470.56	475.14	There was a lot of frustration and anger because
Je	JennIm	475.14	477.94	of all the miscommunication that would happen
Je	JennIm	477.94	479.41	There were so many times where I would just try
Je	JennIm	479.41	481.82	to talk to my parents but there are just words
Je	JennIm	481.82	485.8	that I just didn't know and vice versa and we would
Je	JennIm	485.8	487.0	just have yelling matches
Je	JennIm	487.0	490.18	I would scream at them being like
Je	JennIm	490.18	493.49	and they would just say like Why don't you know Korean
Je	JennIm	493.49	497.24	And so it always felt like this battle and growing up
Je	JennIm	497.24	500.27	my entire life I felt this huge disconnect
Je	JennIm	500.27	504.45	from my brain and my mouth like I felt like I couldn't
Je	JennIm	504.45	507.31	say exactly what I was feeling or I couldn't articulate
Je	JennIm	507.31	510.21	and put into words so writing was a nightmare for me
Je	JennIm	510.21	512.14	I hated writing because I would just look at the paper
Je	JennIm	512.14	514.29	and be like I just don't know what to say
Je	JennIm	514.29	517.41	I don't know like maybe was it because I was juggling
Je	JennIm	517.41	518.92	two languages like I don't know
Je	JennIm	518.92	520.92	I mean but I just look at other people and I see like
Je	JennIm	520.92	522.97	you grew up with like four languages and you're fine
Je	JennIm	522.97	524.77	so I don't know maybe it's just like a personal thing
Je	JennIm	524.77	527.11	but I've always had trouble communicating and so
Je	JennIm	527.11	529.57	with my parents with that language barrier it was just
Je	JennIm	529.57	533.47	like an extra level of just ugh just fogginess
Je	JennIm	533.47	535.84	and I just I was just very angry growing up
Je	JennIm	535.84	538.74	and I feel really bad for my parents because
Je	JennIm	538.74	541.41	when I was a teenager I was not I mean I was
Je	JennIm	541.41	544.27	kind of a nightmare so now I wanna chat
Je	JennIm	544.27	546.68	about the power dynamics because I feel like
Je	JennIm	546.68	549.15	that was kind of off with my parents because when we were
Je	JennIm	549.15	551.66	at home obviously my parents were in charge so we'd listen
Je	JennIm	551.66	555.97	to them but when we were out and about we would always
Je	JennIm	555.97	558.896	be translating and speaking especially for my Mom
Je	JennIm	558.896	563.274	and it's because my Mom is a very shy and fearful person
Je	JennIm	563.274	567.162	and I don't know if she was always this way because I
Je	JennIm	567.162	570.7	didn't know her when she was younger but I think it's
Je	JennIm	570.7	575.33	because of the judgment that people would give because
Je	JennIm	575.33	576.56	something really traumatic happened
Je	JennIm	576.56	580.47	to her while she was out here so
Je	JennIm	580.47	583.643	So when I was in preschool
Je	JennIm	583.643	586.52	I remembered my Dad picked me
Je	JennIm	586.52	590.39	up from school and I knew something was wrong
Je	JennIm	590.39	593.17	because normally my Mom picks me up from school so we
Je	JennIm	593.17	598.81	go home and I go to my parents' room and I see my Mom
Je	JennIm	598.81	601.33	just lying on the bed with a towel on her face
Je	JennIm	601.33	604.67	and so I asked my Dad like Is everything okay
Je	JennIm	604.67	607.67	and he says Oh she's just napping
Je	JennIm	607.67	612.17	We found out later that someone had robbed the store
Je	JennIm	612.17	614.57	My parents had a really small shop that sold
Je	JennIm	614.57	619.623	women's clothes in El Monte and someone had a knife
Je	JennIm	619.623	622.72	and he told her to give her the money in the register
Je	JennIm	622.72	627.37	and my Mom refused because that was all the money
Je	JennIm	627.37	631.44	we had and so she said no
Je	JennIm	631.44	637.8	and he sliced her face and of course he took the money
Je	JennIm	637.8	641.65	and she was a very fearful fearful person after that
Je	JennIm	641.65	646.99	She never spoke and I think it took her a very long time
Je	JennIm	646.99	650.0	to recover from that and when she told me that story
Je	JennIm	650.0	655.08	again when I was older it just it just lit a fire
Je	JennIm	655.08	659.89	in me like I because I
Je	JennIm	659.89	663.55	never want my parents to be in a situation like
Je	JennIm	663.55	665.54	that ever again and the reason why
Je	JennIm	665.54	669.09	I'm telling you this story is because I feel like
Je	JennIm	669.09	674.3	first-generation parents they have to do the shitty jobs
Je	JennIm	674.3	676.93	They have to work in the dangerous locations
Je	JennIm	676.93	681.12	The have to work at the salon the convenience stores
Je	JennIm	681.12	684.33	and they do this because they want to give us a better life
Je	JennIm	684.33	689.46	and so it makes me want to try so hard and to be able
Je	JennIm	689.46	691.71	to provide for them and so that they never have
Je	JennIm	691.71	693.52	to worry about that again
Je	JennIm	693.52	696.153	Every day I'm so grateful that they chose to move here
Je	JennIm	696.153	698.95	to give me and my brother a better life to give all
Je	JennIm	698.95	702.76	of us a better life and whenever I'm feeling unmotivated
Je	JennIm	702.76	707.057	or I feel like I just can't do it I think of that
Je	JennIm	707.057	710.05	and it just snaps me right back up
Je	JennIm	710.05	713.302	and it just fuels me to push harder
Je	JennIm	713.302	717.46	I feel so proud to be Korean-American now
Je	JennIm	717.46	720.31	and it definitely took some time
Je	JennIm	720.31	722.28	I think it's because the older I got the more I just
Je	JennIm	722.28	725.77	had to accept myself and I started to embrace my heritage
Je	JennIm	725.77	728.72	when I was probably like a senior in high school
Je	JennIm	728.72	730.73	to a freshman in college
Je	JennIm	730.73	734.2	I think that's when I realized I can't change who I am
Je	JennIm	734.2	737.89	so I have to accept it and I really hope that people don't
Je	JennIm	737.89	742.75	judge me for wanting to distance myself from my culture
Je	JennIm	742.75	746.56	because I think it all came from a place of me just
Je	JennIm	746.56	749.293	really wanting to fit in and really wanting
Je	JennIm	749.293	751.44	for people to like me
Je	JennIm	751.44	755.41	I'm here now and I'm so freaking proud to be Korean-American
Je	JennIm	755.41	757.25	and I want to specify that I'm both
Je	JennIm	757.25	760.92	In America generally people just see me as an Asian
Je	JennIm	760.92	763.27	and when I go back to Korea or when people
Je	JennIm	763.27	765.18	or Asian Americans go back to their motherland
Je	JennIm	765.18	768.44	people categorize us as Americans so we
Je	JennIm	768.44	770.44	don't fully belong in either
Je	JennIm	770.44	774.58	We're in our own category and I'm not mad about that
Je	JennIm	774.58	778.4	I love the fact that I can have the best of both worlds
Je	JennIm	778.4	780.65	It's like the Hannah Montana song
Je	JennIm	780.65	782.82	My favorite thing about being Korean-American is the
Je	JennIm	782.82	785.67	resilience because I feel like Korea has gone through
Je	JennIm	785.67	789.87	so much from Imperialism to war and now the fact that we
