He	HeyRayLee	0.03	1.949	that's when I started getting a lot of
He	HeyRayLee	1.949	5.37	like a racial derogatory comments about
He	HeyRayLee	5.37	8.7	being Asian hey guys welcome back to my
He	HeyRayLee	8.7	12.0	channel I am ray Lee here on YouTube
He	HeyRayLee	12.0	14.009	if you guys are new to my channel hello
He	HeyRayLee	14.009	17.19	but today I'm so excited to record this
He	HeyRayLee	17.19	19.23	video because I'm going to be talking to
He	HeyRayLee	19.23	21.24	you guys about my experience growing up
He	HeyRayLee	21.24	23.97	as an Asian American in America I
He	HeyRayLee	23.97	25.98	stumbled across this video that Amy had
He	HeyRayLee	25.98	28.529	posted about growing up as a Korean
He	HeyRayLee	28.529	31.199	American she is back bad news on YouTube
He	HeyRayLee	31.199	33.18	I will link her video down below I think
He	HeyRayLee	33.18	36.3	this topic is very common as far as like
He	HeyRayLee	36.3	37.739	the struggles you know growing up
He	HeyRayLee	37.739	39.75	especially if you have parents who don't
He	HeyRayLee	39.75	40.739	speak English
He	HeyRayLee	40.739	42.629	who were immigrants and I could create
He	HeyRayLee	42.629	43.98	like a whole nother video about like
He	HeyRayLee	43.98	45.66	growing up with immigrant parents but
He	HeyRayLee	45.66	47.55	yeah so I just wanted to take the time
He	HeyRayLee	47.55	51.96	to share my story with you guys and Amy
He	HeyRayLee	51.96	53.969	had created a bunch of questions so
He	HeyRayLee	53.969	55.77	without further ado let's get started I
He	HeyRayLee	55.77	57.96	am a hundred percent Korean I actually
He	HeyRayLee	57.96	60.449	was born in Korea I was born in Kangnam
He	HeyRayLee	60.449	62.969	and I moved here when I was five years
He	HeyRayLee	62.969	65.58	old my sister was eight and both my parents
He	HeyRayLee	65.58	68.43	came out here as well so we actually
He	HeyRayLee	68.43	70.11	moved out here for my dad's work and I
He	HeyRayLee	70.11	71.61	believe we were supposed to go back
He	HeyRayLee	71.61	74.82	after three years and you know live back in
He	HeyRayLee	74.82	76.229	Korea but we actually ended up staying
He	HeyRayLee	76.229	78.93	out here and I actually didn't know how
He	HeyRayLee	78.93	81.45	to say anything in English I wasn't born
He	HeyRayLee	81.45	83.22	here and neither was my sisters so
He	HeyRayLee	83.22	86.549	technically like we're not the first
He	HeyRayLee	86.549	89.31	generation and my kids would be first
He	HeyRayLee	89.31	91.799	generation but since I moved here when I
He	HeyRayLee	91.799	93.81	was so young I consider myself being a
He	HeyRayLee	93.81	95.52	first generation so when my parents
He	HeyRayLee	95.52	98.25	decided to move to America we actually
He	HeyRayLee	98.25	101.369	moved to the San Gabriel Valley in
He	HeyRayLee	101.369	103.049	Southern California and if you guys
He	HeyRayLee	103.049	104.79	aren't familiar with that area there are
He	HeyRayLee	104.79	108.57	a ton of Asians granted I think when I
He	HeyRayLee	108.57	110.61	had moved there there weren't that many
He	HeyRayLee	110.61	112.95	Asian people I remember going into first
He	HeyRayLee	112.95	115.2	grade and there was one other Asian girl
He	HeyRayLee	115.2	117.0	in my class and I believe she was Korean
He	HeyRayLee	117.0	119.909	and so my teacher paired us up together
He	HeyRayLee	119.909	122.64	so that she can like help me through the
He	HeyRayLee	122.64	126.09	school and she was so mean like I
He	HeyRayLee	126.09	128.16	remember she would like make fun of me
He	HeyRayLee	128.16	129.33	because I didn't know how to do like the
He	HeyRayLee	129.33	130.89	monkey bars because like that's not a
He	HeyRayLee	130.89	133.2	thing in Korea I mean I don't
He	HeyRayLee	133.2	135.06	think it was I don't know and anyways I
He	HeyRayLee	135.06	138.84	don't think I had a lot of like bullying
He	HeyRayLee	138.84	141.72	because I was Asian even though I was
He	HeyRayLee	141.72	143.61	completely a minority at the time I
He	HeyRayLee	143.61	145.56	think progressively as a years went by
He	HeyRayLee	145.56	147.239	there were more and more Asians that
He	HeyRayLee	147.239	149.069	would attend my school but I do remember
He	HeyRayLee	149.069	150.69	in elementary school
He	HeyRayLee	150.69	152.85	like my grandmother because she also
He	HeyRayLee	152.85	154.8	moved out here to raise us for a little
He	HeyRayLee	154.8	157.62	bit so my grandmother made me Korean
He	HeyRayLee	157.62	160.47	sushi which is called kimbap and it's
He	HeyRayLee	160.47	162.54	freaking bomb but I remember like I
He	HeyRayLee	162.54	165.93	opened my lunch pail and at school and
He	HeyRayLee	165.93	167.61	everyone was like oh my gosh like what
He	HeyRayLee	167.61	168.81	are you eating like that looks
He	HeyRayLee	168.81	171.63	disgusting like all this stuff and so
He	HeyRayLee	171.63	173.67	similar to the show fresh off the boat
He	HeyRayLee	173.67	174.959	if you guys have watched that before
He	HeyRayLee	174.959	176.7	like there's an instance in there where
He	HeyRayLee	176.7	179.459	like the characters eating I think like
He	HeyRayLee	179.459	180.87	black bean noodles or something and then
He	HeyRayLee	180.87	182.22	like everyone's you know like he's
He	HeyRayLee	182.22	183.87	eating worms or like whatever and I
He	HeyRayLee	183.87	186.36	remember going back home and just being
He	HeyRayLee	186.36	189.15	super sad and essentially just like
He	HeyRayLee	189.15	191.04	telling my family that like I only
He	HeyRayLee	191.04	192.87	wanted like Lunchables because that was
He	HeyRayLee	192.87	194.819	like the cool thing I just remember like
He	HeyRayLee	194.819	197.1	food was just a big thing that like made
He	HeyRayLee	197.1	198.66	me feel really like embarrassed
He	HeyRayLee	198.66	200.7	embarrassed about being like Korean
He	HeyRayLee	200.7	202.709	because I also remember you know those
He	HeyRayLee	202.709	205.709	food drives that schools do so that you
He	HeyRayLee	205.709	207.48	could like donate the food during like
He	HeyRayLee	207.48	209.67	the holidays and stuff and I remember my
He	HeyRayLee	209.67	212.94	dad gave me this box of chocolate pie
He	HeyRayLee	212.94	214.89	with my favorite dessert and like I
He	HeyRayLee	214.89	216.359	still love it to this day but it's
He	HeyRayLee	216.359	218.1	basically a chocolate cake with like
He	HeyRayLee	218.1	219.81	marshmallow in the middle and it's just
He	HeyRayLee	219.81	221.07	delicious
He	HeyRayLee	221.07	223.14	and I remember my dad had given that to
He	HeyRayLee	223.14	225.239	me so that I could drop that off during
He	HeyRayLee	225.239	226.62	my food drive and I was so embarrassed
He	HeyRayLee	226.62	229.59	that like I wasn't coming to school with
He	HeyRayLee	229.59	232.109	a can of peas and a can of corn and Here
He	HeyRayLee	232.109	233.94	I am like walking around with like a box
He	HeyRayLee	233.94	239.22	of chocolate dropped my place and like
He	HeyRayLee	239.22	240.51	just dropping and like running back
He	HeyRayLee	240.51	242.459	because I didn't want people to see that
He	HeyRayLee	242.459	244.5	like I had dropped off it's like weird a
He	HeyRayLee	244.5	246.84	dessert but I will say like the biggest
He	HeyRayLee	246.84	249.269	time that I had like this huge Epiphany
He	HeyRayLee	249.269	251.4	of like oh my gosh I'm a minority was
He	HeyRayLee	251.4	253.829	when I went to college I went to college
He	HeyRayLee	253.829	256.639	in Illinois that was like the biggest
He	HeyRayLee	256.639	259.38	culture shock for me because that's when
He	HeyRayLee	259.38	262.979	I finally realized that I was Asian like
He	HeyRayLee	262.979	264.24	an Asian American
He	HeyRayLee	264.24	266.25	that's when I started getting a lot of
He	HeyRayLee	266.25	269.669	like a racial derogatory comments about
He	HeyRayLee	269.669	273.27	being Asian and it was like it wasn't
He	HeyRayLee	273.27	275.039	even like hurtful like it was just it
He	HeyRayLee	275.039	276.72	would just make me so mad that like
He	HeyRayLee	276.72	278.4	there are people out there who are so
He	HeyRayLee	278.4	281.4	ignorant and I remember like a friend of
He	HeyRayLee	281.4	283.13	mine actually came and visited from
He	HeyRayLee	283.13	285.509	California and we were just like walking
He	HeyRayLee	285.509	286.8	across the street and this was pretty
He	HeyRayLee	286.8	289.19	late and I was like when I think like
He	HeyRayLee	289.19	291.509	when the bars were closing or something
He	HeyRayLee	291.509	293.46	like that and I remember people yelling
He	HeyRayLee	293.46	296.009	like go back to your country like you
He	HeyRayLee	296.009	298.229	don't belong here and like sing like
He	HeyRayLee	298.229	300.3	ching chong whatever like all this stuff
He	HeyRayLee	300.3	302.16	and I was just like I cannot believe I
He	HeyRayLee	302.16	304.71	go to a school where like you know if I
He	HeyRayLee	304.71	306.72	saw these students at school they
He	HeyRayLee	306.72	308.07	probably wouldn't say anything but the
He	HeyRayLee	308.07	310.56	fact that they could hide behind and
He	HeyRayLee	310.56	312.449	they were actually in a car so you know
He	HeyRayLee	312.449	314.34	they could hide behind just like saying
He	HeyRayLee	314.34	315.87	that while they drive past you know
He	HeyRayLee	315.87	317.34	that's when I realized oh my gosh like I
He	HeyRayLee	317.34	319.83	I'm not white and I'm clearly but like I
He	HeyRayLee	319.83	322.199	am different by the time that I went to
He	HeyRayLee	322.199	323.909	high school my high school had a
He	HeyRayLee	323.909	326.52	thousand students in just my graduating
He	HeyRayLee	326.52	327.99	class so there was four thousand
He	HeyRayLee	327.99	330.24	students at my school and I want to say
He	HeyRayLee	330.24	334.409	like at least 70 percent were Asians so
He	HeyRayLee	334.409	337.74	I always felt like I belonged and I like
He	HeyRayLee	337.74	339.659	belong to as like an Asian I don't know
He	HeyRayLee	339.659	341.37	necessarily if I ever thought like oh my
He	HeyRayLee	341.37	344.039	gosh like Korean pride because um I
He	HeyRayLee	344.039	346.62	don't know I just never felt like any of
He	HeyRayLee	346.62	347.88	us we're like oh my gosh like Chinese
He	HeyRayLee	347.88	349.409	pride cream pride like Mexican pride or
He	HeyRayLee	349.409	350.43	anything like that we just kind of like
He	HeyRayLee	350.43	352.199	all got along really well I don't know
He	HeyRayLee	352.199	353.669	sometimes like I feel like I would be
He	HeyRayLee	353.669	356.25	embarrassed to talk in Korean in like a
He	HeyRayLee	356.25	359.159	public setting but as I've gotten older
He	HeyRayLee	359.159	360.81	like I just don't care and I'm proud to
He	HeyRayLee	360.81	362.849	be Korean so you know I'll talk to my
He	HeyRayLee	362.849	364.77	parents in Korean and anytime that I can
He	HeyRayLee	364.77	366.509	I try to because I don't want to lose
He	HeyRayLee	366.509	370.74	the fact that I am Korean one was that
He	HeyRayLee	370.74	374.88	obviously Asians are smart and I'm the
He	HeyRayLee	374.88	377.31	second child my older sister is the
He	HeyRayLee	377.31	378.63	brains of the family and I'm like
He	HeyRayLee	378.63	380.4	completely okay saying that my sister
He	HeyRayLee	380.4	381.96	went to an Ivy League school she was
He	HeyRayLee	381.96	384.389	sooo she was and is super super smart
He	HeyRayLee	384.389	386.88	she's a doctor like I definitely did not
He	HeyRayLee	386.88	389.13	take that route and I felt like that was
He	HeyRayLee	389.13	390.509	a little bit hard for me because I
He	HeyRayLee	390.509	392.099	remember in high school because there
He	HeyRayLee	392.099	393.99	were so many Asians at my school
He	HeyRayLee	393.99	396.04	everyone I felt like every
He	HeyRayLee	396.04	398.44	was so smart and I remember everyone
He	HeyRayLee	398.44	400.96	taking like AP courses and people were
He	HeyRayLee	400.96	403.03	applying to like UCLA I was like a back
He	HeyRayLee	403.03	405.43	up school which like I couldn't even get
He	HeyRayLee	405.43	408.52	into UCLA so to me I was just like oh my
He	HeyRayLee	408.52	410.59	gosh like these people are so freakin
He	HeyRayLee	410.59	413.47	smart and I always felt like even though
He	HeyRayLee	413.47	416.05	you know I did take AP classes and stuff
He	HeyRayLee	416.05	418.63	I wasn't like in the top tier of like
He	HeyRayLee	418.63	422.71	super brainiacs and I don't know like I
He	HeyRayLee	422.71	424.15	always wanted to like I always grow up
He	HeyRayLee	424.15	426.67	like wanting to take dance lessons so I
He	HeyRayLee	426.67	428.11	started like cheerleading when I was
He	HeyRayLee	428.11	430.18	like in the third grade I like attended
He	HeyRayLee	430.18	431.8	drill team I was in the drill team all
He	HeyRayLee	431.8	433.93	throughout middle school and I took
He	HeyRayLee	433.93	435.67	dance classes like throughout high
He	HeyRayLee	435.67	437.98	school and I just felt like I wasn't
He	HeyRayLee	437.98	440.5	like the stereotypical Asian I felt like
He	HeyRayLee	440.5	443.11	I was forced to take on these
He	HeyRayLee	443.11	445.51	stereotypes like for instance I play
He	HeyRayLee	445.51	447.61	piano growing up I played cello growing
He	HeyRayLee	447.61	450.1	up I think as I've grown older I
He	HeyRayLee	450.1	452.53	realized that like yes some of those
He	HeyRayLee	452.53	456.28	stereotypes are true but I don't have to
He	HeyRayLee	456.28	458.83	be a hundred percent of those like
He	HeyRayLee	458.83	461.59	stereotypes and it's okay to not feel
He	HeyRayLee	461.59	463.26	like you have to be like completely like
He	HeyRayLee	463.26	466.96	extremely smart and you know like before
He	HeyRayLee	466.96	468.7	like oh you're like super loud and
He	HeyRayLee	468.7	470.68	you're like very vocal it's like not
He	HeyRayLee	470.68	472.03	very Asian of you and it's like well
He	HeyRayLee	472.03	473.32	what does that even mean you know
He	HeyRayLee	473.32	477.1	so I think you know like I struggled
He	HeyRayLee	477.1	478.99	with it in the beginning like as a child
He	HeyRayLee	478.99	481.36	but as I've gotten older I just don't
He	HeyRayLee	481.36	483.22	care and honestly like some of those
He	HeyRayLee	483.22	485.53	stereotypes like I fit into I'm Asian
He	HeyRayLee	485.53	488.71	and I love to save money I don't like to
He	HeyRayLee	488.71	490.27	spend money on things that I don't have
He	HeyRayLee	490.27	493.33	to and you know if that's me being Asian
He	HeyRayLee	493.33	494.98	then so be it
He	HeyRayLee	494.98	497.47	I can't speak Korean but because I moved
He	HeyRayLee	497.47	500.29	here when I was five I have like the
He	HeyRayLee	500.29	502.57	capacity of like a five year old which
He	HeyRayLee	502.57	505.33	is really sad so I can talk to my
He	HeyRayLee	505.33	507.43	parents about just like basic things but
He	HeyRayLee	507.43	510.61	I can't talk to them about like politics
He	HeyRayLee	510.61	512.979	or things going around like in the news
He	HeyRayLee	512.979	514.479	and stuff so that's a little bit
He	HeyRayLee	514.479	516.55	frustrating my hopes is that when I have
He	HeyRayLee	516.55	518.65	a kid that they learn to speak Korean to
He	HeyRayLee	518.65	520.06	like I want my parents to speak Korean
He	HeyRayLee	520.06	521.68	to them I think it's just really really
He	HeyRayLee	521.68	524.47	important to keep my Korean culture
He	HeyRayLee	524.47	526.66	alive and so yeah
He	HeyRayLee	526.66	528.06	growing up with parents
He	HeyRayLee	528.06	532.07	who did not speak English very fluently
He	HeyRayLee	532.07	535.95	was such a struggle for me especially in
He	HeyRayLee	535.95	539.1	like my teens I felt like I could not
He	HeyRayLee	539.1	541.29	communicate with my parents at all I
He	HeyRayLee	541.29	543.66	wasn't like the best in my teens I think
He	HeyRayLee	543.66	547.14	I was just like a brat and I feel so for
He	HeyRayLee	547.14	549.6	my parents especially my dad because I
He	HeyRayLee	549.6	552.96	clashed with him so much like he and I
He	HeyRayLee	552.96	555.27	were so so different I think we didn't
He	HeyRayLee	555.27	556.86	have a lot of like common grounds I
He	HeyRayLee	556.86	558.75	think as a teen it's really hard for you
He	HeyRayLee	558.75	561.6	to like communicate in general and have
He	HeyRayLee	561.6	563.31	this like open dialogue with their
He	HeyRayLee	563.31	564.779	parents because you think like your
He	HeyRayLee	564.779	567.029	parents are like the biggest enemies so
He	HeyRayLee	567.029	568.589	that was just like really difficult for
He	HeyRayLee	568.589	570.27	me I remember like we used to yell at
He	HeyRayLee	570.27	572.52	each other and I felt like it was just
He	HeyRayLee	572.52	574.02	like never gonna go away
He	HeyRayLee	574.02	577.5	but honestly I think you know growing up
He	HeyRayLee	577.5	580.2	I I've learned to be a less of a brat
He	HeyRayLee	580.2	583.29	right and me just understand like where
He	HeyRayLee	583.29	584.79	my parents are coming from because at
He	HeyRayLee	584.79	586.32	the end of the day the reason why we
He	HeyRayLee	586.32	588.06	were like having these extreme matches
He	HeyRayLee	588.06	591.54	is because I clearly wasn't doing what
He	HeyRayLee	591.54	593.67	they wanted would be like the best for
He	HeyRayLee	593.67	595.53	me as I've gotten older I've gotten even
He	HeyRayLee	595.53	597.75	more and more closer to my dad and like
He	HeyRayLee	597.75	599.97	honestly I'm like a daddy's little girl
He	HeyRayLee	599.97	603.75	and it's I think it was a lot of
He	HeyRayLee	603.75	607.02	obviously like me learning that you know
He	HeyRayLee	607.02	609.69	my parents aren't there as like somebody
He	HeyRayLee	609.69	611.76	who's trying to make my life worse like
He	HeyRayLee	611.76	613.29	if anything like they're trying to make
He	HeyRayLee	613.29	614.85	my life way better than they you know
He	HeyRayLee	614.85	616.32	the experiences that they had growing up
He	HeyRayLee	616.32	620.43	I am so proud to be Korean and not even
He	HeyRayLee	620.43	622.53	Korean but just like Asian American I
He	HeyRayLee	622.53	624.42	lived in Illinois I went to school there
He	HeyRayLee	624.42	625.8	and then I actually lived in Minnesota
He	HeyRayLee	625.8	627.75	for a little bit and I also lived in DC
He	HeyRayLee	627.75	630.57	for a little bit and I think being in
He	HeyRayLee	630.57	633.93	the Midwest I was able to kind of like
He	HeyRayLee	633.93	636.29	educate other people about being
He	HeyRayLee	636.29	638.52	asian-american since I couldn't like
He	HeyRayLee	638.52	640.95	obviously like teach my friends you know
He	HeyRayLee	640.95	642.87	Korean I would try to like introduce
He	HeyRayLee	642.87	645.63	them to food because I think that's just
He	HeyRayLee	645.63	647.839	like eating is such a great way to
He	HeyRayLee	647.839	650.79	experience another culture there's so
He	HeyRayLee	650.79	652.44	much tradition and so much culture
He	HeyRayLee	652.44	655.05	behind food so we're trying to introduce
He	HeyRayLee	655.05	656.76	a lot of my friends who obviously
He	HeyRayLee	656.76	659.22	weren't familiar with like Asians with
He	HeyRayLee	659.22	660.63	food I feel like any time
He	HeyRayLee	660.63	663.12	I have like the chance to kind of just
He	HeyRayLee	663.12	665.46	open doors for other people to like
He	HeyRayLee	665.46	668.01	enjoy and like experience a different
He	HeyRayLee	668.01	671.19	side of like America then I do it
He	HeyRayLee	671.19	673.44	through food one of my favorite things
He	HeyRayLee	673.44	675.87	about being an Asian American and Korean
He	HeyRayLee	675.87	678.12	American is the fact that we're very
He	HeyRayLee	678.12	681.45	very family-oriented I think that my
He	HeyRayLee	681.45	682.98	parents were a little bit different in
He	HeyRayLee	682.98	686.7	the fact that a lot of Korean parents
He	HeyRayLee	686.7	689.67	don't say I love you to their kids or
He	HeyRayLee	689.67	691.05	don't only think like Asian parents
He	HeyRayLee	691.05	692.31	really saying I love you to their kids
He	HeyRayLee	692.31	694.88	it's not very common but my parents
He	HeyRayLee	694.88	696.93	literally would tell me that every
He	HeyRayLee	696.93	698.76	single day like to this day when I
He	HeyRayLee	698.76	701.1	talked to my parents or my sister on the
He	HeyRayLee	701.1	704.73	phone we always say I love you when I go
He	HeyRayLee	704.73	706.41	to bed I always say good night and I
He	HeyRayLee	706.41	708.39	love you to my dad that's not as common
He	HeyRayLee	708.39	711.21	but I think the family oriented part is
He	HeyRayLee	711.21	713.25	very very common because I grew up with
He	HeyRayLee	713.25	714.72	my grandmother and I had the chance to
He	HeyRayLee	714.72	716.22	grow up with my grandmother in the
He	HeyRayLee	716.22	719.07	Korean culture grandmothers take a
He	HeyRayLee	719.07	721.26	really big pride in raising their
He	HeyRayLee	721.26	724.05	grandkids so my grandmother and I like
He	HeyRayLee	724.05	726.72	she was my best friend and I'm so so
He	HeyRayLee	726.72	728.97	happy that that was like part of my my
He	HeyRayLee	728.97	730.8	childhood and another thing that I love
He	HeyRayLee	730.8	733.44	about being korean-american is the fact
He	HeyRayLee	733.44	735.9	that we really really appreciate our
He	HeyRayLee	735.9	737.97	elders from a very young age you're
He	HeyRayLee	737.97	739.89	taught to be very respectful of your
He	HeyRayLee	739.89	741.66	elders which I think could be like a pro
He	HeyRayLee	741.66	743.82	and a con because there's a lot of like
He	HeyRayLee	743.82	745.59	authority and stuff like that but just
He	HeyRayLee	745.59	746.82	like you know if you think of like the
He	HeyRayLee	746.82	749.58	good parts of it in Korean there's
He	HeyRayLee	749.58	751.44	actually different ways that you say
He	HeyRayLee	751.44	754.77	words if someone is like of your peer or
He	HeyRayLee	754.77	758.37	someone who is higher than you so and by
He	HeyRayLee	758.37	759.78	higher than you I mean like older than
He	HeyRayLee	759.78	762.84	you when you say the word like high or a
He	HeyRayLee	762.84	765.87	friend you say onion but when you say it
He	HeyRayLee	765.87	767.82	to an older person you say onion has hey
He	HeyRayLee	767.82	770.07	oh so there's like two different ways of
He	HeyRayLee	770.07	771.36	saying it and I think that's pretty
He	HeyRayLee	771.36	773.58	similar in Spanish too which is like you
He	HeyRayLee	773.58	775.14	said I think I don't know I could
He	HeyRayLee	775.14	776.85	totally be making that up I took Spanish
He	HeyRayLee	776.85	778.92	for like eight years in my life and I
He	HeyRayLee	778.92	780.59	don't think I remember like anything
He	HeyRayLee	780.59	783.27	lastly I know I talk about food a lot
He	HeyRayLee	783.27	785.52	but I think it's because that was a big
He	HeyRayLee	785.52	786.78	part of my childhood
He	HeyRayLee	786.78	789.65	from like traumatizing to you know
He	HeyRayLee	789.65	791.7	educating other people with food but
He	HeyRayLee	791.7	793.779	like honestly I love
He	HeyRayLee	793.779	795.939	I know this was a super long video but I
He	HeyRayLee	795.939	797.439	feel like it got super caught up talking
He	HeyRayLee	797.439	799.029	about my childhood and love hearing
He	HeyRayLee	799.029	801.129	about how people grow up because I think
He	HeyRayLee	801.129	802.93	it says a lot about like who you are
He	HeyRayLee	802.93	805.509	right now but anyways I hope you guys
He	HeyRayLee	805.509	806.92	like this video and if you did make sure
He	HeyRayLee	806.92	808.66	to give this video big thumbs up thank
He	HeyRayLee	808.66	809.98	you guys so much for watching I love you
He	HeyRayLee	809.98	811.509	guys so much and I'll talk to you guys
He	HeyRayLee	811.509	814.709	next time
