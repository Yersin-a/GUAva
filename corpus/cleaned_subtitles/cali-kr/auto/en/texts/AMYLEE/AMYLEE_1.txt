saying you don't see race is the most racist thing you can say paint color wine is being blind to the thousands of years of oppression so I'm sorry sister but I totally see race with Amy I'm your lovely host you guessed it Amy and today we are going to talk about growing up asian-american and right now I'm just finishing up my concealer because I already did my base and my brows so I can speed up the process a little bit but I wanted to make this a tag video just for fun because I know a lot of my Asian American content creator friends have expressed concern to me that they wanted to talk about this but just didn't really know how to and secondly if you guys want to do it I would love for you to answer these questions you don't have to do your makeup that's just my thing with the am with Amy I'm sitting down here drinking tea doing my makeup talking about some heavy ship sometimes but you don't have to do your makeup so I mean you can but it is a little bit hot I will say that also if I sound a little sick it is because I am on day eight of recovering from I think the flu so my nose is crazy I have my tea as I said so just bear with me korean-american born in Korea and I was born here in the states in California I'm from a city in the Los Angeles County the Greater Los Angeles County it's not LA itself but it's in the county and it's kind of on the border of LA and Orange County and it's called Cerritos and for those of you who are familiar with Cerritos it is very much so like Irvine it is predominantly Asian lots of good Asian food lots of boba spots but it's just a lot of Asian families and it's just a very aged in place but the city is neighboring it like Artesia Bellflower Norwalk are predominantly Latin or Hispanic communities and so I think growing up I never truly felt like a minority but the first time that I understood that I was different or I understand it there is a demarcation between you know me and the Latin kids or whatever was I remember in second grade I was probably eight years old and we were sitting on the classroom floor and there was a guy named Bobby who was Mexican I believe and he asked me straight up to my face he said Amy why are your eyes so [ __ ] and I was just like whatever you know he's just being mean and it kind of brushed it off but then then he proceeds to say that there's so kinky that I look horny and I was eight years old and I remember distinctly thinking like what is funny mean like my I look like I have horns on my face or like I look like a unicorn I was just so confused and I said what the heck is horny I was just like what do you mean and he was just like never mind he was like just she just just kind of laughed about that but I remember he would say that to me a lot he would always bully me from my eyes and growing up I did experience quite a lot of bullying from a lot of the Latin kids for my eyes but even for me that was my biggest aha moment that I was like oh wow my eyes do look different from them and I'm different from them and that is when that kind of all started as a concept I also really wanted to learn what horny was but I had to me is that happen so long ago when we were in second grade and I remember exactly his full name which I will not say and what do you look like and where we were and exactly how I felt and it just it's like crystal clear in my memory even though everything else from second grade is really not that clear so elementary school was pretty okay and I feel like I got bullied mainly for how remember what race they were so I really can't tell if they were Asian people also making vitami because Asian Club also made fun of me for my [ __ ] eyes which is so bizarre but anyways so middle school is definitely what I felt there were a lot more Hispanic people or Latin people and I would be believed for being Asian or for being too smart or why I always got A's on tests or whatever I kind of falling into that model minority myth but high school is when I finally went to Cerritos high school which is a school that was not on anywhere of the border of these neighboring cities and it was all Asian kids I remember going to the first day of school and I was like well there's so many people here that look like me and I've come to school and it'd just be like a group of Asian kids like smoking and listening to like fly like a g6 and it was just very I just felt like I was like in a Far East Movement music video I just so many Asian kids so who thought they were cool or nerdy ones whereas in middle school you know Asian kids were just like nerdy and one-dimensional in that sense because we were surrounded with other minorities but in high schools all Asian people and we had you know ancient nerds the cool Asians like in Mean Girls and the Asian jocks retired football team was Asian we had literally had no diversity in this school and so I think that was when I realized like oh my gosh I'm surrounded by so many people like me and Who I am as a person I think I've always been a very anti-establishment and meri I like to stray from the norm and I'm very I don't like conformity I don't like if everyone says to do this I'm always like why why why and so soon as I got into high school I noticed that a lot of like the cool Asians with popular kids were really into like R&B and hip-hop and they were amazing at dancing and choreography and our drill team or dance turtle team looks like so good they're always competing and I was just like okay that's what's cool but to me I want to be that way and so I think in my high school it is very normal uncool to be Asian because literally everyone is Asian and that is the norm and so I think I started to really reject my culture when I was in fifteen when I was 15 to like seventeen years old because I was just not I just didn't want to fit in with that crowd and so if everyone will listen to R&B and hip-hop I wanted to go listen to rock and like heavy metal and that's when I discovered I made it and Slayer Metallica and stuff like that and if everyone was wearing like this certain type of shoe like I would want to wear something completely different from that and so in high school I really started to reject my Asian culture I didn't even drink buh-buh-buh-buh it's like the hugest thing in cerritos like people go out to bubble spots at 200 am and that's like it's it's a good thing it's neck tivity and I remember and all throughout high school I only started liking boba until I met one of my best friend's Sharon who caught me addicted to boba but even then I just I just I just didn't want any part of it and I think a lot of that was because I just didn't want to be like everybody else I just really didn't want to identify with that and all my personality tests if you guys believe in like the myers-briggs like I'm an IAT Jay and if you believe in the zodiac with Aquarius and all of my personality tests always talk about how nonconformist I am I even won best dress in high school my senior year and I hated that I won it because I always felt well one I thought none of the electives were actually indicative of how that person actually was so the best dress was never really that best dress and like most most likely to succeed would never really be successful and - I hated that I was a popularity contest it was completely not backed on anything other than whether or not people knew you and liked you and stuff like that so I actually stayed home from that day when they announced and they crowned you put you up on stage to give you a sash and I think that's when I became way more in tune with myself and my politics and where I stand because that is definitely the last year that I strayed away from wanting to not be age if that makes sense I think that was when I was rejecting what I thought was too perceived as being Asian which was like listening to Far East Movement but it's hard to say that I wouldn't just simulate if I went to a predominately white school because I didn't go to a predominantly white school and I who's to say I would be here from the norm then because maybe I wouldn't want to fit in then I don't know so it's hard to say it but I just do know that my experience is very idiosyncratic to me because a lot of people I talk to don't have this experience is like literally my graduation when they sign up all the names it was like Pak Pak Pak Lee Lee Lee Kim Kim Kim Jun dejected changing changing changing changing for like hours and I was probably the funniest Lee that they said and when I tell that people they're like what the heck that's crazy so but I just do know that I perceived Asian being Asian American to be a certain way in high school because I was surrounded by that one type of image and so I wanted to veer from that one of them is the model minority myth and that type of stereotype because growing up for me it's we're all as Asians were expected to be good at math and to just be naturally naturally gifted in matters of school and academia and I am also the second child and so growing up I was never ever you know superbly brilliant as I'm sure a lot of you are not as well but I think being compared to my older brother I was always kind of seen as a lot less intellectual or smart and so I feel like I always grew up with this underdog mentality which then propelled me to stay after school ask for tutoring come before school and really really study the extra hour is like I would go crazy with no cards I literally had a color chart for color coding with my highlighters and that has always been the driving force as to why I worked so hard and it has nothing to do with me being Asian and being this model minority and being naturally gifted for me personally is because I was always told that I was not very smart growing up and always being compared to someone and so that drove me and my insecurities to not be that way and so the model minority just tells us that as Asians we are naturally good at math we are good at sciences and you know it has nothing to do with how hard we work and find that the model minority is so destructive for a lot of my asian-american friends who no matter how hard they study or no matter how hard they work they just cannot get the results that their parents want or that society deems that we should have it's like they work their ass off and still cannot get even you know a C on the test and I find that that's so detrimental because so many of us don't fit into that model minority I know so many of my friends who are not good at math and honestly I'm only good at math because I stayed before and after class to get tutored on it literally calculus I remember going in to school at like 500 am and then leaving at 500 pm because I just wanted to get tutored on calculus and I've always had a lot of extra help in the sense that I use Khan Academy and I asked the smartest kid in class to tutor me but that's not to say that I'm naturally gifted at all these things without trying I find that it's problematic because it really minimizes people's work ethic and the actual sweat and dedication they put into it as opposed to genetically being predisposed to being good math or schooled another one that I have a hard time grappling with is being this submissive trophy wife and I took a lot of classes of this on this at UCLA Asian American feminism specifically because it was very interesting to see the underpinnings of how Asian American women became this you know submissive trophy wife that's supposed to be sexually promiscuous and also really obedient all at the same time and it's really weird because when I date people outside of my race people will say bla bla bla worshippers so if I date you know like a white man let's say a white man worshipper or if I date someone black like oh you have jungle fever and I'm just I'm sure a lot of I mean all all races definitely have this being that whole so having that stereotype on you it kind of makes you where when you're dating outside of your race to know it to try and gauge whether or not someone has quote-unquote yellow fever are they asking me out because they have a fetish are they asking me out because they fetishized Asian women and what that entails and for me I have dated all races I know that I've showed one relationship here on YouTube and you guys probably think that's the only race that I date but I'm a very open-minded person I really truly date all races I feel like it's more of a for me it's more of a taste issue like do we have similar tastes and in whether that's a music or food or clothes do we have the same taste and taste is definitely all-inclusive as far as race but I'm here I'm not here say oh I don't see race I fly a day all races saying you don't see race is the most racist thing you can say being colorblind is being blind to the thousands of years of oppression and systematic incarceration so I'm sorry sister but I totally see race but for me dating wise it's just a tasting so anyways but yeah so just dealing with that is very interesting and I make it a point not to date people who specifically only date Asian women and that's just personal preference to me and also shows that they're not super open-minded like I am so there's a couple reasons why I don't date people who only date Asian women and I guess it is because I am a little bit marred from that stereotype actually I'm probably a lot more I speak like that of a four-year-old I can ask for directions I can't order food ask for more food ask where the bathroom is but I really can't have a huge conversation in Korean you guys have a bet my entire family now here on YouTube I have videos with my brother my mom and now my dad my last video was my dad picks my outfits which you guys can watch up here in the cards it's pretty funny so as you guys might have guessed but I have a very strong and close and positive relationship with both of my parents and I find that that's because one they're super open-minded for being korean-american parents and two they trust me there are definitely some cultural differences and sometimes politics that don't align but we both understand and recognize that as a cultural thing and you know creating politics are definitely not as progressive and I consider myself super super liberal I am very very liberal and I'm very open-minded and so hey I think the only thing that sucks about being Korean American is that because I don't speak my language very well I can never ever get to know my dad or really talk about where my family is from like my grandparents my great-grandparents and that really honestly breaks my heart and if there's any driving force to me learning my language it's so that I could one day sit down and talk to my dog about politics and philosophy because my mom speaks fluent English and so I'm super open with her about the cut we can talk about the economy we can talk about politics we can talk about philosophy we can talk about pretty much anything and I feel super close to her but was my dad it sucks because I can barely speak about you know what's going on with our current geopolitical climate and I think he's such as wise and smart and an intellectual guy that it really makes me sad that I can't talk to him because he's always reading the newspaper and he seems really really woke in layman's terms but I think that's the biggest thing about being korean-american and the language we're here is that it really hinders my relationship with both my dad and any one of my grandparents as of today I am 100 150 percent so proud to be korean-american even though I'm so for unity and dismantling of racial segregation I do believe that culture is such a beautiful thing and culture or something that should be celebrated and it's honestly what makes this world so beautiful and colorful and even if I wasn't Korean I would have if I was Nigerian I would have a Nigeria tattoo if I was Chinese I would have a Chinese tattoo I think culture is something and heritage is something that should be celebrated soon as I hit eighteen I really honed in on what it meant to be Korean American and towards the end of my college career I had a lot of extra classes to take for fun like a lot of units to just basically use up and I think my last corner it was I strategically made it out so that I could only take classes that I really want to so I took an art history class and then all the other ones on the first day it was like what it means to be Korean or asian-american and I took asian-american feminism it's a Korean history formation of Koreatown I think that was the class and then I also took an entire year of the Korean language and I still suck at it but I never went to class it says he know which in Korean means literally exert strength but it's something that Korean people say as far as you know like cheer up keep going like endure it like stay strong so you say he knit or white team fight team it's kind of the same thing and it's basically just saying how for me Korea if you learned about its culture and its politics and its historical background it has been divided by so many different other external forces and the fact that it still remains and is strong I'm just like Korean people are resilient and it's it's just not staying strong and it's a it's definitely paying homage a lot of omage to my Korean culture I will say that I do not listen to modern-day Korean music because I know a lot of people love kpop but honestly I don't really listen to even American pop let alone like other people's pop music but if there was like a Korean Stevie Nicks you know I would be down I mean any one of my friends I'm so proud of my culture because when I moved out into my own place here we are I could have lived anywhere in LA any neighborhood in LA because it was my jurisdiction and of all the places I chose to live in Korea town I live in Koreatown and so many of my friends are like Amy's the ambassador of Koreatown she literally knows every plot every place every pot every sways every spot every place in Koreatown definitely love Koreatown and I think the reason why I love Korea tells so much I remember even at UCLA I used to drive all the way out from Westwood to Koreatown which is almost like a 40-minute drive with traffic if you guys have been to LA Koreatown is still very Korean it has so many mom-and-pop shops and pulling the walls but it's also in the process of being very gentrified there are so many new high-rise apartment buildings luxury apartment buildings and there are so many hot spots for going out so many cool bars and so many hipster little cafes shops if you want an Instagram Abul cafe place Koreatown is chock-full of them and so I feel like it's the perfect amalgamation of being Korean and being American and so I feel like Koreatown is a very strong representation of Who I am it's like I still at my heart have very Korean aspects and at the foundation I am a Korean person but I had a pink gentrified no that's all but a little very traditional but still modern and progressive all at the same time honestly because I love food so much I'm probably just gonna say the food because I can enjoy a nice vegan bowl of kale and quinoa with hummus and couscous but I can also go down for some you know beef table or some bone marrow soup with oxtail and I love that I can enjoy two types of cuisines and really feel at home with both of them because I love food I love Korean food I love American food I love cheeseburgers on front drives I think it kale food I love it all I love it all so that is the end of the tag by the way I wanted to quickly
