that's when I started getting a lot of like a racial derogatory comments about being Asian hey guys welcome back to my channel I am ray Lee here on YouTube if you guys are new to my channel hello but today I'm so excited to record this video because I'm going to be talking to you guys about my experience growing up as an Asian American in America I stumbled across this video that Amy had posted about growing up as a Korean American she is back bad news on YouTube I will link her video down below I think this topic is very common as far as like the struggles you know growing up especially if you have parents who don't speak English who were immigrants and I could create like a whole nother video about like growing up with immigrant parents but yeah so I just wanted to take the time to share my story with you guys and Amy had created a bunch of questions so without further ado let's get started I am a hundred percent Korean I actually was born in Korea I was born in Kangnam and I moved here when I was five years old my sister was eight and both my parents came out here as well so we actually moved out here for my dad's work and I believe we were supposed to go back after three years and you know live back in Korea but we actually ended up staying out here and I actually didn't know how to say anything in English I wasn't born here and neither was my sisters so technically like we're not the first generation and my kids would be first generation but since I moved here when I was so young I consider myself being a first generation so when my parents decided to move to America we actually moved to the San Gabriel Valley in Southern California and if you guys aren't familiar with that area there are a ton of Asians granted I think when I had moved there there weren't that many Asian people I remember going into first grade and there was one other Asian girl in my class and I believe she was Korean and so my teacher paired us up together so that she can like help me through the school and she was so mean like I remember she would like make fun of me because I didn't know how to do like the monkey bars because like that's not a thing in Korea I mean I don't think it was I don't know and anyways I don't think I had a lot of like bullying because I was Asian even though I was completely a minority at the time I think progressively as a years went by there were more and more Asians that would attend my school but I do remember in elementary school like my grandmother because she also moved out here to raise us for a little bit so my grandmother made me Korean sushi which is called kimbap and it's freaking bomb but I remember like I opened my lunch pail and at school and everyone was like oh my gosh like what are you eating like that looks disgusting like all this stuff and so similar to the show fresh off the boat if you guys have watched that before like there's an instance in there where like the characters eating I think like black bean noodles or something and then like everyone's you know like he's eating worms or like whatever and I remember going back home and just being super sad and essentially just like telling my family that like I only wanted like Lunchables because that was like the cool thing I just remember like food was just a big thing that like made me feel really like embarrassed embarrassed about being like Korean because I also remember you know those food drives that schools do so that you could like donate the food during like the holidays and stuff and I remember my dad gave me this box of chocolate pie with my favorite dessert and like I still love it to this day but it's basically a chocolate cake with like marshmallow in the middle and it's just delicious and I remember my dad had given that to me so that I could drop that off during my food drive and I was so embarrassed that like I wasn't coming to school with a can of peas and a can of corn and Here I am like walking around with like a box of chocolate dropped my place and like just dropping and like running back because I didn't want people to see that like I had dropped off it's like weird a dessert but I will say like the biggest time that I had like this huge Epiphany of like oh my gosh I'm a minority was when I went to college I went to college in Illinois that was like the biggest culture shock for me because that's when I finally realized that I was Asian like an Asian American that's when I started getting a lot of like a racial derogatory comments about being Asian and it was like it wasn't even like hurtful like it was just it would just make me so mad that like there are people out there who are so ignorant and I remember like a friend of mine actually came and visited from California and we were just like walking across the street and this was pretty late and I was like when I think like when the bars were closing or something like that and I remember people yelling like go back to your country like you don't belong here and like sing like ching chong whatever like all this stuff and I was just like I cannot believe I go to a school where like you know if I saw these students at school they probably wouldn't say anything but the fact that they could hide behind and they were actually in a car so you know they could hide behind just like saying that while they drive past you know that's when I realized oh my gosh like I I'm not white and I'm clearly but like I am different by the time that I went to high school my high school had a thousand students in just my graduating class so there was four thousand students at my school and I want to say like at least 70 percent were Asians so I always felt like I belonged and I like belong to as like an Asian I don't know necessarily if I ever thought like oh my gosh like Korean pride because um I don't know I just never felt like any of us we're like oh my gosh like Chinese pride cream pride like Mexican pride or anything like that we just kind of like all got along really well I don't know sometimes like I feel like I would be embarrassed to talk in Korean in like a public setting but as I've gotten older like I just don't care and I'm proud to be Korean so you know I'll talk to my parents in Korean and anytime that I can I try to because I don't want to lose the fact that I am Korean one was that obviously Asians are smart and I'm the second child my older sister is the brains of the family and I'm like completely okay saying that my sister went to an Ivy League school she was sooo she was and is super super smart she's a doctor like I definitely did not take that route and I felt like that was a little bit hard for me because I remember in high school because there were so many Asians at my school everyone I felt like every was so smart and I remember everyone taking like AP courses and people were applying to like UCLA I was like a back up school which like I couldn't even get into UCLA so to me I was just like oh my gosh like these people are so freakin smart and I always felt like even though you know I did take AP classes and stuff I wasn't like in the top tier of like super brainiacs and I don't know like I always wanted to like I always grow up like wanting to take dance lessons so I started like cheerleading when I was like in the third grade I like attended drill team I was in the drill team all throughout middle school and I took dance classes like throughout high school and I just felt like I wasn't like the stereotypical Asian I felt like I was forced to take on these stereotypes like for instance I play piano growing up I played cello growing up I think as I've grown older I realized that like yes some of those stereotypes are true but I don't have to be a hundred percent of those like stereotypes and it's okay to not feel like you have to be like completely like extremely smart and you know like before like oh you're like super loud and you're like very vocal it's like not very Asian of you and it's like well what does that even mean you know so I think you know like I struggled with it in the beginning like as a child but as I've gotten older I just don't care and honestly like some of those stereotypes like I fit into I'm Asian and I love to save money I don't like to spend money on things that I don't have to and you know if that's me being Asian then so be it I can't speak Korean but because I moved here when I was five I have like the capacity of like a five year old which is really sad so I can talk to my parents about just like basic things but I can't talk to them about like politics or things going around like in the news and stuff so that's a little bit frustrating my hopes is that when I have a kid that they learn to speak Korean to like I want my parents to speak Korean to them I think it's just really really important to keep my Korean culture alive and so yeah growing up with parents who did not speak English very fluently was such a struggle for me especially in like my teens I felt like I could not communicate with my parents at all I wasn't like the best in my teens I think I was just like a brat and I feel so for my parents especially my dad because I clashed with him so much like he and I were so so different I think we didn't have a lot of like common grounds I think as a teen it's really hard for you to like communicate in general and have this like open dialogue with their parents because you think like your parents are like the biggest enemies so that was just like really difficult for me I remember like we used to yell at each other and I felt like it was just like never gonna go away but honestly I think you know growing up I I've learned to be a less of a brat right and me just understand like where my parents are coming from because at the end of the day the reason why we were like having these extreme matches is because I clearly wasn't doing what they wanted would be like the best for me as I've gotten older I've gotten even more and more closer to my dad and like honestly I'm like a daddy's little girl and it's I think it was a lot of obviously like me learning that you know my parents aren't there as like somebody who's trying to make my life worse like if anything like they're trying to make my life way better than they you know the experiences that they had growing up I am so proud to be Korean and not even Korean but just like Asian American I lived in Illinois I went to school there and then I actually lived in Minnesota for a little bit and I also lived in DC for a little bit and I think being in the Midwest I was able to kind of like educate other people about being asian-american since I couldn't like obviously like teach my friends you know Korean I would try to like introduce them to food because I think that's just like eating is such a great way to experience another culture there's so much tradition and so much culture behind food so we're trying to introduce a lot of my friends who obviously weren't familiar with like Asians with food I feel like any time I have like the chance to kind of just open doors for other people to like enjoy and like experience a different side of like America then I do it through food one of my favorite things about being an Asian American and Korean American is the fact that we're very very family-oriented I think that my parents were a little bit different in the fact that a lot of Korean parents don't say I love you to their kids or don't only think like Asian parents really saying I love you to their kids it's not very common but my parents literally would tell me that every single day like to this day when I talked to my parents or my sister on the phone we always say I love you when I go to bed I always say good night and I love you to my dad that's not as common but I think the family oriented part is very very common because I grew up with my grandmother and I had the chance to grow up with my grandmother in the Korean culture grandmothers take a really big pride in raising their grandkids so my grandmother and I like she was my best friend and I'm so so happy that that was like part of my my childhood and another thing that I love about being korean-american is the fact that we really really appreciate our elders from a very young age you're taught to be very respectful of your elders which I think could be like a pro and a con because there's a lot of like authority and stuff like that but just like you know if you think of like the good parts of it in Korean there's actually different ways that you say words if someone is like of your peer or someone who is higher than you so and by higher than you I mean like older than you when you say the word like high or a friend you say onion but when you say it to an older person you say onion has hey oh so there's like two different ways of saying it and I think that's pretty similar in Spanish too which is like you said I think I don't know I could totally be making that up I took Spanish for like eight years in my life and I don't think I remember like anything lastly I know I talk about food a lot but I think it's because that was a big part of my childhood from like traumatizing to you know educating other people with food but like honestly I love I know this was a super long video but I feel like it got super caught up talking about my childhood and love hearing about how people grow up because I think it says a lot about like who you are right now but anyways I hope you guys like this video and if you did make sure to give this video big thumbs up thank you guys so much for watching I love you guys so much and I'll talk to you guys next time
