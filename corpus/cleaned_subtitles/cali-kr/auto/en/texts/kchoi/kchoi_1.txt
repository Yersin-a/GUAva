hi I'm Kate Roy welcome back to my channel I know that it's been like three months since I've uploaded a video I've just been really busy with work but I finally had a free morning to film and I really miss filming and editing even when it's just like a sit down video today I thought that I would do the Asian American tag which I believe was started by Amy aka vagabond Hughes and I've actually wanted to do this type of video since I saw Wei Lee upload one called growing up Chinese American I will link both of the videos I just mentioned in the description box so I've had like a running note in my phone of just my thoughts on this topic but I thought instead I would just do the tag to help structure the video a little better so let's just begin which ethnicity are you I am Korean I've actually gotten comments of people who didn't know that I was Korean which I thought was weird like I thought Choi was mostly a Korean last name but yeah Korean which generation are you I am second generation so my dad moved to the US when he was eight so he's actually pretty Americanized or he's just completely Americanized I've heard that being called one point five generation because even though he is a first generation immigrant he pretty much acts like he was born here because he came here when he was so young so my dad moved when he was young he's like one point five generation my mom moved after college after my dad and my mom got married so she is first-generation a first-generation immigrant and I am second generation what is the first experience where you felt different I think it was pretty early on because my elementary school didn't have a lot of Koreans let alone Asians I can remember maybe two other Asians in my school in elementary school two of my closest friends one of them had blond hair and blue eyes and the other one had like light brown hair and hazel eyes and I was always really jealous that they had such beautiful pretty eye colors and I think one of the earliest memories I have a feeling different is being in the bathroom together because girls go to the bathroom together and we were washing her hands and I remember looking in the mirror that was above the sinks and just not wanting to look at my face and if that sounds really dramatic and sad when I say it that way but it was just I saw how big and pretty their eyes were and how like slim their faces were as you probably know Asians typically have flatter faces with a lower nose bridge and with monolids instead of double eyelids or an eyelid crease so just seeing the difference in our faces I was really uncomfortable and just didn't want to look at that I wouldn't say that was an ongoing struggle but it was something that I would be reminded of here and there and be like oh right I look different than most of my friends were you always proud of your heritage or was there a time when you rejected it I wouldn't say I've ever rejected my heritage there were definitely times when I was embarrassed by it one time in elementary school I think like my mom was picking me up from school and so I was like coming out the gate and she like wasn't noticing me and so I was gonna call out to her but I was embarrassed to say oma because everyone else they say mom mommy and um just sounds weird and foreign so I remember not feeling very proud in that moment I was also always self-conscious of my middle name because my middle name is my Korean name and my friends in school their middle names were like Kimberly and Erin and mine was weird so that was also something that I was really aware of and embarrassed by and I just wanted a normal middle name what are some stereotypes that you struggle with I think the only stereotype I struggle with right now is that Asian women are bad drivers whenever I make any sort of mistake I just feel like oh god I hope they don't see me and then you know I'm just adding to this stereotype of Asian women being bad drivers so that is something I always thinking about when I'm driving I've had a couple times recently where I was talking to somebody for the first time and they commented on how good my English was so I guess there's that stereotype still of Asians all being foreigners so that's something that I don't struggle with on a day-to-day basis but it does pop up here and there can you speak your language Kumar sees Anita orders a toy or mother hungry okay Tanya so cool yo society hibachi unconscious Harrison edik Rizzo hands on Sheba's Agumon mani sokyoku um Parma Gannon Hondo castle where many take a Yaqui Locker - Seungyeon sir tell Sunita how has being asian-american affected your relationship with your parents I know a lot of people my age who have parents that immigrated to the us together they often struggle with a language barrier I feel very fortunate that I don't struggle with that as much I definitely don't struggle with that with my dad my mom is you know there's a bit of a barrier there but it's still like she's lived in the States for quite a long time and also because my friends in elementary school weren't Asian so my mom's friends who are my friend's moms they also weren't Asian so it's been you know a long time of her coming out of that comfort zone speaking Korean I think just on my end as I grow older I feel much more grateful for the struggles that my parents have been through in order to to raise me and give me a good life with a good education and a great family environment so I think that's something just like on my end it has affected my relationship with my parents in terms of me being more grateful as I grow older and realized that more and more and that's not just for Asian Americans I think that goes for all people who have parents that are immigrants there's that level of gratitude that you you know you build as you grow older how do you feel about your heritage now and do you identify with it I talked about how at my elementary school there were only like two other Asians my school but by the time I got to middle school in high school there were Koreans and Asians everywhere and I started to feel much more comfortable and in college I was really involved in my church fellowship and it was pretty much all Korean so I was I went from like when I was younger like not being surrounded by any Asians to just completely being surrounded by Asians and mostly Koreans there are times when I'm self-conscious of that and I'm aware of my friend group being mostly people who look like me and have a similar background when I am with friends who aren't Korean or Asian I am very proud of my heritage and I do try to bring it out and I teach them about it I would say that now I've come to a place where I am proud of it there are times when I'm self-conscious that most of my friends are Korean and I want to branch out more but overall I'm very proud that wasn't the question it was do I identify with it and I do identify with it I think korean-american is like a specific community compared to Korean and the American and I do strongly identify with that korean-american part of me of taking things from both sides what is your favorite thing about being asian-american basically what I just said of how I can take aspects from my Korean culture and then from the American culture which is already like a mishmash of a bunch of cultures and have that be my identity I love that I can speak Korean I love Korean food I love visiting Korea and slowly learning more about Korea's history because admittedly I don't know too much about it but just knowing the resilience of my people or the peat my ancestors is amazing and I love that I'm American too and that I can claim that as my identity and I love specifically like being from Los Angeles and the culture that comes with that so my favorite thing would be all the things just being able to combine all of that and that is what being American is really and being asian-american that's it for this video I hope you enjoyed and I hope thought you could relate to some of the things that I was saying let me know in the comments below if you did and I don't know answer answer the questions in the tag yourself -
