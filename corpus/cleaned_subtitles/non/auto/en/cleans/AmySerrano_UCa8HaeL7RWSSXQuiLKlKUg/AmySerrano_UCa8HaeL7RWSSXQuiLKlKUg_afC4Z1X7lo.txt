161.09	163.19	was super young I wanted to be a taxi
163.19	165.56	driver or sawgrass Paulo which is like a
165.56	167.57	snow cone in Panama because I would see
167.57	170.33	them collect cash money like directly
170.33	172.19	into their hands and I just I wanted
172.19	174.35	that money in my hands right my absolute
174.35	176.3	favorite show is Shark Tank I don't like
176.3	178.22	being around super negative people I
178.22	180.62	think because I'm so aware of it it just
180.62	182.45	bugs the crap out of me like if they're
182.45	185.959	just constantly like no don't come
185.959	188.12	around me with that um just makes me
188.12	190.34	kind of sad for those types of people to
190.34	192.8	be honest I have a super super super
192.8	194.66	addictive personality when I get into
194.66	196.25	something I need to know every little
196.25	199.16	single detail about it a little bit I'm
199.16	201.73	a little crazy in that sense I love iced
201.73	204.709	Americanos like just straight up black
204.709	206.48	but if I have hot coffee I need to have
206.48	207.98	like a little bit of almond milk and
207.98	210.62	cinnamon I have a mega girl crush on
210.62	213.65	Mila Kunis I'm deathly afraid to hold
213.65	215.81	newborns I don't know how to hold a baby
215.81	217.64	you know from here like oh he's so cute
217.64	220.34	he's so cute but do not pass him over to
220.34	222.95	me because I am like this paralyzed like
222.95	225.62	I won't move I'm so scared to hold a
225.62	226.94	baby I don't know if you guys can
226.94	229.1	already tell but I am very animated with
229.1	231.769	my facial expression so I'm like when
231.769	233.33	I'm surprised on the rise like you know
233.33	235.34	when I'm mad like you can just see it on
235.34	237.5	my face I'm very easy to read I love
237.5	239.51	love love spicy food I know this might
239.51	241.34	sound a little weird but when my lips
241.34	242.959	are burning after eating something
242.959	244.39	that's like a good
244.39	246.43	for me I love it and my favorite chili
246.43	248.29	is habanero it hurts me when I see
248.29	250.69	people yell at anybody in like a service
250.69	252.31	type of industry I hate it
252.31	255.52	it irks me so so much I love traveling
255.52	257.14	the ultimate trip for me would
257.14	258.609	definitely be Tokyo I just love
258.609	261.519	everything about that culture and love
261.519	264.34	Tokyo I love Japan I really really want
264.34	265.75	to visit so hopefully this year I get to
265.75	266.23	go
266.23	267.76	my favorite trip that I have taken is
267.76	270.1	definitely a tie between Peru and Kenya
270.1	272.47	hands down my dream wardrobe would be
272.47	274.75	anything each sailor on I love each
274.75	276.76	sailor own I used to be made fun of for
276.76	278.98	being super flat chested but I actually
278.98	281.14	really love small boobs so I never
281.14	284.08	really cared I have the biggest biggest
284.08	286.51	crush on Aziz Ansari it's not like your
286.51	289.54	conventional crush but I have a crush on
289.54	290.62	Aziz Ansari I do
290.62	293.29	I like candles and incense every single
293.29	295.78	day like people who come visit me well
295.78	297.25	it's not like a lot of people but like
297.25	299.2	when my mom comes and visits me visits
299.2	301.12	me she's like oh my gosh Amy how could
301.12	303.34	you be with all these incense and but I
303.34	305.74	it just makes me so happy I love I love
305.74	308.32	love love incense and candles Lewis was
308.32	310.21	the movie that really got me into
310.21	312.28	fashion I think like I mean I was super
312.28	314.38	young when I saw it but I was like oh my
314.38	316.57	god like the way they match up the
316.57	318.31	clothes with the revolt of closet oh my
318.31	320.53	gosh I got a ride I don't know I love
320.53	322.72	fashion after that I used to never cry
322.72	324.7	for anything like nothing nothing would
324.7	326.68	make me cry nothing sad would make me
326.68	329.169	cry and now I cry for anything and
329.169	331.06	everything oh my gosh if somebody got a
331.06	333.07	deal on shark tank I'm crying but I
333.07	335.26	mainly cry if it's something like happy
335.26	339.16	thank you birth control made me crazy I
339.16	341.11	love watching documentaries Anthony
341.11	343.9	Bourdain is my hero my number one hero I
343.9	346.69	can put avocado on everything and
346.69	348.64	anything if it's like a weird mix like
348.64	350.14	if it's desert or something like that my
350.14	352.15	theory is if I can't put avocado on it I
352.15	353.32	can probably put peanut butter on it
353.32	356.32	love peanut butter love avocado I read a
356.32	358.63	ton of nonfiction but my favorite book
358.63	361.36	of all time is the outsiders the only
361.36	363.31	book I really read more than once love
363.31	365.5	love love the outsiders I am obsessed
365.5	367.33	with hanging out with my cousins I have
367.33	368.8	so many cousins and
368.8	371.349	all best friends from eighteen year old all
371.349	373.69	the way to forty years old like we all hang
373.69	375.759	out and it's amazing I wouldn't change
375.759	378.879	my family for the world I love them to
378.879	381.009	pieces I am a huge believer in dream
381.009	383.11	boards I do one every single year so I'm

386.02	388.629	have an obsession with clouds oh they're
388.629	390.129	just so beautiful I thought I wanted to
390.129	391.69	be a meteorologist actually when I was
391.69	393.039	younger when I used to work with Katy
393.039	394.539	Perry years back she used to call me
394.539	396.31	Little Miss Perfect I am a super
396.31	397.81	perfectionist especially when it comes
397.81	399.97	to work I prefer the beach over the pool
399.97	402.28	I love love love traveling but every
402.28	404.229	time on the return flight landing into
404.229	406.87	LAX I have like these butterflies I
406.87	408.19	don't know I have like a love affair
408.19	410.289	with LA hocus pocus is one of my
410.289	412.03	favorite movies of all time because it
412.03	413.949	reminds me so much of my sister we used
413.949	415.539	to reenact the entire movie and I can
415.539	418.659	still quote it like verbatim I'm pretty
418.659	420.099	adventurous when it comes to food but I
420.099	423.25	can't do anything slimy like a little up
423.25	426.039	I consider myself to be a son child I
426.039	427.659	just feel super connected to the Sun I
427.659	430.03	am so not a gym person I hate going to
430.03	432.49	an enclosed space I'd rather go for a
432.49	435.19	hike or do Zumba the music just makes me
435.19	435.849	feel alive
435.849	437.62	I went to a small Catholic High School
437.62	439.9	and we had to wear uniform that guy's
439.9	442.449	like I have to go to a small Catholic
442.449	444.52	High School and headwear uniform every
444.52	446.139	day and I actually came to really really
446.139	448.06	love it I love love love mangoes and I
448.06	449.529	would probably eat them more if I knew
449.529	451.69	how to peel and cut them I just I don't
451.69	453.279	know how to cut them I've YouTubed it
453.279	455.5	and I just can't seem to get it together
455.5	457.389	I used to think that I was gonna marry
457.389	460.659	Adam Brody from The OC Seth Cohen I used
460.659	461.979	to think I was gonna marry him I really
461.979	464.08	did when I saw that he married Lee
464.08	466.93	Leighton Meester my heart dropped I kid
466.93	469.599	you not my heart sank to my the bottom
469.599	472.24	of my stomach I'm addicted to vegan
472.24	474.55	peanut butter ice cream from Van Leeuwen
474.55	476.949	lewin I don't know how to say the
476.949	478.87	freaking place but I go there so much
478.87	481.12	and I am not even vegan I just I love
481.12	483.55	that ice cream song so much mary kate
483.55	486.43	and Ashley are definitely the twins that
486.43	488.86	inspired me to want to travel the world
488.86	491.05	all their straight to video movies
491.05	493.93	passport to Paris our lips are sealed
493.93	496.899	winning London all those movies made me
496.899	497.8	want to travel and I
497.8	499.12	thought I was gonna meet like a hot guy
499.12	502.259	everywhere I went so not the case
502.259	504.129	delusional delusional
504.129	506.56	I love reading but I get so excited for
506.56	508.629	new books so instead of finishing that
508.629	510.34	book then I'll start the no new book
510.34	511.69	because I'm so excited and then I'll
511.69	512.649	read a little bit and then I'll get a
512.649	514.419	new book and then so I have a lot of
514.419	516.25	unfinished books it's really bad I'm
516.25	517.87	trying to be better about that and
517.87	519.969	trying to finish the books that I start
519.969	523.06	I love linguistics I love language I
523.06	525.459	always wish I had better vocabulary I'm
525.459	527.47	obsessed with vocabulary when I was
527.47	529.0	younger I would write down all the new
529.0	530.56	words if I was reading a book or
530.56	532.269	listening to a song and I loved that
532.269	534.1	word I would write it down in this like
534.1	536.29	little journal that I made and define
536.29	538.45	them and try to use them in sentences I
538.45	542.14	was kind of a nerd I'm very like turned
542.14	543.76	on I don't know if turned on is the
543.76	547.24	right word but I really love people who
547.24	551.68	can speak eloquently I'm such a fan of
551.68	553.81	people who can speak eloquently that is
553.81	556.3	why I like Matt Lauer that is why I like
556.3	560.019	Colin coward I love listening to people
560.019	563.38	with I don't know good voices I hate my
563.38	565.72	voice I'm so lucky being my little voice
565.72	567.97	is so annoying I think that's how we all
567.97	569.47	are right everybody hates to hear the
569.47	571.3	sound of their own voice so those were
571.3	572.98	the fifty things about me I hope you guys
