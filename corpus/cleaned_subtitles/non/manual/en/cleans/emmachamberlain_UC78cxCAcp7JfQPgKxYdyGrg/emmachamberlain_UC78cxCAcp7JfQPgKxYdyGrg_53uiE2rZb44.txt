196.44	200.819	Lemon in water really good favorite holiday. I like Christmas
200.819	202.519	Because I'm basic
202.519	208.079	I mean like I don't know every other holiday just seems to be like not as awesome as Christmas the best vibes
208.079	213.449	The most like I don't know I slept that time of the year Christmas favorite Pastime I
213.449	218.22	Like I mean you know exercising taking that
218.22	221.759	editing videos filming videos taking more naps
221.759	226.62	So yeah, my main form of pastime is like doing videos right now and go to the gym
226.62	231.109	Favorite sport probably to my favorites I did competitive cheer which I think is a sport some people
231.109	234.829	You know don't come at me, but like I think cheers the sport when it's competitive
234.829	239.4	And so probably that or track because I did track
239.4	242.18	This year at school, and I really liked it. What is something?
242.18	243.949	You are talented at personally
243.949	250.409	I don't like this question because like I don't know like I don't really know if I'm talented at anything because like you're your own
250.409	253.59	Worst Critic so like I kind of think I suck at everything
253.59	258.38	But like that's kind of human nature so I don't know when I'm talented at honestly. I don't have an answer for that
258.38	262.159	What is something you wish you were talented at I mean I wish I was talented everything
262.159	265.27	I wish I was a good saying. I wish I was like a good dancer
265.27	268.42	I wish that I was I don't know I wish I was good at a lot of things
268.42	272.24	I wish I was like a really fast runner. I don't know I wish I was
272.24	275.15	talented that everything honestly are you competitive Ii
275.15	281.44	It like depends like I can be super competitive in certain situations where I just like need to win, but then other times
281.44	286.48	I'm like it. I don't really mind moving so it's like it's kind of in between describe yourself in a single sentence
286.48	290.23	Oh my God. This is getting really hard um. I don't I don't know how to like put it new sens
290.23	294.04	I think I'm like pretty hard working and like you know like if I get my head, okay
294.04	300.62	just mechanism it if I like get set on something like I will not stop till I like get that thing and
300.62	305.02	That's a sense about me. What is the best compliment you ever received?
305.02	309.29	I think whatever people say like I'm a really like nice person or my kind person or people say that to me
309.29	311.77	That's like probably the nicest compliment
311.77	316.97	I could get because it's something I like strive to do is like be a kind person and be nice or whatever
316.97	318.92	So when people say that I?
318.92	325.09	Succeed at that it really makes me super happy so probably that what are some of your bad habits
325.09	328.93	Probably like overthinking a lot. I definitely think about things like way too much
328.93	334.58	I overanalyze every single situation ever that's probably probably um favourite things about yourself
334.58	339.22	I would say is like what I said earlier how I like don't stop until I like succeed at whatever
339.22	340.94	I wanted to see that and
340.94	342.52	Obviously sometimes I don't succeed
342.52	347.45	But if I like reach the end or like I push myself to like the highest
347.45	353.56	Point that was like successful point. I can get to probably that what is on the top of your bucket list honestly
353.56	355.91	I don't really have like specific things on my bucket list
355.91	360.34	But I know for sure I want to I definitely want to travel more
360.34	362.23	I mean, that's like a really like cliche answer
362.23	368.41	But like go outside of the country or maybe go to like I don't know bali looks really cool kind of Wanna
368.41	375.19	Go there like just like really like unique places. Just like explore more you know three long-term goals honestly
375.19	376.48	I would just say like overall
376.48	379.22	I'm not even going to say three because I only have one just like
379.22	383.18	Wherever I'm at in my life at any point be like really
383.18	388.94	Happy and like just genuinely happy whether that means like whatever that means in the other
388.94	390.88	Aspects of my life like I don't care about that
390.88	397.579	I don't care what I end up doing is that except just overall being happy and also really cliche, but like
397.579	402.129	The truth three short-term global we're not that short-term that would probably mean today
402.129	408.979	And that would mean try to not take it off and then try to not drink more than three coffees within one hour
408.979	410.889	It's hard, and I don't know if I'm gonna succeed
410.889	414.349	But I think that I might be able to so I'll let you know
414.349	417.069	What are you doing today to accomplish those goals well?
417.069	422.859	I haven't done anything for either of those today taking a nap wise it is currently twelve PM
422.859	430.699	And I have not taken a nap yet. So we are going strong in that aspect the coffee thing. I already had two today, so
430.699	435.789	I'm not doing so well on that one, but I think I think if I really control myself
435.789	442.089	And I can wait another like twenty minutes. I might be able to only have one more coffee today. So we'll see
442.089	443.899	What is your biggest accomplishment?
443.899	451.249	becoming more confident and happy and summing that sexuality a big accomplishment although starting a YouTube channel because I always wanted to and
451.249	454.539	It was kind of an interesting story about how it happened, so one day
454.539	457.579	I will do a story time and tell you why I started youtube because it's actually really interesting
457.579	463.36	But I had a channel a long time ago like in like fourth grade, and I did like outfits on there
463.36	467.059	And it was like horrible, and I can't find those videos anymore
467.059	469.299	Luckily like literally, thank God. They were so embarrassing
469.299	475.149	But I'm probably also like starting a youtube again because I always wanted to and now I'm doing it. So that's cool
475.149	481.399	What didn't I feel first date for you? Okay? Well? I don't go on dates very often
481.399	482.689	Sadly
482.689	487.729	This is also kind of cliche. I don't like things like going to the movies. I don't like things like a dinner
487.729	491.829	Because I just like really boring to me like just so like awkward well with a movie
491.829	495.549	It's just awkward because you can't talk and it's just weird and then do you like went to dinner?
495.549	499.509	You're like Force like look at the other person in the face, and then they have to watch you eat
499.509	505.519	I don't know do something about that's just too boring um something like really fun like in adventure like
505.519	510.999	Driving somewhere kind of far away like driving to the beach or something like swimming in the ocean at like two AM
510.999	513.969	Or something okay? That's actually good. Not really fun something like that
513.969	519.769	It would be like really memorable and like special so what is something you look for in a partner
519.769	524.3	I'm sixteen and I have basically no experience in this topic
524.3	530.07	But I would say just like somebody who is like willing to put in people effort into the relationship
530.07	535.7	But also like somebody who you can trust in like the trust is mutual so like you're not worried about like where they are all
535.7	538.23	the time or who they're talking to or whatever like
538.23	543.71	Somebody like trust me enough that like I could like hang out with another guy friend and like the guy wouldn't care you know also
543.71	549.21	Just somebody who's like genuinely kind and like thoughtful of me and my feelings because I'm like emo
549.21	555.38	I'm kidding um but like yes, so he's like really like considers your feelings. I'm bad at this stuff. Who is your role model?
555.38	559.49	I would say like definitely my parents. I mean for sure like that's an obvious one
559.49	564.02	I was something like a really inspirational person is like Casey nice - a youtuber. He's a great person
564.02	566.28	I don't know. He's really inspirational to me which one of your parents
566.28	570.41	Are you more like depends like really similar to my dad because we like the same music
570.41	573.08	We like doing the same things he has a Youtube channel, too
573.08	574.29	We both like to like go
574.29	578.06	Like explore in the City and like you know I get coffee and stuff except
578.06	583.13	I think we have a lot of like I also think I'm aligned with my mom because you know we both like enjoy it sort
583.13	586.88	Of women parts of like life like shopping and like stuff like that
586.88	591.14	So it kind of depends which one of your parents are you closest to this is also kind of like
591.14	597.32	I don't have one or the other I'm close with both equally in like different ways because I'm an only child
597.32	600.74	Only children get really close with their parents so both honestly
600.74	606.92	What is the last book you read um I don't read like I genuinely do not read ever because I hate it
606.92	612.18	I don't know why I just don't like reading unless I find like a really really good book that I like really love I
612.18	617.28	Just don't read so I don't have an answer for that. What is your favorite fairy tale?
617.28	618.24	pfft
618.24	623.36	I don't freaking know like I ever like what what even is a fairy tale like I mean I know but like I know I don't
623.36	623.75	Have an answer
623.75	629.64	What is your favorite quote I hate reading quotes out loud like something about that is so corny to me
629.64	632.15	But let me look at my pinterest on my quote board
632.15	636.15	And I'll just read one that I find how the keep it simple good things are coming
636.15	642.14	That's a good one remember that kids keep doing that good mindset. You know favorite subject in school probably science
642.14	644.43	It's the most interesting to me
644.43	653.01	It's also one of the hardest classes in school for me, but I do enjoy science so probably that I like biology more than chemistry
653.01	655.11	definitely subject you were best at
655.11	660.36	Honestly like depends because like I don't think I'm very like it depends on like if you mean like which I personally think I
660.36	666.42	strive at or like which one has a better grade like that's just different, but like I think I'm
666.42	670.17	Okay, at like history and stuff like that, but I absolutely hate it
670.17	675.08	So it's like I dunno like I'm probably better at history and English, than I am at like math and science
675.08	677.34	But like I enjoy math and science more
677.34	682.16	Don't ask me why favorite teacher honestly? I don't have an answer
682.16	688.5	I liked all of my teachers in Elementary school and the second I got to high school
688.5	690.06	the relationships
690.06	692.34	Weren't as good in high school, and I'm still in high school
692.34	700.64	Yeah, it's just a lot more on the line a lot more tension. So that's that. Who has left the biggest impact on your life?
700.64	703.26	probably my parents because
703.26	704.97	They've always been there my whole entire life
704.97	710.87	So there's really nobody else in this entire universe who could have more of an impact on me than my parents because I've been around
710.87	714.26	Them my whole life, and I'm an only child and they're like the biggest influence on me
714.26	719.81	What app do you use most? Probably Instagram or Visco. What piece of technology could you not live without?
719.81	725.9	Honestly, I don't just have one. Phone, laptop very important, and camera also very important
725.9	731.27	But if for some reason I couldn't have a camera the phone as the camera so probably phoned and laptop. What countries
731.27	736.53	Have you visited well I've been out of the country twice. I went to Ireland and then I went to the Dominican Republic
736.53	739.25	What countries would you LIKE to visit? If it was up to me,
739.25	745.64	I would visit every country in the entire universe... so... Most embarrassing memory? Oh my God, okay
745.64	750.92	This is really good. So basically like I did cello in fifth grade um which is weird considering
750.92	756.68	I literally four foot six inches and probably weighed fifty pounds and was basically the size of a cello
756.68	757.76	But anyway
757.76	762.66	it was the end of the school year and we had like our last recital thing, parents were there
762.66	767.96	Grandparents were there uncles, aunts, everybody you can think of was there. The crowd was going
767.96	775.85	Wild when we finally finished our fifth grade orchestra performance and all of us sucked. We probably sounded like actual crap considering
775.85	777.57	we were literally fifth graders and
777.57	780.56	Barely had brains developed yet, just kidding that's not true
780.56	788.19	But you know what I mean um anyway, so obviously it at the end of the year they gave out awards for people who are really outstanding
788.19	792.96	So I was sitting there in my chair. You know I wasn't expecting to get an award
792.96	795.2	because well I
795.2	802.32	just didn't play like I literally move my fingers and just like lightly put my bow the bow I'll insert a
802.32	806.45	Bow across like the thing I wouldn't even make any noise with my actual cello
806.45	810.39	I would just kind of like fake it the whole time, so I wasn't really expecting
810.39	817.29	"An award because I really didn't deserve it basically I heard our conductor guy say like ""all"
817.29	821.69	"Of the people who play cello stand up."" That's why I heard in my brain, okay?"
821.69	828.38	"I don't know why I've heard this because that is not what he said he said ""blank name stand up"""
828.38	833.54	"I thought he said ""all the people who play cello stand up,"" but it turned out. He said like"
833.54	839.18	This cello player stand up, and it said her name, and then she stood up well, I stood up with her
839.18	841.2	But I didn't win the award tho
841.2	846.78	[Emma displays an uncomfortable amount of awkward silence as she remembers her sense of embarrasment that day]
846.78	853.65	Okay, moving on. How many relationships have you been in? haha ONE in Fifth grade
853.65	858.87	so but I mean I guess in you're sixteen you don't need to be in a relationship, so I guess it's fine, but I'm
858.87	861.41	No, I'm just kidding. I'm good. Single life is the best life, ya know?
861.41	867.96	If you could give your younger self any advice, what would it be? You will never regret being kind
867.96	872.94	one thing that you know now that you wish you would have known as a kid that's like the same question and
872.94	877.2	I'll say it again. You will never regret being kind
877.2	878.7	ever
878.7	880.17	Okay
880.17	885.54	Like I just remember how me and everybody was in Middle school to each other and it was just the norm you know
885.54	892.28	Second grade self girl would steal your sticker and talk about a freaking fight and like at this point in my life
892.28	898.31	I've learned you know just be the bigger person always be kind no matter what anybody says or does to you being kind you will
898.31	902.85	Never regret it okay. Tea, or coffee? Okay coffee. I'm sorry
902.85	906.24	That's just like not even a question. I don't even
906.24	910.14	Like that we don't even need to discuss it okay coffee
910.14	917.79	How tall are you I am five three and a half but I think I'm 5'4 now soooo I don't know. Cats or dogs? um
917.79	922.64	Dogs, I mean, I don't know I just like dogs better. Sorry. All you cat people, no hate
922.64	929.73	I have cats and dogs so like yeah, but dogs are just better. I feel like everybody who doesn't like dogs doesn't have one
929.73	937.2	So like that's the answer to that. Funniest moment throughout school? Honestly I feel like all moments in school are absolute hell
937.2	943.59	Rather than anything funny. I usually am not laughing during school, I'm usually crying
943.59	949.7	Hysterically constantly because of how much I actually despise being there if I think of one later, I'll let you know
949.7	953.25	But like for right now all my memories are just absolute terror
953.25	958.79	Are you in slash have you gone to college? I am going to be a junior next year stone, no
958.79	963.83	What was your worst subject in high school um while I'm in high school now and worse subject honestly
963.83	966.65	I think my least favorite would have to be English
966.65	968.6	I just think it's so boring
968.6	973.4	But I think the one that I was like the worst outlet had the worst grade was probably like chemistry
973.4	977.72	But like I actually really liked chemistry so it's kind of like a love-hate favorite animal, okay?
977.72	980.27	I really I really like all animals
980.27	987.27	I think it's easier to say the ones that I don't like I have a actual phobia like no joke dead-ass phobia of
987.27	990.62	Caterpillars I hate them, but I don't even like I don't care about snakes
990.62	995.48	I spiders or if you like if they're near me, I freaked out, but is there like ten feet away from me
995.48	998.76	I don't care um like I'm cool. Doll that
