0.03	6.52	I would meet people and they would be like yo,_unn I'm like this this and that what are you and I'll be like I'm black
6.52	14.019	and they would be like yeah I know but like like like what are you and I would be like <lgh> I'm black like it- and they'll be like
14.019	24.46	No,_unn what_unn are_unn you_unn and that's when I really started to question like who am I <lgh>
24.46	28.0	Where am I from because I re- <sfx>
28.0	35.11	What's up you guys it's your girl Dwa and I'm back with another one um
35.11	41.05	today's video is gonna be a little bit different from y'know what I usually put up on my channel and
41.05	48.7	I guess it's a little bit more serious today vi- today's video is going to be on um
48.7	53.379	I Say like genetics_unn DNA_unn
53.379	60.37	Heritage_unn culture,_unn et cetera So, um
60.37	63.78	Let me <unk> run down so maybe about a year ago uh
63.78	71.229	my principal was sick and I went to go see her in the hospital and while I was there
71.229	75.43	I was telling her somehow some way her and her brother
75.43	79.21	We got on um the topic of culture and stuff like that
79.21	85.299	And I was just telling her like I always wanted to know where I was from yadda yadda ya
85.299	91.14	So fast forward a couple weeks later when she got better she asked me for my address stuff like that
91.14	94.72	and she was like I wanna send you a gift and
94.72	102.85	She sent it to me and it ended up being a twenty three and me now like I said this w- this was a while ago
102.85	106.149	so I got the package and <lgh>
106.149	113.89	I just never opened it around the time that she send* it- sent it
113.89	121.149	I was in the process of moving et cetera et cetera And after that that was in like January when she sent it um
121.149	126.219	No, January, yeah, it was January so it wasn't even a year ago
126.219	132.15	Almost a year 'cause it's <lgh> it's November now but yeah I didn't take it
132.15	138.05	I let it sit I let it sit I let it sit and finally a few months ago I think in
138.05	140.15	September I
140.15	145.31	Finally was like, okay. Let me go ahead and let me take that
145.31	150.41	twenty three and me and I'm also glad that I waited too because if I would've took it as soon as she gave it to me
150.41	156.26	as possible that I wouldn't um I
156.26	160.489	Wouldn't have gotten as like as detailed of
160.489	167.9	Y'know a description of where I'm from because they just now y'know updated the system
167.9	173.87	so in about um I
173.87	177.349	Registered my kit
177.349	181.01	I'ma say what- w- I
181.01	185.18	Feel like I'm kinda like over the- all over the place so I register my kit
185.18	194.45	Around September sixteenth, you know, I do all that nasty stuff I spit in the tube blah blah blah set that out um
194.45	200.26	And around that time I think you have to send it like to one of the Carolinas around that time 
200.26	201.19	of like in September
201.19	206.989	I think that they were going through floodin' so I'm like yeah it's gonna take mad long to get it back
206.989	211.549	But it really didn't at all
211.549	216.47	I'm just tryna like bring up the timeline so like September sixteenth
216.47	223.73	My kit was registered. I'm looking at my email right now September twenty fourth my sample was received
223.73	227.329	and then
227.329	233.45	October second, my reports were ready- of this year all of these dates were
233.45	236.209	two thousand eighteen so October second
236.209	243.68	two thousand eighteen my reports were ready and I've watched a ton of other videos people saying no it took four to five weeks 
243.68	250.51	arrararah_unc blah a long time as y'all can see this was not a long time at all
250.51	257.419	for me at least it was like damn they ready already. So let me get a little bit into the background about my family history or whatever um
257.419	265.22	Honestly, I've never had the culture or like where they're from <unk> talk from my parents or anyone in my family I don't really
265.22	273.56	Think that they care about stuff like that. think I'm the only one because y'know they've never talked about culture and my mom
273.56	278.53	She's a little ignant. So uh I don't think if I will even ask I'll be like yo mom do you know
278.53	282.8	I don't think she know we just grew up um as
282.8	283.94	being
283.94	287.889	African american as being black and that's always what was 
287.889	294.62	y'know what I'm sayin' everybody in my family we're from the upstate uh regions of New York um
294.62	297.349	Grew up here most-
297.349	303.47	grew up here most of the time in my life and I did live in Georgia for a
303.47	309.889	Very small portion of my life, but I- we moved in just because my mom got married we do not have any um
309.889	314.05	Family down there or nothing so I don't have any really no ties to Georgia most of my family
314.05	317.59	Is in upstate New York in this region. So yeah that's it
317.59	325.25	And as for my father uh my father doesn't know much about where we came from. He's- I don't think he's interested in the culture anyway he's never
325.25	330.169	you know had that conversation with me um and h- and honestly
330.169	338.389	To be- to be completely honest. I've never really thought about where I was from and stuff like that until I got to college
338.389	339.74	now
339.74	341.8	Like I said, I am from New York
341.8	346.729	But I'm not from New York City for* those of you who are not from New York state I'm from upstate New York
346.729	348.08	so um
348.08	355.13	When I went to college, it was just like a culture shock even though I'm Black I did- I do go to school at uh
355.13	357.349	PWI predominantly white inst-
357.349	364.55	institution but the percentage of Black people at my school is y'know pretty high it's pretty
364.55	369.889	Good or whatever for the most part for it being a PWI in upstate New York um
369.889	372.02	and
372.02	373.81	When I got there, you know
373.81	378.729	I was meeting people I lived on campus and I would meet people and they would be like yo
378.729	382.909	I'm this this and that what are you and I'll be like I'm black and it would be like 
382.909	390.44	and like yeah I know but like like like what are you and I would be like <lgh> I'm black like it- and they'll be like
390.44	394.38	No,_unn what_unn are_unn you?_unn <lgh>
394.38	399.07	And that's when I really started to question like
399.07	400.87	who am I <lgh>
400.87	404.68	Where am I from because I would see people like they would be
404.68	406.17	Nigerian they would be from Ghana
406.17	412.42	I have a friend who's I think she's cuban a lot of Jamaicans there a lot of Dominicans at my school
412.42	417.79	So it's just like and they are indulging in culture and a lot of people at
417.79	420.57	My school are from New York City the downstate area
420.57	424.81	Y'know the five boroughs Bronx Brooklyn Queens blahblahblahblahblah_unc
424.81	432.19	So down there, you know, it's very culture based and New York City it's just completely different from upstate New York
432.19	436.15	So once I got to college I was just like oh_unn my_unn god_unn
436.15	442.3	Like they got their own different food they got their own y'know they- their own dances it was ju- <lgh>
442.3	448.81	and I'm just <unk> 'cause I'm just black like we don't know like we don't-
448.81	450.25	Jack nothing else <lgh>
450.25	458.05	I just always gonna have me thinking about it 'cause my first couple of years of college just really showed me a lot and
458.05	461.44	Opened up my mind to so many different things so
461.44	465.63	Yeah, ever since then. I've been wondering like damn where am I from or whatever
465.63	469.87	so I'm really grateful that my principal decided to go ahead and um
469.87	472.66	buy me this kit because
472.66	476.5	Lord knows I didn't even even really- I didn't really um know
476.5	479.14	about it, and I never probably
479.14	482.5	would've found out about it if she didn't buy it for me so
482.5	484.39	Yeah um
484.39	486.48	so before prior to taking this test
486.48	492.87	I did look up a few videos and I noticed that they gave you percentage so I kinda like predicted my own percentages-
492.87	497.71	I'm probably- and I was like, I'm probably like ninety five percent African
497.71	503.23	Five percent European 'cause you know all African Americans since we come from that diaspora
503.23	509.88	Um, you know, we always have a little bit of African in us I mean European <unk> in us
509.88	519.19	Um, so yeah, my European percentage was not high at all. I did not guess anything Native American nothing Asian just because like
519.19	529.24	We never had that culture talk in my family so that was really just outta the question
529.24	538.6	Yeah, so as far as what I thought I was because I got this admninistered before I was around a lot of um people 
538.6	545.2	From my school who were African like from Ghana Nigeria um
545.2	552.28	Most of the people that I met at school w- are from there, so I predicted that I was probably either from Ghana or Nigeria
552.28	556.21	Nigeria and um
556.21	559.81	That's pretty much it I didn't guess anywhere else
559.81	562.38	Just because of the diaspora and y'know
562.38	563.35	knowing that history and
563.35	570.94	another thing people from my school is when I would just tell I'm just black it's like they they they forgot this whole
570.94	573.9	four hundred years in history it just went blank from their mind
573.9	579.73	like they was like really in awe that I didn't know where I was from and they'd be like what_unn do_unn you-_unn what_unn do_unn you_unn mean_unn you're_unn just_unn black_unn what_unn do_unn you_unn
579.73	584.02	mean_unn I'm just like
584.02	588.01	Yeah
588.01	590.02	My bad y'all I was really interrupted
590.02	598.06	But like I was saying like they will forget that you know this whole point in history actually took place and there is people in America
598.06	599.77	That are black
599.77	605.7	That don't know where they come from in Africa. I have a message in my phone right now from people that I've talked to that 
605.7	608.38	I've known that they're like what_unn do_unn you_unn mean_unn
608.38	613.45	And it just at that point it was kinda getting aggravating 'cause it's like at the end of the day
613.45	621.97	You're in America. It's not like I'm living in Africa, y'know what I'm sayin' and I don't know this you're in America you should be well familiar um
621.97	625.62	Very familiar with what- w- what occurred here. and- and what happened
625.62	634.57	I'm pretty sure everybody in um the New York State area is just they_unn know_unn where_unn they_unn come_unn from_unn they_unn all_unn Caribbean_unn Haitian_unn 
634.57	638.5	Jamaican_unn <unk> like_unn
638.5	643.15	Yeah, of- that's another thing it's* a lot of- it's a lot of Caribbeans at my school um
643.15	651.31	A lot of that and if anything in this video is offending you I'm sorry I'm not- I don't not- <lgh>
651.31	658.819	I'm not tryna be offensive. I'm not trying to y'know come at anyone I'm just speaking my truth
658.819	667.369	So I got my results back and when I tell y'all I was hype <lgh>
667.369	679.069	Ciao_unc I was hype so let's- let's do a let's do a drumroll for these results <lgh> Hey_unn I'm openin' it up
679.069	683.149	'cause I actually sent it to uh my guy friend um
683.149	692.269	'cause I was just so excited. So your girl <unk> that's me Dwa Lew I am
692.269	701.179	Ninety point four percent African <lgh> 
701.179	709.789	I'm blacker than black blackity black black black black black black black black black black_unc black
709.789	719.089	Okay, and guess what was- guess what was my highest percentage guess what was- guess what was my highest percentage there's_unc something_unc on_unc my_unc lip_unc
719.089	721.249	Nigerian I'm a Nigeria- <lgh>
721.249	724.129	I
724.129	731.539	Was thirty eight point nine, I don't know if y'all could- but yeah your girl is thirty eight p- ooh_unn
731.539	733.999	point nine percent
733.999	737.089	Nigerian, so I'm gonna read the breakdown
737.089	738.859	after that, it says 
738.859	742.549	sixteen point zero percent coastal West African
742.549	746.329	six point seven eight six point seven
746.329	748.279	percent
748.279	754.879	From the Congo Congolese. I'm not s- no- sure if I'm saying that right correct me in the comments um if six point one percent
754.879	757.339	y'know you know the correct way 
757.339	759.559	say that a
759.559	764.149	Lot of these. I don't know how to say Senegambian
764.149	768.319	Six point one percent. I know I just slaughtered that um
768.319	777.079	sou- Southern East African one point s- one point four percent African hunter gatherer whatever that means one point four percent
777.079	782.779	Sudanese.* zero point one broadly West African which-
782.779	785.769	<unk> west_unn African_unn what do you mean that's why I- I gone_unc over this today
785.769	792.37	I was trying to be like cultural even though this is low key Jamaican colors but you know Nigerian flag is green and white
792.37	796.39	I try to give y'all- I try to give a little hint okay trying to give y'all a little hint
796.39	797.87	It's green and white but y'know
797.87	806.24	The yellow had to do because I don't have anything that's green and white and I like Jamaicans anyway <unk> okay anyways <lgh>
806.24	809.36	So yeah that makes up and then you know
809.36	811.64	one point six percent broadly
811.64	818.6	s- Southern east it just makes up a whole bunch of things and broadly sub saha- sub Saharan african four point oh
818.6	823.01	so if i'm ninety point four percent
823.01	828.56	African how much my European
828.56	831.71	How much
831.71	835.58	Seven point eight percent
835.58	837.68	European_unn
837.68	845.63	I'll take that and my highest percentage for being European was broadly Northwestern European three point two percent
845.63	848.24	British and Irish one point three
848.24	852.08	Scandinavian one point one
852.08	853.88	French and German zero point nine
853.88	856.7	Broadly European one point four
856.7	861.86	This next one really shocked me because I never heard that story uh
861.86	867.08	Growin' up like oh, you're_unn Native_unn American._unn you're_unn a_unn this_unn you're_unn a_unn that_unn
867.08	869.45	Never got fed any of those lies
869.45	872.78	but according to this my genetic makeup
872.78	879.02	East Asian and Native American. I am one point three percent and that percentage is really low
879.02	885.41	But I'm surprised that it existed. anyway it says that I am Native American
885.41	887.63	w- one percent
887.63	893.84	woohoo that doesn't ugh that don't even excite me like woo_unn I'm_unn one_unn percent_unn Native_unn American_unn
893.84	900.62	And uh I said broadly northern* northern Asian and Native American zero point one percent
900.62	904.13	Broadly Chinese and Southeast Asian zero point one percent
904.13	910.64	So that makes up my one point three percent East Asian and Native American undesigned* and unassigned was zero point five
910.64	914.09	So yeah, I was extremely
914.09	919.07	Excited for y'know these results um
919.07	922.12	But what I wanna do is and let me know if you guys are interested
922.12	929.51	I kinda wanna take the ancestry DNA one just because I feel like that one is a little bit more
929.51	932.26	Accurate just because they have a broader um
932.26	933.35	I
933.35	941.24	Guess genetic pool to detect exactly where you're from because the videos I watched prior um
941.24	944.779	To me getting my reports a lotta people
944.779	949.76	You know like did this with twenty three and me it would just say that they were
949.76	956.57	Sub saharan African that's it was like three categories and then they really got into their European descent
956.57	959.33	but I kinda wanna um
959.33	962.71	Do an ancestry DNA and I'll purchase that with my own money
962.71	967.55	but I'll only do it if you guys have any interest in in* it 'cause
967.55	970.4	seventy eighty dollars and <lgh>
970.4	976.31	I already know I'm Nigerian so I don't- I don't know if I need to know any more okay
976.31	981.17	but yeah, I was hype when I found I was Nigerian like
981.17	984.23	You know what I'm sayin' I was about to go 
984.23	1026.39	back to school_unn like_unn eyy_unn [Music]
1026.39	1029.529	Let me stop I'll get copyrighted again I'm always doin' that
1029.529	1038.24	Um, I was extremely excited I was in DC last week 'cause of my birthday I was in an Uber like yes I'm Nigerian <lgh>
1038.24	1045.589	And I hope any fellow Nigerians that happen to see this please don't feel offended I'm actually very excited that
1045.589	1050.99	I come from that country and that I know a little bit more about myself 
1050.99	1059.63	'cause if I have- do have kids I can tell them a little bit at least about theirselves and stuff like that so
1059.63	1065.779	Hmm I think that's gonna conclude this video, like I said, I was extremely excited to know that I'm that black
1065.779	1069.409	I'm black. I'm black. I'm tougher_unn than_unn
1069.409	1072.86	Nigerian_unn air_unn um yeah
1072.86	1078.94	Yeah, so that's pretty much it I'm sorry if I was rantin' a little bit in this video but like I said
1078.94	1082.669	I was just super excited and um
1082.669	1087.35	Hope to see you guys_unn on_unn the next_unn one_unn
1087.35	1091.809	Comment below if y'all wanna see one from ancestry DNA okay bye guys_unn
