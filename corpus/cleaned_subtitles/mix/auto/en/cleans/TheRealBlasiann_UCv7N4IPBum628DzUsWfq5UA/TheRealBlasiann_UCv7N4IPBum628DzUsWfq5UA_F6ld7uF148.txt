128.879	130.16	malaysian
130.16	133.84	let's get into this video right now
133.84	136.4	so the first question is how old are you
136.4	137.599	what's your sign and when is your
137.599	138.239	birthday
138.239	141.2	so i just turned twenty-two years old my
141.2	142.8	birthday is september fifteen
142.8	145.92	1998 and i am a
145.92	148.8	virgo no cocky [ __ ] i feel like burgers
148.8	150.0	is the best sign
150.0	152.16	like if i wasn't even a virgo i would
152.16	153.84	still say virgos is the best sign
153.84	156.56	because what like beyonce's a virgo
156.56	157.519	queen of b
157.519	160.8	is a virgo
160.8	165.04	okay question number two
165.04	166.8	are you still in school and what school
166.8	169.44	do you go to i am currently enrolled as
169.44	171.599	a senior at ucla this is my
171.599	175.12	last year thank god
175.12	179.44	um yeah so i'm still in school i'm doing
179.44	181.28	it online because of rona
181.28	184.48	but i just want to walk the stage
184.48	186.0	honestly i don't care where i'm doing
186.0	187.36	school from just as long as i get to
187.36	189.519	walk that stage in june
189.519	192.0	and do my little this little cross
192.0	193.68	stitch i'm good
193.68	195.12	question number three any advice for
195.12	197.28	high schoolers or college advice
197.28	199.44	um let me think back to when i was in
199.44	200.959	high school because that
200.959	203.04	was a really long time ago i graduated
203.04	204.879	in 2016
204.879	207.84	but i personally did not take high
207.84	210.879	school serious at all
210.879	213.599	um freshman year i had straight a's i
213.599	214.319	was like
214.319	216.319	real good kids sophomore and junior
216.319	218.4	definitely worked hard and they kept
218.4	222.64	my butt senior year i picked up
222.64	224.879	the slack and my grades was good just
224.879	226.159	like freshman year
226.159	228.56	but i feel like colleges really look at
228.56	229.28	your
229.28	231.2	sophomore and junior year grades not so
231.2	233.519	much your freshman or your senior year
233.519	236.56	um and that's where like i got that
236.56	238.56	and so with the grades that i had in my
238.56	240.64	overall gpa i just knew i wasn't going
240.64	242.64	to be able to go to like berkeley or
242.64	244.64	ucla
244.64	247.2	all the top schools that i would hope to
247.2	248.56	have went to
248.56	251.04	so i chose the route of going to a
251.04	252.64	junior college for two years
252.64	255.599	i went to de anza community college i
255.599	257.759	play basketball for them too
257.759	259.359	but i went to danza community college
259.359	261.519	for two years and then i reapplied to
261.519	263.199	colleges
263.199	264.88	after the two years and i ended up
264.88	266.4	getting into ucla
266.4	268.4	high school advice i would definitely
268.4	269.44	say
269.44	272.479	take your grades seriously like
272.479	275.199	if you don't want to go to a jc for two
275.199	276.56	years and you want to go straight
276.56	278.639	out of high school take high school
278.639	279.6	seriously
279.6	283.44	but also make time for your social life
283.44	285.199	so you have to find a balance between
285.199	287.28	your social life and your school life
287.28	290.16	um me i was more of just like social
290.16	290.639	life so
290.639	293.12	i was an athlete i was just you know
293.12	294.0	wanted to
294.0	297.919	play ball and all that
297.919	299.84	but i went to an all asian school so it
299.84	301.84	was a lot of pressure on the students
301.84	303.52	that went there because
303.52	305.919	not stereotyping not trying to be racist
305.919	307.199	or nothing but
307.199	310.4	asians are known to take schooling more
310.4	313.44	serious you know so i would definitely
313.44	314.479	say
314.479	317.52	do work hard but
317.52	320.639	find a balance again between schoolwork
320.639	322.16	and your social life because you have to
322.16	324.4	have both there you can't just have a
324.4	326.0	school life and no social life whereas
326.0	328.24	you're gonna go crazy advice for
328.24	332.32	college college my first two years
332.32	334.88	of community college was so fun because
334.88	336.56	i don't know when i went to college
336.56	338.72	i was expecting it to be a heavy
338.72	340.639	workload i'm gonna be stressed out it's
340.639	342.56	gonna be so many classes so much
342.56	344.08	going on because i was playing
344.08	345.36	basketball too so i was like there's no
345.36	346.8	way i'm gonna be able to juggle this
346.8	348.72	but i did really well my first two years
348.72	350.88	of college while i was still playing
350.88	354.08	ball um i made so many new friends like
354.08	356.16	all the athletes were in the same class
356.16	357.6	so y'all can imagine just a whole
357.6	358.479	classroom full of
358.479	360.16	football players basketball players
360.16	361.759	baseball players soccer players like
361.759	364.88	it was lit okay
364.88	366.479	but that was good because you're
366.479	368.4	surrounded by people who
368.4	369.919	know what you're going through what
369.919	372.16	you're experiencing having a juggle
372.16	374.56	okay i got a game this day but i got a
374.56	376.72	midterm and final this day too like you
376.72	377.12	know
377.12	380.319	we were all like in cahoots with
380.319	382.24	each other like supporting each other
382.24	383.36	through the whole
383.36	386.72	class and that was really good
386.72	389.039	advice for college so when i got to ucla
389.039	390.639	i really didn't
390.639	394.4	make friends like i was making at a jc
394.4	394.88	like
394.88	396.56	it was a whole different ballgame for me
396.56	397.919	a new environment i'm
397.919	401.12	originally from the bay area so i moved
401.12	402.72	down to southern california
402.72	405.759	la to go to school and i knew nobody
405.759	407.919	there i knew one girl that's from
407.919	410.639	vallejo california which is like
410.639	414.08	thirty minutes from me um and she was going
414.08	416.319	to you see she got into ucla as well
416.319	417.68	and that was like the only person i was
417.68	419.199	kind of hanging out with we had so many
419.199	420.16	classes together
420.16	423.759	like that destiny if you ever watch
423.759	426.0	this shout out to you because girl you
426.0	428.0	helped me a lot
428.0	429.68	but that was the only person that i
429.68	431.759	really know uh when we would go to
431.759	433.759	parties i'd just go with destiny and her
433.759	435.199	friends like i never
435.199	437.199	made friends outside of destiny except
437.199	439.919	for one and her name was cheyenne
439.919	442.319	cheyenne if you ever watch this i miss
442.319	443.44	you and i love you
443.44	447.039	we fell off on some like weak [ __ ]
447.039	451.039	but girl come
451.039	453.599	and those two people really helped me my
453.599	455.52	daily routine considered me like going
455.52	458.639	to class coming back to my dorm
458.639	461.919	studying i would step out
461.919	464.479	every now and then to like do laundry or
464.479	466.479	go grab something from the cafe but most
466.479	468.0	of the time like
468.0	470.56	i was door dashing through my jar my
470.56	471.36	parents were
471.36	474.96	paying thousands of dollars for like the
474.96	475.759	food
475.759	477.919	slash meal program and i was not
477.919	479.039	utilizing it
479.039	481.52	i had so many swipes left like when i
481.52	482.479	left ucla
482.479	484.639	and came back home because of corona i
484.639	487.759	had so many swipes left
487.759	490.879	it was bad oh and another tip
490.879	493.919	or not tip but college advice
493.919	497.199	save your money while you are in school
497.199	498.4	that is so
498.4	501.599	important like i wouldn't say i depended
501.599	503.44	on my parents a lot while i was in
503.44	505.36	school because i was still making my own
505.36	506.319	money
506.319	509.599	but it's really important to save save
509.599	511.759	save that money like if you have parents
511.759	513.68	that are going to support you and pay
513.68	515.2	for your schooling and your books and
515.2	518.0	all that be appreciated because i
518.0	519.76	know a lot of people whose parents are
519.76	521.44	more so like oh no
521.44	523.36	like you're making money you go pay for
523.36	525.519	your books and college books is like 200
525.519	528.8	of 150 a book
528.8	531.76	so save your money if you can question
531.76	534.32	number four how did i get into ucla
534.32	536.64	i kind of talked about this already but
536.64	538.48	i got into ucla
538.48	540.399	after doing two years at a community
540.399	542.32	college in my city
542.32	544.72	um i had really good grades i worked
544.72	546.24	really really hard
546.24	549.279	um utilize your college counselors my
549.279	551.2	counselor louise
551.2	554.32	she helped me so
554.32	556.72	much like i didn't know how to apply for
556.72	558.56	colleges i'm thinking i'm gonna have to
558.56	558.959	write
558.959	562.0	so many essays so many you
562.0	565.279	know about means and why i should get
565.279	566.72	accepted and it's not i didn't have to
566.72	567.04	do
567.04	569.279	none of that it was simply just like
569.279	570.8	filling out paperwork
570.8	572.399	boo boom but touching your parents
572.399	574.24	income you know whatever it is
574.24	576.88	boop send it off and she really really
576.88	579.68	helped me because i ended up being
579.68	582.56	um i ended up being behind on some
582.56	583.04	credits
583.04	585.519	which caused me to stay like an extra
585.519	587.12	two quarters at the answer
587.12	588.64	so i ended up really being there for
588.64	591.36	three years two and a half three years
591.36	593.12	taking the last quarter off then
593.12	596.48	transferring that following square

828.48	830.0	forever about this but we're just gonna
830.0	832.72	keep it short and sweet
832.72	834.639	what's your favorite color my favorite
834.639	836.0	color is pink
836.0	839.04	not the hot pink not the bright pink the

839.519	842.8	soft pink like the very light blush pink
842.8	844.48	question eleven what is your favorite
844.48	845.839	designer brand
845.839	849.36	i am a designer junkie like
849.36	853.279	i love expensive stuff um
853.279	856.8	i love gucci i really am so in love with
856.8	858.0	chanel
858.0	862.079	i like prada um
862.079	865.76	versace is cool davinci is cool
865.76	868.639	um i'm trying to think offlight is cool
868.639	868.959	but
868.959	871.839	i think my favorite brand really is
871.839	872.959	chanel
872.959	876.24	like them sneakers yeah
876.24	880.56	what question twelve how do you save money
880.56	883.68	this is hard because i spend so
883.68	887.04	much money like
887.04	890.079	it's done but what i
890.079	892.8	used to do is before i started getting
892.8	893.279	that
893.279	896.399	big bag what i used to do was when i
896.399	897.519	would get paid
897.519	900.88	i would put half of my check
900.88	903.76	in my savings and then like half of my
903.76	904.639	check it was
904.639	907.279	to spend so it might not be half it
907.279	907.92	might be
907.92	909.6	majority of my check went to my savings
909.6	911.04	and i would keep like 100 or
911.04	912.88	hundred dollars for me to spend and i
912.88	914.72	did that every paycheck and i wasn't
914.72	916.079	really spending then
916.079	917.839	so like if you have two hundred dollars
917.839	919.6	and say your checkings and then your
919.6	920.959	next check you put it under two hundred
920.959	922.88	dollars it starts stacking nothing sorry
922.88	924.56	is so money so you got some money in
924.56	925.519	your checkings
925.519	927.12	but you also got some money in your
927.12	929.92	savings you got to do it like that
929.92	933.36	and if you can't buy something let's say
933.36	936.079	five times over don't buy it once and
936.079	937.6	this doesn't go for like
937.6	940.639	your dream house or a car that you want
940.639	941.199	or whatever
941.199	943.519	this goes for like the materialistic
943.519	945.44	designer things the
945.44	948.48	the non essential
948.48	950.72	things question number thirteen where are you
