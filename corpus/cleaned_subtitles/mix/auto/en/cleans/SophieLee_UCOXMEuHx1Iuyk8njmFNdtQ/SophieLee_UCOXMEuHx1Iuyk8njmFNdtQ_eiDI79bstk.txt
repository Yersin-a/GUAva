18.09	20.67	so I love actually watching these videos
20.67	23.519	on YouTube so I decided to do it for you
23.519	25.529	guys I have fifty facts took me a long time

28.949	31.71	about me I feel like my lashes are a
31.71	33.0	little crazy today these are very
33.0	34.92	dramatic lashes for me you know I don't
34.92	37.17	usually wear eyelashes this dramatic
37.17	40.739	alright so I will be keeping track of
40.739	43.02	the numbers on the screen I have my
43.02	46.14	computer right here with all of my fifty
46.14	49.28	facts so let's just hop right into it
49.28	53.1	okay so my full name is Sophia Lee sada
53.1	55.26	everyone calls me Sophie that like no
55.26	56.85	one okay there are a few people who call
56.85	58.92	me Sophia like my dad and like my
58.92	61.739	grandpa like some of my aunts and uncles
61.739	63.899	but basically everyone calls me Sophie
63.899	68.31	like and like all my friends my mom my
68.31	71.28	brother my dad sometimes but yeah
71.28	73.17	everyone calls me Sophie also no one
73.17	74.46	ever knows how to pronounce my last name
74.46	75.9	it's really easy it's literally how it's
75.9	78.81	written just say des I was born in New
78.81	80.759	York City I was born in Manhattan I
80.759	84.119	moved to New Jersey when I was six years
84.119	88.409	old my birthday is March fifteen 1999 and
88.409	90.96	that makes me a Pisces I don't really
90.96	93.45	follow like astrological signs and stuff
93.45	94.619	like that or I don't read my horoscope
94.619	97.71	but I'm a Pisces and that would make me
97.71	99.09	eighteen years old
99.09	101.579	I have one brother Bennet you probably
101.579	103.259	know him if you watch my vlogs he's
103.259	106.02	always in them also I have a dog his
106.02	108.689	name is Jerry and Jerry is a labradoodle
108.689	111.18	and I love him very much and he's my
111.18	113.82	best friend I love him and if you can
113.82	115.409	put that together it's Ben and Jerry
115.409	117.0	like the ice cream so my brother and my
117.0	119.28	dog are Ben and Jerry that was
119.28	121.95	purposeful I am super close with both of
121.95	124.079	my parents I'm very happy and like lucky
124.079	126.21	that money my parents are so close I
126.21	127.68	have a pretty diverse background
127.68	130.849	I am half Taiwanese 1/4 Lebon
130.849	134.18	and a quarter like European /
134.18	136.67	french canadian I don't really know I am
136.67	140.389	right handed so when I was younger up
140.389	144.319	until like middle school I was super
144.319	146.599	into theater I loved I did all the
146.599	149.03	musicals at school I did some community
149.03	150.98	theater and I really wanted to be on
150.98	153.68	Broadway but now I don't really do
153.68	155.42	theater anymore I actually went to
155.42	157.849	speeder sleepaway camp for like four
157.849	159.59	years but now I don't want to do theater
159.59	161.48	as much I actually want to be a criminal
161.48	163.579	lawyer when I grow up as of right now
163.579	166.01	that could change I never know so this
166.01	167.959	fall I'm going to be a freshman at NYU
167.959	170.569	I'm going into my first year at college
170.569	172.969	also I'm this is like random side now
172.969	175.219	I'm planning on doing like NYU related
175.219	177.159	videos once I get to school so
177.159	179.389	eventually keep your eye out for those
179.389	183.379	so my best friend is lose you probably
183.379	185.959	have seen her and some videos on my
185.959	188.269	channel before I love her very much
188.269	190.069	and she has her own YouTube channel so
190.069	192.019	go check her out so I actually started
192.019	194.18	doing makeup when I was in seventh grade
194.18	196.4	my mom found that we do makeup and it
196.4	197.93	was it was a whole mess I didn't know
197.93	199.31	what I was doing I liked her blue
199.31	201.59	eyeliner a lot it was not a good look
201.59	203.93	I'm sorry I like blue eyeliner and eye
203.93	205.729	shadow or like purple and I drew school
205.729	208.489	like every single day it was so bad but
208.489	210.62	I didn't really get like really serious
210.62	212.15	and to makeup until I was in tenth grade
212.15	214.699	I still wasn't that good but that's
214.699	216.139	really when I started like building my
216.139	219.53	collection and just learning a lot more
219.53	221.0	about how to do my makeup and that kind
221.0	223.28	of stuff so when I was a freshman in
223.28	225.319	high school I was super into doing nail
225.319	227.54	art I mean I wasn't super great at it
227.54	229.639	but I loved doing it like I would spend
229.639	232.639	like two hours painting my nails doing
232.639	234.65	like different things like I painted
234.65	237.59	cupcakes on my nails I think I did like
237.59	239.569	little cows on my nails ones I don't
239.569	241.25	know super into it I don't really do it
241.25	242.84	anymore and now I just like get my nail
242.84	244.879	done and I do gel or I just paint my
244.879	246.349	normal nails but I have a pretty big
246.349	249.709	nail polish collection also I am five foot
249.709	252.919	five I'm technically five foot four and 3/four but I
252.919	255.859	just say I'm five foot five I have broken two
255.859	259.909	bones before I broke my left wrist when
259.909	262.219	I was in second grade and I also broke
262.219	264.3	one of my ankle I don't
264.3	265.5	literally don't remember which angle
265.5	268.11	stood my left on my right but I broke
268.11	270.84	that in 5th grade I also got a
270.84	272.22	concussion freshman year of high school
272.22	275.34	and I hit my head on my wall and I got a
275.34	277.229	like relatively minor concussion I was
277.229	278.849	out of school for a week but yes I hit
278.849	280.889	my head on my own bedroom wall and I got
280.889	283.949	a concussion I have never had braces I
283.949	286.259	used to have like one of those like
286.259	288.629	permanent retainers on my bottom teeth
288.629	289.889	and then on the top
289.889	292.71	I had this retainer that I never wore so
292.71	294.15	my teeth just like straightened out on
294.15	295.47	their own I don't know how that happened
295.47	298.11	but they did so I got glasses when I was
298.11	300.719	eight years old and now I just wear contacts
300.719	302.219	I got contacts in middle school and I
302.219	304.56	hate wearing my glasses I rarely wear
304.56	306.03	them I just wear contacts basically
306.03	308.069	every single day I have a really bad
308.069	310.5	habit of biting my nails so that's
310.5	312.27	honestly why I always have nail polish
312.27	314.039	on my nails because otherwise my nail
314.039	315.389	pleasure is off I'll bite my nails
315.389	318.81	end of story I have traveled to twenty eight
318.81	321.21	different countries I love traveling my
321.21	323.909	family and I travel everywhere I'm super

339.389	341.49	throwing up anyone else throwing up yeah
341.49	342.96	it's really bad if it'll be out like
342.96	345.18	I'll have a full blown panic attack if

347.43	351.029	pretty bad my favorite food is pasta I

645.569	647.009	then my third favorite season is summer
647.009	649.05	and then I hate spring and that is
649.05	652.649	because I am allergic to pollen and I I
652.649	653.939	used have really really really bad
653.939	656.1	pollen allergies and now they're not as
656.1	657.99	bad but they're still like pretty bad

670.5	673.14	at the same time I'm not like super like
673.14	675.75	I'm not super super super clean because
675.75	677.46	I need a lot of time to organize a long
677.46	679.65	time I don't have time so then things
679.65	681.03	kind of get like a little messy I
681.03	683.82	wouldn't say I'm a messy person but I'm
683.82	686.04	not like super clean but like when I get
686.04	687.84	the chance I love to organize like my
687.84	690.96	books on my shelf are alphabetized they
690.96	692.43	love color coding things that kind of
692.43	695.13	stuff yes I love it all right so those
