0.56	3.76	*groans* 
3.76	4.336	nah!
4.336	12.4	my microphone stand <lgh>
12.4	13.922	hi it's annabelle
13.922	18.08	it's nice to see you again, i can't wait to catch up through this Q and A
18.08	21.044	um- I_unn uh_unn 
21.044	23.72	thank you to everybody who submitted questions.
23.72	27.606	also in the description, you can jump to specific questions or come back to them.
27.606	34.349	i think the easiest thing to start off with many people are excited to learn about bambi and prairie how they're doing.
34.349	39.085	i expected that prairie would be very standoffish, i said give her a week.
39.085	44.523	i think it really only took her four days? we were at lilith's for the first week
44.523	52.687	when i had to organize my storage unit but i don't wanna explain all of that process too in detail because the vlog is coming out next week
52.687	54.256	show not tell, right?
54.256	61.043	good news is after we settled into this new york space- three days or so, they were already playing, chasing each other,
61.043	64.997	grooming each other, and i think like the only step left is for them to cuddle.
64.997	70.082	i was a little bit worried whether or not they would feel disappointed or cabin fever from
70.082	72.735	being in this studio apartment,
72.735	74.975	bambi's been living in a two bedroom
74.975	77.35	two story house for a year
77.35	81.627	and even my sister's apartment* pah- puh- p- apartment_unn
81.627	89.18	is bigger. it's a huge downgrade but, i do keep in mind just like what i feel would be healthy.
89.18	93.157	i almost got another studio apartment with no view
93.157	99.628	right off the bat, i just had a bad feeling about that place. my sister was just like this jeopardizes cat vitality or something like that
99.628	103.808	maybe i can take them out on walks again but from experience,
103.808	110.209	neither of them liked it very much. i don't think that the space is actually too small for the three of us here
110.209	116.968	because like they're two tiny cats and i make sure that there's plenty of perching spots for them whether it be like all over this couch,
116.968	120.784	they have their own couch, they have the castle, the table top and the bed
120.784	123.05	and they love to switch out their resting spots,
123.05	127.569	and they kind of have like this routine. maybe i'll do a day in the life of prairie and bambi one day.
127.569	131.292	on to me  what am i most excited about living in new york?
131.292	133.164	explore more of the city of course
133.164	135.619	and to make new friends.
135.619	140.17	i've been really anxious all my life when it comes to making friends
140.17	144.111	and i have a really great set of friends
144.111	144.72	how do i say that-
144.72	150.021	we're not like in a big group or anything i've- i have really strong one on one bonds
150.021	153.46	but now that i'm an adult and self employed it's just a lot harder to meet people right
153.46	156.621	one of the reasons why i wanted to move here is the culture
156.621	162.56	and the arts scene and like maybe i could get a studio residency and just be more hands on  
162.56	165.328	yeah in terms of that living in new york
165.328	167.099	um eating
167.099	170.905	and exploring cool oh you know what <lgh>
170.905	175.415	clubbing, i've never gone to a club or like even a party
175.415	176.562	where i'm like wooo
176.562	179.928	my sister has um a lot more expertise than me so,
179.928	182.115	luckily she doesn't live far,
182.115	189.864	just a train ride, she's gonna come over and in the uh occasional nights where i don't sleep before ten
189.864	192.718	so i have to figure out how i'm going to-
192.718	195.073	did i always know i was gonna come to new york?
195.073	202.073	no there were maybe two or three times i was like hoping i can come to new york and even making plans or looking at apartments
202.073	205.04	but it never even solidified
205.04	207.804	in the back of my mind i just sort of
207.804	214.485	if this dream was a balloon i just kinda let it go and watched it float far away in the sky i was like, it's okay,
214.485	216.375	it doesn't have to be my life
216.375	218.38	i'm proud of myself for being here.
218.38	220.134	i'm never bored.
220.134	225.672	when i was reading the book flow they were kind of saying you don't wanna be in a state of either boredom or anxiety,
225.672	227.378	you want to find flow.
227.378	235.307	i'm always on the anxiety side but occasionally, i do find that nice  flow and i- i enjoy my day when i plan it out nicely.
235.307	239.382	do i miss home? i've not been here long enough to feel homesick
239.382	248.134	i really enjoy the independence. i'm sure as time goes on i will begin to miss my family but now that i'm not in school, i
248.134	254.884	okay i've been having extreme brain farts i don't know what happened here i meant to say, now that i'm out of school
254.884	261.52	my schedule doesn't have to work around going home only on holiday breaks which is nice
261.52	262.838	do i miss home?
262.838	265.295	it definitely gets quiet sometimes at night,
265.295	269.87	i kinda just get myself in a mood to really enjoy the evening and like
269.87	276.222	take it slow and stuff- i can make videos about this if you're interested in terms of just being homesick in general,
276.222	283.066	i moved around so much growing up i never feel attached to any one place. i used to be a lot more attached to objects which haf-
283.066	286.0	has changed recently
286.0	294.409	but like i think what i have the hardest time letting go of are like memories of a time where things were once like this
294.409	296.381	and they will never be like that again.
296.381	305.84	my yeye_cs which is my m- wait what per- paternal grandfather and i had a really close relationship and he's
305.84	308.622	he passed away from cancer a long time ago
308.622	314.008	i had some of the most happiest memories um of my life
314.008	320.48	so i still ruminate on a lotta those memories it's like equal parts
320.48	323.296	sorrow and joy
323.296	326.088	so here in new york do i feel free or released?
326.088	331.577	the main difference is being able to do things by my own schedule,
331.577	337.735	cooking my own meals, right like my grandma's not there to take care of me but at the same time i won't feel the pressure
337.735	346.383	and the guilt to say like i needa eat dinner an hour later, like organize my time without needing to explain myself has definitely
346.383	349.363	saved some mental energy but at the same time
349.363	353.6	it was never too bad because living in my family house um
353.6	355.186	it was really comfortable.
355.186	359.884	the only huge difference is like the first time i went grocery shopping
359.884	361.645	i was just like what the fu-
361.645	367.698	living at home for a year has like screwed me over because i completely forgot my meal plan,
367.698	369.82	it's been a long time since i've shopped for myself.
369.82	372.925	i definitely don't think i'm gonna stay in new york forever,
372.925	381.982	the way i eventually want to live my life maybe have like a little store or a cafe and have like a nice quiet home with my family
381.982	387.887	and i can't afford anywhere like near new york city i just don't think that's realistic here.
387.887	391.303	the worst parts of living alone?
391.303	398.809	having to face the crises all by yourself. at school, y'know those nights where the cats would catch this mouse?
398.809	402.449	maybe one was missing its head or whatever? y'know- you have to pick it up yourself!
402.449	411.432	so i've been paying for my own bills since i moved out of my college dorm. the only main things i rely on my mom for is phone
411.432	414.134	like we're still on a family phone plan.
414.134	422.513	other responsibilities that i'm going to look into that i haven't previously done is like renter's insurance, cat health insurance
422.513	428.971	we don't have dental insurance so i'm going to have to go like i have a cavity ugh_unn
428.971	431.682	poopy parts of being an adult of course but inevitable.
431.682	434.361	probably_unn gonna_unn have_unn to_unn spend_unn three_unn hundred_unn dollars_unn on_unn that_unn cavity_unn
434.361	440.208	lilith doesn't live so far from me she's in rhode island still and she's gonna take the train in next week and i'm gonna see her,
440.208	445.319	so i'm excited. it kind of reminds me of the gilmore girls uh intro song
445.319	451.159	all_unn you_unn have_unn to_unn do_unn is_unn call_unn my_unn name_unn and_unn i'll_unn be_unn there_unn on_unn the_unn next_unn train_unn
451.159	455.6	where_unn you_unn lead_unn
455.6	457.692	i_unn will_unn follow_unn
457.692	461.74	anywhere_unn that_unn you_unn tell_unn me_unn to_unn
461.74	464.706	i can go and visit her on a train anytime
464.706	470.798	so in terms of my current job uncertainty what the hell i'm doing, how many jobs am i juggling,
470.798	475.186	so the main thing i'm doing is youtube full time and my shop
475.186	483.635	i would say i spend equal energy on both of those and then i run my patreon. i have like a little bit over four hundred amazing patrons
483.635	489.099	that have stuck with me even though i've been the most unproductive ass in the last three months
489.099	495.301	in the beginning i was like overworking myself i don't know like ch- just needing to prove something to myself i think
495.301	499.584	do i fear the uncertainty of this self employment yes_unn
499.584	503.46	yes_unn every_unn day_unn
503.46	505.995	every_unn waking_unn moment_unn
505.995	510.867	you know i haven't been as active on youtube i appreciate when people say  they miss me on youtube
510.867	515.527	'cause i'm just like it makes me realize that i used to be a lot more productive so
515.527	526.3	as soon as i cover all my bases like make a nice spreadsheet of my financials, i wanna make enough for savings, then we can talk about um like what do you call it like expendable income
526.3	531.336	it's worth it for me. yes i can be saving like thousands of dollars by living at home
531.336	535.26	but like not only is being in the suburbs just
535.26	538.268	too it's like drying me out.
538.268	540.499	full on spongebob in the spongebob movie.
540.499	544.508	bird needs to leave the nest as one of my friends put it
544.508	551.042	and a viewer asked me a sort of personal question about if they should go into engineering because
551.042	558.639	it ensures their livelihood in the future because if they instead major in their passion, which is literature
558.639	561.911	like maybe um they would be unemployed and struggling
561.911	567.55	i guess my advice would be ask yourself could you imagine yourself being happy doing engineering?
567.55	575.35	if you had to go into work five days a week probably for decades, doing this field could you actually be happy with it
575.35	582.572	because if you're pretty content and you can get a stable livelihood then you can definitely take classes or go back to school
582.572	592.016	for your passion but, if you just if you cannot like go on living like that which is kind of how i feel about why i needed to pursue art
592.016	595.749	full time even if it means like a life of uncertainty, like to me
595.749	603.336	that rigor is really worth it. but also if you wanna get a degree in literature and you feel like you might not immediately find a job
603.336	605.968	related to your field, that's so normal.
605.968	613.308	even people who graduate with stem backgrounds might end up somewhere not even in- remotely related to their actual major
613.308	618.974	if i were to get a stem job well i am very passionate about biology,
618.974	621.347	i've always enjoyed biology.
621.347	628.412	i used to think i would be great as a nurse i realize i'm kind of faint when it comes to thinking about like surgery or like injuries
628.412	631.035	so i'd- actually don't think i would be great
631.035	639.807	dream job? okay would be some sort of biologist and i get to go in the field to research marine biology or just ecosystems in general,
639.807	649.052	i've seen organizations that do rescue and uh animal rehabilitation or is that like a veterinarian field? or a mix of both?
649.052	655.52	some of you might know that toby ran away last month and that was really unexpected and
655.52	661.372	totally messed up my shop or- operations because i kinda just shut down for a few month- for a few days
661.372	663.021	
663.021	669.942	and during those days one of the things i did was watch our planet on netflix and i've always loved animal documentaries
669.942	671.285	and i really liked that one too
671.285	678.344	i just never got the chance- there were some scary parts like seeing an unbalanced ecosystem, way too many of like this
678.344	687.6	one species and how that affects other species it was super insightful and quite inspiring at the end
687.6	688.928	hm okay
688.928	690.8	so how am i really?
690.8	695.421	i thought i would be a lot more concise when answering this question but, in general i'm doing
695.421	698.707	uh like i'm
698.707	706.759	i just h- realized how much work i have to do on myself and it's cool. my mental health has been so bad for so long
706.759	708.356	i didn't even notice
708.356	714.933	when you're not really thinking about it and you have coping mechanisms that like act as crutches for you to be able to be
714.933	720.567	high functioning at the things that you need to get by with
720.567	725.356	just no more pretending admitting to myself hey i actually don't feel okay at all about this, why do i think that?
725.356	729.346	and unpacking it. i found pretty cool books that have been helpful,
729.346	733.241	podcasts, but finally i- i'm going back to therapy.
733.241	736.63	yesterday i signed up for it. i'm trying a service i haven't done before,
736.63	743.893	so i'm still waiting to get matched to a specific counselor and start the session. i- i just hope that all around,
743.893	747.98	my mental state will improve and that could impact my productivity,
747.98	751.767	how do you really expect anyone to be thriving with the year that we've had?
751.767	755.353	so i give myself a break in terms of that but like also
755.353	758.758	hey, how- how can i make the best with what i'm given ?
758.758	760.208	that's sort of what i'm tryna do right now.
760.208	763.72	so i've been having a long art block for a long_unn time_unn
763.72	767.68	and yes i question my abilities, am i doing enough?
767.68	771.641	am i as good as i think? or i just question that all the time.
771.641	775.795	one of the ways to calm down a little bit is to get off social media.
775.795	782.935	when you're on the explore page sometimes you find so many inspiring people and that fires you up and you wanna paint!
782.935	790.331	but other times it totally over stimulates me and i just get into this paralyzed like huhhh i can't do anything!
790.331	797.331	just a few decades ago we weren't exposed to so many hundreds and thousands of different people living different lives
797.331	806.64	so in our head we kind of compartmentalize all of these internet strangers always thinking that other people are  
806.64	809.75	doing and being more productive than us,
809.75	815.679	that they're struggling less- thriving way more than us, and that we're falling behind seeing like my peers,
815.679	822.278	sometimes i love seeing their illustrations sometimes it just makes me question myself feel like i'm getting nowhere.
822.278	825.414	i do feel like right now i'm nowhere,
825.414	832.366	like as in i don't really know where i wanna go in my life??
832.366	838.224	because in college i have this huge dream that was shattered.
838.224	840.413	like i became really disillusioned
840.413	848.833	i started school wanting to do textiles for fashion and i wanted to do fashion because i was just one person and that person
848.833	852.142	just doesn't exist anymore like i'm not that person anymore
852.142	859.584	so it does make me question like do i wanna even work for a fashion company ? because the person who wanted to work
859.584	863.291	for a fashion company thought that her life was gonna be like this..
863.291	871.6	i really wanna work on illustration because see if i didn't do fashion and if i never pursued that career i would wanna do
871.6	877.427	storytelling um probably animation or write graphic novels.
877.427	880.317	uh my muse currently, they're my cats
880.317	885.282	i'm a freaking cat creature, i live with two of the most charming little things
885.282	892.869	and i've been sketching my cats a lot and i'm p- prepare to see a lot of cat paintings! because i'm just like hey. i have an artist block.
892.869	895.642	what do i do. i'm just gonna paint my cat like there's no tomorrow
895.642	899.673	and maybe one day i will expand my visual vocabulary.
899.673	901.859	do i wanna continue doing textiles, yes!
901.859	904.725	even if i don't want to do it on like a corporate level,
904.725	907.578	freaking textiles is like the most magical thing ever.
907.578	912.88	if you learn the craft of textiles, whether it be weaving crocheting knitting,
912.88	920.72	dyeing, i would never regret having learned what i have learned and the appreciation for textiles  
920.72	925.6	i love it. i have a knitting machine i- i purchased from a friend that i haven't started using  
925.6	929.093	so expect some knitting struggles from me.
929.093	932.16	sometimes to calm myself i think about
932.16	934.929	me as a sixty year old as an eighty year old,
934.929	938.328	i'll probably be making art that speaks to me a lot more,
938.328	946.092	time is just such a gift. every day is such a gift your health, your body is a gift. don't- don't forget that don't let the fast paced world,
946.092	950.874	the consumerist, capitalist world like convince you that you're never enough or you'll never get there.
950.874	956.346	not feeling as rushed and knowing like i have the time to get there someday even if it takes me decades,
956.346	959.912	given that i will be blessed with a long life
959.912	964.498	i hope to live into three digits y- right that the world is still around
964.498	967.31	and not burned to the ground by that time,
967.31	975.198	um what will my art be then? so in that sense i'm not so worried about where i'm going and how many skills i will obtain
975.198	979.44	because every day is just a new opportunity 
979.44	982.074	to improve those skills, to learn more.
982.074	984.679	lastly the miscellaneous stuff!
984.679	986.241	has my style changed?
986.241	994.106	i'm kind of at this blank canvas point in my life where like y'know my hair's grown out now, it's all natural
994.106	998.223	the funniest thing is that i kind of miss having damaged dyed hair
998.223	1006.211	because when it was kind of dry and crispy it had some texture i need some volume. you realize that my head is extra small
1006.211	1010.288	when i was in middle school i had an inside joke with a guy who i called bigfoot.
1010.288	1012.989	right before puberty his feet started growing faster than the rest of his body
1012.989	1016.584	so i called him bigfoot every time i saw him he called me small head
1016.584	1018.503	we'll be like bigfoot_unn small_unn head_unn
1018.503	1023.466	so i'm excited i think i'm reinventing myself, definitely want to make a glow up video,
1023.466	1030.531	i really enjoy watching those, as well as transformation videos, i still haven't transformed myself into my high school self
1030.531	1036.907	i saw uh some footage and i was like- i was sexy when i was a minor?? look at me now.
1036.907	1037.971	i like your hair!
1037.971	1040.333	i quite enjoy how my dark hair looks.
1040.333	1043.76	the last time i had long black hair was when i was fifteen
1043.76	1046.002	so it's been a long time.
1046.002	1047.133	i might as well try.
1047.133	1049.123	try to see if i can grow it out and
1049.123	1056.666	b- before, i had a lot of it thinned out due to the trendy layer cut at the time, everyone was getting their tips thinned out so
1056.666	1063.798	i want to see how nice and thick my hair might look like. hopefully it won't be too flat and uh maybe i can even donate my hair
1063.798	1066.303	if i could resist myself from dyeing it..
1066.303	1066.803	we'll see.
1066.803	1070.294	lastly i just want to talk about music for one hot second
1070.294	1071.728	what's my favorite song of the moment?
1071.728	1075.365	okay so in the last couple months,
1075.365	1077.585	i really fell in love with joji.
1077.585	1080.56	sad songs about love...
1080.56	1083.492	um yeah. i- i really enjoyed joji's albums,
1083.492	1085.36	i can't remember the name of it was it
1085.36	1089.28	broadca- like the album name  i like nectar, i have that one  
1089.28	1094.183	dance- slow dancing in the dark, which is the most famous track.
1094.183	1096.82	i also love clairo* a lot.
1096.82	1099.597	immunity is wonderful but her EP,
1099.597	1105.12	um- h- favorite song from her is hello? that song just makes me wanna go like 
1105.12	1107.508	play the song to me dancing just now.
1107.508	1110.182	what was my favorite song from lana del rey's new album?
1110.182	1113.833	i actually just listened to it for the first time this morning.
1113.833	1122.254	i didn't like it as much as i thought it would. however, i find that all lana songs i have to listen to it a lot and it will grow on me
1122.254	1129.527	and then i'll become obsessed with it like exactly a year and a half after the release date. a lot of the songs seemed super similar
1129.527	1135.02	whereas i feel like in her previous albums they all had their own story
1135.02	1140.91	whereas this one was like the whole album was a continuous song in a way with different chapters..
1140.91	1148.24	so my favorite song as of now is probably not all those who wander are lost or yosemite
1148.24	1151.279	and again this is gonna change
1151.279	1156.461	because from norman fucking rockwell, my favorite song was cherry- wait.
1156.461	1160.372	was bartender, and then now
1160.372	1164.899	it's probably mariner's apartment complex for_unn sure_unn
1164.899	1166.48	those are all the questions for today,
1166.48	1168.976	it's getting hot and i don't shave my pits.
1168.976	1174.475	i had fun catching up with you. thank you for keeping me company! i feel a lot better because with this last week,
1174.475	1176.4	i've just been...
1176.4	1178.842	with everything that's going on in current events,
1178.842	1181.076	i wanna talk about a fundraiser that i'm doing.
1181.076	1190.241	the link is right there in the description and just by announcing it on instagram in the last day we've raised fifteen hundred dollars which is incredible
1190.241	1193.75	i made this l- nice painting of bambi sleeping,
1193.75	1199.569	need a little bit of peace and calm.. one winner is gonna be drawn in a week. it's open worldwide the shipping's included
1199.569	1206.6	so in order to enter, it's five dollars minimum to purchase an entry ticket
1206.6	1209.688	or you can share it on a social platform i think
1209.688	1216.835	for one free entry and the drawing would be generated on better world the organization
1216.835	1224.886	a hundred percent of profits are going to d- be donated to the asian american pacific islander community relief fund
1224.886	1229.091	so i hope that doing this video would um notify some people who don't follow me on instagram.
1229.091	1233.838	also if you are not interested in getting this painting 'cause you just don't like it
1233.838	1241.282	you can also donate to other organizations and GoFundMe's of members of the AAPI community, so you don't have to actually
1241.282	1244.605	use my fundraiser but i just wanted to let you know that's happening
1244.605	1251.735	and yeah i'll see you pretty soon. next week is gonna be the moving vlog. until then take care goodbye!
1251.735	1256.407	bambi doesn't normally chill over here by the toaster,
1256.407	1262.16	i just put him there because i almost filmed the video with that backdrop
1262.16	1263.92	but this cat tree goes_unn over_unn here_unn ugh
