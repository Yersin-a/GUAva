2.83	6.089	Hi everyone. Welcome back to my channel. And in today's video
6.089	10.11	I will be sharing with you guys something that I have been wanting to share on my channel.
10.11	14.28	And it's about my life as a Korean American. So
14.28	17.039	Amy actually tagged me to do the Asian American tag
17.039	20.89	but I wanted to do it a little differently by sharing with you guys my
20.89	26.859	background story first before getting into those details. So I'm gonna start my story now.
26.859	31.62	Um, so, if you didn't know I was born and raised in Los Angeles, California.
31.62	35.14	And when I was about three and when my brother was born, uh,
35.14	38.68	our family we moved to South Korea because my
38.68	43.649	Grandpa was diagnosed with cancer and my parents wanted us to spend time with him.
43.649	48.3	And I remember going to preschool, yuchiwon_cs, in Korea.
48.3	54.25	And, you know, I just grew up like learning how to speak Korean, and that's all I knew.
54.25	59.07	Um, but then when I was five I moved back, and then I started attending school.
59.07	65.08	And I was the only Asian in my school. So
65.08	70.89	obviously I looked very different, and I didn't know the language. So, I mean, as a kid
70.89	74.729	I'm kind of like very similar to what I am now.
74.729	80.53	I'm very extroverted, and I love meeting new people so I didn't really have a problem with making friends.
80.53	85.96	But of course there was that language barrier, but I don't really remember like traumatic
85.96	90.42	experiences like from kindergarten at all. So in first grade,
90.42	95.38	that's when I kind of realized that I was different, because during reading time
95.38	102.34	I was always asked to you know come out of the room and then go to another classroom and
102.34	107.13	do ESL courses with another teacher. And you know that was very helpful for me
107.13	112.96	but I also hated it because I felt very different from my classmates. And they would always be like, oh_unn
112.96	115.74	it's_unn like_unn eleven_unn o'clock_unn, it's_unn time_unn for_unn you_unn to_unn leave_unn the_unn classroom_unn.
115.74	120.04	So that actually motivated me to study harder, and
120.04	122.56	actually, I'll be going into details of this later,
122.56	127.98	but every time people pointed out that I was different or like a certain stereotype
127.98	130.2	I would always work extra hard
130.2	136.05	just so that I would no longer be in ESL and that I could get better grades and things like that. So
136.05	139.11	yeah. In first grade I had to deal with um
139.11	143.9	feeling different because I would always have to step out of the classroom for those ESL courses.
143.9	151.4	And then I also remember a time when my like classmates they were looking through a magazine and
151.4	153.769	it was a Britney Spears magazine.
153.769	160.17	And I remember not knowing who she was and my classmates made fun of me for not knowing who she was. And
160.17	162.41	like I grew up liking kpop
162.41	165.8	so I'm a very OG kpop fan.
165.8	170.34	Like I listened to it back when Fin.K.L_cs was around Baby_cs VOX_cs
170.34	175.319	GOD_cs, Boa_cs, Jang_cs Nara_cs. Like those were like.
175.319	177.12	Those are my idols.
177.12	178.95	So for them to hate on me for
178.95	183.019	not knowing who Britney Spears was, like that was really sad on my end,
183.019	188.94	but I remember like going to like Ralph's and Albertsons just to study the, um, 
188.94	191.997	celebrities, because I had no idea who any of them were.
191.997	193.739	So 2nd grade comes around and
193.739	198.41	a Korean moved to our district, and I was like whoa that's really cool.
198.41	199.92	And I remember teachers
199.92	201.38	asking me to come out of the classroom
201.38	205.41	just to help her, because I knew how to speak both English and Korean now.
205.41	212.01	So I felt really good about doing that because for the first time I felt a sense of worth,
212.01	215.04	because now people were praising me for
215.04	217.29	knowing Korean and Korean culture.
217.29	222.349	So I remember for like a whole year the teachers would always let me sit with this girl.
222.349	226.46	And I would always translate for her, help her do her work and things like that.
226.46	234.5	But then like later, um, I realized that she didn't want to do anything Korean anymore, so I
234.5	236.13	kind of felt...
236.13	237.94	How do I explain this.
237.94	242.78	So I remember this girl kind of avoiding me because she just didn't want to practice Korean anymore.
242.78	246.049	And I remember coming back home, and I told my brother.
246.049	250.19	I was like, Abe from now on we're gonna only speak English at home.
250.19	253.43	And we started doing that to our parents as well.
253.43	259.2	And I remember my mom feeling so sad afterwards, because if you think about it now...
259.2	265.49	If I think about it now, my parents both sacrificed their comfortable life in Korea
265.49	270.78	to move to America for me and my brother. And even after we moved,
270.78	273.24	we still came back after um
273.24	278.69	two years of living in Korea because my parents wanted us to have an education in America.
278.69	285.56	So I felt terrible about that. And I also got in trouble for trying to only speak English at home. And then after that, I
285.56	290.81	was like you know what, I'm just gonna embrace Korean. And at home, it will just be Korean, and outside of it
290.81	294.78	I will just speak English. So I always kept it, um, 
294.78	297.56	like I never shared this information with my friends at school
297.56	302.02	just because I don't know I was always embarrassed about being Korean.
302.02	303.38	So there's a little bit of my foundation. Now
303.38	307.21	I'm going to answer some questions from the asian american tag.
307.21	309.88	I'm korean american.
309.88	312.19	My parents were both born in Seoul South Korea
312.19	315.61	and then they moved to America and then I was born.
315.61	321.79	So I guess I would be one point five generation or second generation my uncle always tells me I'm second generation,
321.79	325.889	but I always feel like I am one point five.
325.889	328.289	I kind of shared this in my background story, 
328.289	333.18	but definitely when my classmates were flipping through the magazine and talking about Britney Spears.
333.18	340.9	I knew there was something different about that. And also none of my classmates looked like me. We had different eyes. We had different hair colors. And
340.9	344.68	yeah. I knew for a fact that I was different. But also, 
344.68	350.279	when we all started to learn about Asian culture in history class, I remember people were like, oh, 
350.279	356.56	what kind of Asian were you again? Were you Chinese or Japanese? And when I would answer, I'm Korean, no one knew
356.56	359.279	what Korea was. And I was like, oh, 
359.279	364.629	that's so strange. Like, I'm Korean, and I know the language and the music and everything,
364.629	366.75	but I felt kind of different there.
366.75	371.199	And then when we learned about Korea, people would ask me, are you north or south? And
371.199	371.699	actually, 
371.699	376.24	I went back home and asked my mom, like, am I North or in my south Korean? And my mom
376.24	382.5	answered that I am South Korean because both my parents were born in Seoul South Korea. But later
382.5	390.25	I also learned that my grandpa, like one of my grandparents, he is from North Korea. And then I got to learn more about
390.25	392.319	um his story and um 
392.319	397.43	his testimony things like that.
397.43	398.36	Even as a child
398.36	405.02	I was always very proud to be Korean, and I remember trying to share with my classmates who Boa was.
405.02	412.419	But of course I did mention in my background story where I did want to try to reject it, but I respected my parents
412.419	418.22	too much to reject my Korean heritage, so I was very proud about it.
418.22	421.32	This definitely changed throughout the years. So
421.32	425.91	In elementary, junior high, and high school the stereotype was, 
425.91	431.79	Asians are smart. So I knew for a fact that I wasn't born with the brains. My brother is actually
431.79	433.02	really, really intelligent,
433.02	439.25	and I just kind of like got the grades that I needed, and Abe just went like above and beyond.
439.25	442.55	But I definitely knew I wasn't like smart compared to my brother.
442.55	446.18	But because all of my classmates kept telling me that Asians are smart, 
446.18	448.26	I would work extra hard.
448.26	452.25	Like I mentioned before, I was the first child in my family.
452.25	455.78	Like, I was the first born. My parents were both from Korea, 
455.78	460.19	they went to college in Korea, and they didn't really... Like, they weren't too strict with me.
460.19	466.7	But I feel like they became strict with my brother because I would be like, no mom, dad Abe has to do this this and that.
466.7	470.27	So my brother always jokes around saying that I am his second mother.
470.27	474.45	But yeah one of the stereotypes that I did struggle with was like, Asians are smart,
474.45	478.65	but that actually motivated me to take the classes that I took and
478.65	482.42	get the grades that I got. When I went to college at UC Berkeley,
482.42	486.36	that's when I met the most Asians. So like I mentioned before, 
486.36	489.74	I went to a school where I was the only Asian in the beginning, 
489.74	495.51	and then I think I can count like how many Asians attended my school with my hands. Um, 
495.51	502.56	th- like in elementary school. And then it i- like obviously grew, the Asian community grew in our neighborhood.
502.56	504.21	But in college
504.21	507.66	I never met so many Korean Americans, 
507.66	512.4	Koreans, like Asians overall. And I didn't really feel a
512.4	515.16	stereotype because we were all the same.
515.16	522.57	But then when I moved to Korea there was another stereotype that I had to deal with which is being korean american.
522.57	526.17	How do I explain this kind of situation?
526.17	532.71	People would kinda assume that I had a lot of money for speaking English, but that was definitely not the case.
532.71	538.88	And then some people would just kind of point out that like, oh, I'm being very ignorant, even though
538.88	543.6	I knew Korean. So like I remember like my friend and I, we were eating at this restaurant
543.6	546.48	and like the ladies right next to us we_unc were like, oh my gosh,
546.48	550.68	she's so Kore- She looks Korean, but she's not speaking any Korean, 
550.68	555.329	and that's like a shameful thing. But then when I was paying for the food,
555.329	557.92	I would speak in like Korean, and they were like whoa.
557.92	561.3	So like I always felt like I had to prove myself that like, oh
561.3	566.319	I really try my best to learn both of the cultures. So
566.319	568.149	yeah.
568.149	573.269	Yes, I can. And I'm nowhere where I want to be, because I didn't go to school here, 
573.269	578.74	but I can read speak and write Korean.
578.74	580.48	Growing up I
580.48	587.86	learned how to be an adult a lot quicker than most. Because my parents needed help
587.86	592.21	translating documents. And every time they needed to call like um 
592.21	596.82	I don't know like an electric bill company or a gas company
596.82	600.94	I had to do it with them sitting right next to me. So I
600.94	605.82	remember like in the beginning, I liked doing it, but then I also got angry every time
605.82	606.61	I had to do this.
606.61	610.54	But you know like that kind of got me closer to my mom.
610.54	616.96	Because you know she was dealing with all the finances and things like that, so I think growing up
616.96	623.58	Korean american, like my relationship with my like parents, it was always like a close one. 
623.58	629.82	I am very proud of being korean american, and I was always proud of being korean american. I love the food
629.82	631.47	I love the music.
631.47	634.89	I love the films. Are like you guys watch Joan Day.
634.89	644.27	And this is actually one of like my biggest goals is to share Korea in a more realistic view.
644.27	646.7	Definitely enjoying best of both worlds.
646.7	652.37	In America there are diners, and in Korea there are pojangmachas_cs. And I identify with both.
652.37	655.9	Both has to do with food actually. But you get what I'm trying to say here.
655.9	658.68	So that was my story about growing up
658.68	659.88	korean american.
659.88	664.79	And of course, I answered the questions that Amy created for the asian american tag.
664.79	665.84	If you guys
665.84	668.03	identify with any of this, please share your
668.03	671.66	stories in the comment section below, because I would love to read about it.

675.8	679.42	here are the people that I tagged to do this Asian American tag.
679.42	683.16	I would love to watch my friends share their experiences, 
683.16	684.5	so bug them about it too.
