2.83	6.089	Hi everyone welcome back to my channel and in today's video
6.089	10.11	I will be sharing with you guys something that I have been wanting to share on my channel
10.11	14.28	And it's about my life as a Korean American so
14.28	17.039	Amy actually tagged me to do the Asian American tag
17.039	20.89	but I wanted to do it a little differently by sharing with you guys my
20.89	26.859	Background story first before getting into those details, so I'm gonna start my story now
26.859	31.62	So if you didn't know I was born and raised in Los Angeles, California
31.62	35.14	and when I was about three and when my brother was born
35.14	38.68	our family we moved to South Korea because my
38.68	43.649	Grandpa was diagnosed with cancer and my parents wanted us to spend time with him
43.649	48.3	And I remember going to preschool, in Korea
48.3	54.25	And you know I just grew up like learning how to speak Korean and that's all I knew
54.25	59.07	But then when I was five I moved back, and then I started attending school
59.07	65.08	and I was the only Asian in my school so
65.08	70.89	Obviously I looked very different, and I didn't know the language so I mean as a kid
70.89	74.729	I'm kind of like very similar to what I am now
74.729	80.53	I'm very extroverted, and I love meeting new people so I didn't really have a problem with making friends
80.53	85.96	But of course there was that language barrier, but I don't really remember like traumatic
85.96	90.42	Experiences like from kindergarten at all so in first grade
90.42	95.38	That's when I kind of realized that I was different because during reading time
95.38	102.34	I was always asked to you know come out of the room and then go to another classroom and
102.34	107.13	Do ESL courses with another teacher and you know that was very helpful for me
107.13	112.96	But I also hated it because I felt very different from my classmates, and they would always be like oh
112.96	115.74	It's like eleven o'clock, its time for you to leave the classroom
115.74	120.04	so that actually motivated me to study harder and
120.04	122.56	Actually, I'll be going into details of this later
122.56	127.98	But every time people pointed out that I was different or like a certain stereotype
127.98	130.2	I would always work extra hard
130.2	136.05	just so that I would no longer be in ESL and that I could get better grades and things like that so
136.05	139.11	Yeah in first grade I had to deal with
139.11	143.9	Feeling different because I would always have to step out of the classroom for those ESL courses
143.9	151.4	and then I also remember a time when my like classmates they were looking through a magazine and
151.4	153.769	It was a Britney Spears magazine
153.769	160.17	and I remember not knowing who she was and my classmates made fun of me for not knowing who she was and
160.17	162.41	Like I grew up liking kpop
162.41	165.8	So I'm a very OG kpop fan
165.8	170.34	like I listened to it back when Fin.K.L was around Baby VOX
170.34	175.319	GOD, Boa, Jang Nara like those were like
175.319	177.12	Those are my idols
177.12	178.95	so for them to hate on me for
178.95	183.019	Not knowing who Britney Spears was like that was really sad on my end
183.019	188.94	but I remember like going to like Ralph's and Albertsons just to study the
188.94	191.997	celebrities because I had no idea who any of them were
191.997	193.739	so 2nd grade comes around and
193.739	198.41	A Korean moved to our district, and I was like whoa that's really cool
198.41	199.92	And I remember teachers
199.92	201.38	Asking me to come out of the classroom
201.38	205.41	Just to help her because I knew how to speak both English and Korean now
205.41	212.01	So I felt really good about doing that because for the first time I felt a sense of worth
212.01	215.04	Because now people were praising me for
215.04	217.29	knowing Korean and Korean culture
217.29	222.349	So I remember for like a whole year the teachers would always let me sit with this girl
222.349	226.46	And I would always translate for her help her do her work and things like that
226.46	234.5	but then like later um I realized that she didn't want to do anything Korean anymore so I
234.5	236.13	kind of felt
236.13	237.94	How do I explain this
237.94	242.78	so I remember this girl kind of avoiding me because she just didn't want to practice Korean anymore
242.78	246.049	And I remember coming back home, and I told my brother
246.049	250.19	I was like Abe from now on we're gonna only speak English at home
250.19	253.43	And we started doing that to our parents as well
253.43	259.2	And I remember my mom feeling so sad afterwards because if you think about it now
259.2	265.49	if I think about it now my parents both sacrificed their comfortable life in Korea
265.49	270.78	To move to America for me and my brother and even after we moved
270.78	273.24	We still came back after
273.24	278.69	Two years of living in Korea because my parents wanted us to have an education in America
278.69	285.56	so I felt terrible about that and I also got in trouble for trying to only speak English at home and then after that I
285.56	290.81	Was like you know what, I'm just gonna embrace Korean and at home it will just be Korean and outside of it
290.81	294.78	I will just speak English so I always kept it
294.78	297.56	Like I never shared this information with my friends at school
297.56	302.02	Just because I don't know I was always embarrassed about being Korean
302.02	303.38	so there's a little bit of my foundation now
303.38	307.21	I'm going to answer some questions from the asian-american tag
307.21	309.88	I'm korean-american
309.88	312.19	My parents were both born in Seoul South Korea
312.19	315.61	And then they moved to America and then I was born
315.61	321.79	So I guess I would be one point five generation or second generation my uncle always tells me of second generation
321.79	325.889	But I always feel like I am one point five
325.889	328.289	I kind of shared this in my background story
328.289	333.18	But definitely when my classmates were flipping through the magazine and talking about Britney Spears
333.18	340.9	I knew there was something different about that and also none of my classmates looked like me we had different eyes we had different hair colors and
340.9	344.68	Yeah, I knew for a fact that I was different, but also
344.68	350.279	When we all started to learn about Asian culture in history class I remember people were like Oh
350.279	356.56	What kind of Asian were you again were you Chinese or Japanese and when I would answer I'm Korean no one knew
356.56	359.279	What Korea was and I was like oh
359.279	364.629	That's so strange like I'm Korean and I know the language and the music and everything
364.629	366.75	But I felt kind of different there
366.75	371.199	and then when we learned about Korea people would ask me are you north or south and
371.199	371.699	actually
371.699	376.24	I went back home and asked my mom like am I north or in my south korean and my mom
376.24	382.5	Answered that I am South Korean because both my parents were born in Seoul South Korea, but later
382.5	390.25	I also learned that my grandpa like one of my grandparents he is from North Korea, and then I got to learn more about
390.25	392.319	his story and
392.319	397.43	His testimony things like that
397.43	398.36	Even as a child
398.36	405.02	I was always very proud to be Korean and I remember trying to share with my classmates who Boa was
405.02	412.419	But of course I did mention in my background story where I did want to try to reject it, but I respected my parents
412.419	418.22	Too much to reject my Korean heritage, so I was very proud about it
418.22	421.32	This definitely changed throughout the years so
421.32	425.91	In elementary, junior high and high school the stereotype was
425.91	431.79	Asians are smart so I knew for a fact that I wasn't born with the brains my brother is actually
431.79	433.02	really really intelligent
433.02	439.25	And I just kind of like got the grades that I needed and Abe just went like above and beyond
439.25	442.55	But I definitely knew I wasn't like smart compared to my brother
442.55	446.18	But because all of my classmates kept telling me that Asians are smart
446.18	448.26	I would work extra hard
448.26	452.25	Like I mentioned before I was the first child in my family
452.25	455.78	Like I was the first born my parents were both from Korea
455.78	460.19	They went to college in Korea, and they didn't really like they weren't too strict with me
460.19	466.7	but I feel like they became strict with my brother because I would be like no mom dad Abe has to do this this and that
466.7	470.27	so my brother always jokes around saying that I am his second mother
470.27	474.45	But yeah one of the stereotypes that I did struggle with was like Asians are smart
474.45	478.65	but that actually motivated me to take the classes that I took and
478.65	482.42	Get the grades that I got when I went to college at UC Berkeley
482.42	486.36	That's when I met the most Asians so like I mentioned before
486.36	489.74	I went to a school where I was the only Asian in the beginning
489.74	495.51	And then I think I can count like how many Asians attended my school with my hands
495.51	502.56	Like in elementary school, and then it like obviously grew the Asian community grew in our neighborhood
502.56	504.21	but in college
504.21	507.66	I never met so many Korean Americans
507.66	512.4	Koreans like Asians overall and I didn't really feel a
512.4	515.16	Stereotype because we were all the same
515.16	522.57	But then when I moved to Korea there was another stereotype that I had to deal with which is being korean-american
522.57	526.17	How do I explain this kind of situation?
526.17	532.71	People would kind of assume that I had a lot of money for speaking English, but that was definitely not the case
532.71	538.88	And then some people would just kind of point out that like oh, I'm being very ignorant even though
538.88	543.6	I knew Korean so like I remember like my friend and I we were eating at this restaurant
543.6	546.48	And like the ladies right next to us. We were like oh my gosh
546.48	550.68	She's so Korean. She looks Korean, but she's not speaking any Korean
550.68	555.329	An that's like a shameful thing, but then when I was paying for the food
555.329	557.92	I would speak in like Korean and they were like whoa
557.92	561.3	So like I always felt like I had to prove myself that like oh
561.3	566.319	I really try my best to learn both of the cultures so
566.319	568.149	Yeah
568.149	573.269	Yes, I can and I'm nowhere where I want to be because I didn't go to school here
573.269	578.74	But I can read speak and write Korean
578.74	580.48	Growing up I
580.48	587.86	Learned how to be an adult a lot quicker than most because my parents needed help
587.86	592.21	Translating documents and every time they needed to call like
592.21	596.82	I don't know like an electric bill company or a gas company
596.82	600.94	I had to do it with them sitting right next to me so I
600.94	605.82	Remember like in the beginning. I liked doing it, but then I also got angry every time
605.82	606.61	I had to do this
606.61	610.54	But you know like that kind of got me closer to my mom
610.54	616.96	Because you know she was dealing with all the finances and things like that so I think growing up
616.96	623.58	Korean-american like my relationship with my like parents. It was always like a close one
623.58	629.82	I am very proud of being korean-american and I was always proud of being korean-american. I love the food
629.82	631.47	I love the music
631.47	634.89	I love the films are like you guys watch Joan Day
634.89	644.27	And this is actually one of like my biggest goals is to share Korea in a more realistic view
644.27	646.7	Definitely enjoying best of both worlds
646.7	652.37	in America there are diners and in Korea there are snack carts and I identify with both
652.37	655.9	Both has to do with food actually, but you get what I'm trying to say here
655.9	658.68	So that was my story about growing up
658.68	659.88	korean-american
659.88	664.79	and of course I answered the questions that Amy created for the asian-american tag
664.79	665.84	if you guys
665.84	668.03	identify with any of this please share your
