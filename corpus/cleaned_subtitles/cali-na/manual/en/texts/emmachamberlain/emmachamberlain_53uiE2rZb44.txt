aesthetic you know just kidding um what is your star sign my star sign is a gemini it actually literally I am such my sign like every aspect of a Gemini is me like talking too much That's basically it favorite music genre I don't really know I know which ones I don't like I don't really like Pop music I'm not the biggest country music fans but I like you know alternative kind of Indie stuff You know get the like hipsters well um who is your favorite musician So I like a bunch of different musicians like if you're talking about like I like 50s music I like 70s and 80s music so like with 50s I like Doris Day and Bobby Vinton when it comes to 70s and 80s music I like Elton John the beatles like I don't even know like like a bunch of different stuff But like recent artists like new or artists

like a fake sushi fans but whatever I like to smoothies favorite drink okay three number one My strawberry Smoothie that I make that's just strawberries lemon juice and water and then blend it up And it turns into a slushie really good another thing I like It's sparkling water with lime squeezed into it really good Then last not least my favorite drink of all time iced almond milk latte It's not

drink like my favorite snack is those strawberry smoothies that I drink where's just strawberries Lemon in water really good favorite holiday I like Christmas Because I'm basic I mean like I don't know every other holiday just seems to be like not as awesome as Christmas the best vibes The most like I don't know I slept that time of the year Christmas favorite Pastime I Like I mean you know exercising taking that editing videos filming videos taking more naps So yeah my main form of pastime is like doing videos right now and go to the gym Favorite sport probably to my favorites I did competitive cheer which I think is a sport some people You know don't come at me but like I think cheers the sport when it's competitive And so probably that or track because I did track This year at school and I really liked it What is something You are talented at personally I don't like this question because like I don't know like I don't really know if I'm talented at anything because like you're your own Worst Critic so like I kind of think I suck at everything But like that's kind of human nature so I don't know when I'm talented at honestly I don't have an answer for that What is something you wish you were talented at I mean I wish I was talented everything I wish I was a good saying I wish I was like a good dancer I wish that I was I don't know I wish I was good at a lot of things I wish I was like a really fast runner I don't know I wish I was talented that everything honestly are you competitive Ii It like depends like I can be super competitive in certain situations where I just like need to win but then other times I'm like it I don't really mind moving so it's like it's kind of in between describe yourself in a single sentence Oh my God This is getting really hard um I don't I don't know how to like put it new sens I think I'm like pretty hard working and like you know like if I get my head okay just mechanism it if I like get set on something like I will not stop till I like get that thing and That's a sense about me What is the best compliment you ever received I think whatever people say like I'm a really like nice person or my kind person or people say that to me That's like probably the nicest compliment I could get because it's something I like strive to do is like be a kind person and be nice or whatever So when people say that I Succeed at that it really makes me super happy so probably that what are some of your bad habits Probably like overthinking a lot I definitely think about things like way too much I overanalyze every single situation ever that's probably probably um favourite things about yourself I would say is like what I said earlier how I like don't stop until I like succeed at whatever I wanted to see that and Obviously sometimes I don't succeed But if I like reach the end or like I push myself to like the highest Point that was like successful point I can get to probably that what is on the top of your bucket list honestly I don't really have like specific things on my bucket list But I know for sure I want to I definitely want to travel more I mean that's like a really like cliche answer But like go outside of the country or maybe go to like I don't know bali looks really cool kind of Wanna Go there like just like really like unique places Just like explore more you know three long-term goals honestly I would just say like overall I'm not even going to say three because I only have one just like Wherever I'm at in my life at any point be like really Happy and like just genuinely happy whether that means like whatever that means in the other Aspects of my life like I don't care about that I don't care what I end up doing is that except just overall being happy and also really cliche but like The truth three short-term global we're not that short-term that would probably mean today And that would mean try to not take it off and then try to not drink more than three coffees within one hour It's hard and I don't know if I'm gonna succeed But I think that I might be able to so I'll let you know What are you doing today to accomplish those goals well I haven't done anything for either of those today taking a nap wise it is currently twelve pm And I have not taken a nap yet So we are going strong in that aspect the coffee thing I already had two today so I'm not doing so well on that one but I think I think if I really control myself And I can wait another like twenty minutes I might be able to only have one more coffee today So we'll see What is your biggest accomplishment becoming more confident and happy and summing that sexuality a big accomplishment although starting a YouTube channel because I always wanted to and It was kind of an interesting story about how it happened so one day I will do a story time and tell you why I started youtube because it's actually really interesting But I had a channel a long time ago like in like fourth grade and I did like outfits on there And it was like horrible and I can't find those videos anymore Luckily like literally thank God They were so embarrassing But I'm probably also like starting a youtube again because I always wanted to and now I'm doing it So that's cool What didn't I feel first date for you Okay Well I don't go on dates very often Sadly This is also kind of cliche I don't like things like going to the movies I don't like things like a dinner Because I just like really boring to me like just so like awkward well with a movie It's just awkward because you can't talk and it's just weird and then do you like went to dinner You're like Force like look at the other person in the face and then they have to watch you eat I don't know do something about that's just too boring um something like really fun like in adventure like Driving somewhere kind of far away like driving to the beach or something like swimming in the ocean at like 200 am Or something okay That's actually good Not really fun something like that It would be like really memorable and like special so what is something you look for in a partner I'm sixteen and I have basically no experience in this topic But I would say just like somebody who is like willing to put in people effort into the relationship But also like somebody who you can trust in like the trust is mutual so like you're not worried about like where they are all the time or who they're talking to or whatever like Somebody like trust me enough that like I could like hang out with another guy friend and like the guy wouldn't care you know also Just somebody who's like genuinely kind and like thoughtful of me and my feelings because I'm like emo I'm kidding um but like yes so he's like really like considers your feelings I'm bad at this stuff Who is your role model I would say like definitely my parents I mean for sure like that's an obvious one I was something like a really inspirational person is like Casey nice - a youtuber He's a great person I don't know He's really inspirational to me which one of your parents Are you more like depends like really similar to my dad because we like the same music We like doing the same things he has a Youtube channel too We both like to like go Like explore in the City and like you know I get coffee and stuff except I think we have a lot of like I also think I'm aligned with my mom because you know we both like enjoy it sort Of women parts of like life like shopping and like stuff like that So it kind of depends which one of your parents are you closest to this is also kind of like I don't have one or the other I'm close with both equally in like different ways because I'm an only child Only children get really close with their parents so both honestly What is the last book you read um I don't read like I genuinely do not read ever because I hate it I don't know why I just don't like reading unless I find like a really really good book that I like really love I Just don't read so I don't have an answer for that What is your favorite fairy tale pfft I don't freaking know like I ever like what what even is a fairy tale like I mean I know but like I know I don't Have an answer What is your favorite quote I hate reading quotes out loud like something about that is so corny to me But let me look at my pinterest on my quote board And I'll just read one that I find how the keep it simple good things are coming That's a good one remember that kids keep doing that good mindset You know favorite subject in school probably science It's the most interesting to me It's also one of the hardest classes in school for me but I do enjoy science so probably that I like biology more than chemistry definitely subject you were best at Honestly like depends because like I don't think I'm very like it depends on like if you mean like which I personally think I strive at or like which one has a better grade like that's just different but like I think I'm Okay at like history and stuff like that but I absolutely hate it So it's like I dunno like I'm probably better at history and English than I am at like math and science But like I enjoy math and science more Don't ask me why favorite teacher honestly I don't have an answer I liked all of my teachers in Elementary school and the second I got to high school the relationships Weren't as good in high school and I'm still in high school Yeah it's just a lot more on the line a lot more tension So that's that Who has left the biggest impact on your life probably my parents because They've always been there my whole entire life So there's really nobody else in this entire universe who could have more of an impact on me than my parents because I've been around Them my whole life and I'm an only child and they're like the biggest influence on me What app do you use most Probably Instagram or Visco What piece of technology could you not live without Honestly I don't just have one Phone laptop very important and camera also very important But if for some reason I couldn't have a camera the phone as the camera so probably phoned and laptop What countries Have you visited well I've been out of the country twice I went to Ireland and then I went to the Dominican Republic What countries would you LIKE to visit If it was up to me I would visit every country in the entire universe so Most embarrassing memory Oh my God okay This is really good So basically like I did cello in fifth grade um which is weird considering I literally four foot six inches and probably weighed 50 pounds and was basically the size of a cello But anyway it was the end of the school year and we had like our last recital thing parents were there Grandparents were there uncles aunts everybody you can think of was there The crowd was going Wild when we finally finished our fifth grade orchestra performance and all of us sucked We probably sounded like actual crap considering we were literally fifth graders and Barely had brains developed yet just kidding that's not true But you know what I mean um anyway so obviously it at the end of the year they gave out awards for people who are really outstanding So I was sitting there in my chair You know I wasn't expecting to get an award because well I just didn't play like I literally move my fingers and just like lightly put my bow the bow I'll insert a Bow across like the thing I wouldn't even make any noise with my actual cello I would just kind of like fake it the whole time so I wasn't really expecting An award because I really didn't deserve it basically I heard our conductor guy say like all Of the people who play cello stand up That's why I heard in my brain okay I don't know why I've heard this because that is not what he said he said blank name stand up I thought he said all the people who play cello stand up but it turned out He said like This cello player stand up and it said her name and then she stood up well I stood up with her But I didn't win the award tho Okay moving on How many relationships have you been in haha ONE in Fifth grade so but I mean I guess in you're sixteen you don't need to be in a relationship so I guess it's fine but I'm No I'm just kidding I'm good Single life is the best life ya know If you could give your younger self any advice what would it be You will never regret being kind one thing that you know now that you wish you would have known as a kid that's like the same question and I'll say it again You will never regret being kind ever Okay Like I just remember how me and everybody was in Middle school to each other and it was just the norm you know Second grade self girl would steal your sticker and talk about a freaking fight and like at this point in my life I've learned you know just be the bigger person always be kind no matter what anybody says or does to you being kind you will Never regret it okay Tea or coffee Okay coffee I'm sorry That's just like not even a question I don't even Like that we don't even need to discuss it okay coffee How tall are you I am five three and a half but I think I'm 5'4 now soooo I don't know Cats or dogs um Dogs I mean I don't know I just like dogs better Sorry All you cat people no hate I have cats and dogs so like yeah but dogs are just better I feel like everybody who doesn't like dogs doesn't have one So like that's the answer to that Funniest moment throughout school Honestly I feel like all moments in school are absolute hell Rather than anything funny I usually am not laughing during school I'm usually crying Hysterically constantly because of how much I actually despise being there if I think of one later I'll let you know But like for right now all my memories are just absolute terror Are you in slash have you gone to college I am going to be a junior next year stone no What was your worst subject in high school um while I'm in high school now and worse subject honestly I think my least favorite would have to be English I just think it's so boring But I think the one that I was like the worst outlet had the worst grade was probably like chemistry But like I actually really liked chemistry so it's kind of like a love-hate favorite animal okay I really I really like all animals I think it's easier to say the ones that I don't like I have a actual phobia like no joke dead-ass phobia of Caterpillars I hate them but I don't even like I don't care about snakes I spiders or if you like if they're near me I freaked out but is there like ten feet away from me I don't care um like I'm cool Doll that Caterpillars just Really make me lose it like I just I can't if they're near me if I see a picture of one like I will Initiate I don't know I don't know it's mental What sports do you play So have you played well earlier I mentioned that I did cheer and track but I also did okay This is going to take a while I did karate Taekwondo when I was like six so that happened so I did ice

found it so I'll insert a picture here but it was this series And it's like if you're reading this it's too late and no not talking about the drake album cover I'm talking about these books and I was
