em	emmachamberlain	196.44	200.819	Lemon in water really good favorite holiday I like Christmas
em	emmachamberlain	200.819	202.519	Because I'm basic
em	emmachamberlain	202.519	208.079	I mean like I don't know every other holiday just seems to be like not as awesome as Christmas the best vibes
em	emmachamberlain	208.079	213.449	The most like I don't know I slept that time of the year Christmas favorite Pastime I
em	emmachamberlain	213.449	218.22	Like I mean you know exercising taking that
em	emmachamberlain	218.22	221.759	editing videos filming videos taking more naps
em	emmachamberlain	221.759	226.62	So yeah my main form of pastime is like doing videos right now and go to the gym
em	emmachamberlain	226.62	231.109	Favorite sport probably to my favorites I did competitive cheer which I think is a sport some people
em	emmachamberlain	231.109	234.829	You know don't come at me but like I think cheers the sport when it's competitive
em	emmachamberlain	234.829	239.4	And so probably that or track because I did track
em	emmachamberlain	239.4	242.18	This year at school and I really liked it What is something
em	emmachamberlain	242.18	243.949	You are talented at personally
em	emmachamberlain	243.949	250.409	I don't like this question because like I don't know like I don't really know if I'm talented at anything because like you're your own
em	emmachamberlain	250.409	253.59	Worst Critic so like I kind of think I suck at everything
em	emmachamberlain	253.59	258.38	But like that's kind of human nature so I don't know when I'm talented at honestly I don't have an answer for that
em	emmachamberlain	258.38	262.159	What is something you wish you were talented at I mean I wish I was talented everything
em	emmachamberlain	262.159	265.27	I wish I was a good saying I wish I was like a good dancer
em	emmachamberlain	265.27	268.42	I wish that I was I don't know I wish I was good at a lot of things
em	emmachamberlain	268.42	272.24	I wish I was like a really fast runner I don't know I wish I was
em	emmachamberlain	272.24	275.15	talented that everything honestly are you competitive Ii
em	emmachamberlain	275.15	281.44	It like depends like I can be super competitive in certain situations where I just like need to win but then other times
em	emmachamberlain	281.44	286.48	I'm like it I don't really mind moving so it's like it's kind of in between describe yourself in a single sentence
em	emmachamberlain	286.48	290.23	Oh my God This is getting really hard um I don't I don't know how to like put it new sens
em	emmachamberlain	290.23	294.04	I think I'm like pretty hard working and like you know like if I get my head okay
em	emmachamberlain	294.04	300.62	just mechanism it if I like get set on something like I will not stop till I like get that thing and
em	emmachamberlain	300.62	305.02	That's a sense about me What is the best compliment you ever received
em	emmachamberlain	305.02	309.29	I think whatever people say like I'm a really like nice person or my kind person or people say that to me
em	emmachamberlain	309.29	311.77	That's like probably the nicest compliment
em	emmachamberlain	311.77	316.97	I could get because it's something I like strive to do is like be a kind person and be nice or whatever
em	emmachamberlain	316.97	318.92	So when people say that I
em	emmachamberlain	318.92	325.09	Succeed at that it really makes me super happy so probably that what are some of your bad habits
em	emmachamberlain	325.09	328.93	Probably like overthinking a lot I definitely think about things like way too much
em	emmachamberlain	328.93	334.58	I overanalyze every single situation ever that's probably probably um favourite things about yourself
em	emmachamberlain	334.58	339.22	I would say is like what I said earlier how I like don't stop until I like succeed at whatever
em	emmachamberlain	339.22	340.94	I wanted to see that and
em	emmachamberlain	340.94	342.52	Obviously sometimes I don't succeed
em	emmachamberlain	342.52	347.45	But if I like reach the end or like I push myself to like the highest
em	emmachamberlain	347.45	353.56	Point that was like successful point I can get to probably that what is on the top of your bucket list honestly
em	emmachamberlain	353.56	355.91	I don't really have like specific things on my bucket list
em	emmachamberlain	355.91	360.34	But I know for sure I want to I definitely want to travel more
em	emmachamberlain	360.34	362.23	I mean that's like a really like cliche answer
em	emmachamberlain	362.23	368.41	But like go outside of the country or maybe go to like I don't know bali looks really cool kind of Wanna
em	emmachamberlain	368.41	375.19	Go there like just like really like unique places Just like explore more you know three long-term goals honestly
em	emmachamberlain	375.19	376.48	I would just say like overall
em	emmachamberlain	376.48	379.22	I'm not even going to say three because I only have one just like
em	emmachamberlain	379.22	383.18	Wherever I'm at in my life at any point be like really
em	emmachamberlain	383.18	388.94	Happy and like just genuinely happy whether that means like whatever that means in the other
em	emmachamberlain	388.94	390.88	Aspects of my life like I don't care about that
em	emmachamberlain	390.88	397.579	I don't care what I end up doing is that except just overall being happy and also really cliche but like
em	emmachamberlain	397.579	402.129	The truth three short-term global we're not that short-term that would probably mean today
em	emmachamberlain	402.129	408.979	And that would mean try to not take it off and then try to not drink more than three coffees within one hour
em	emmachamberlain	408.979	410.889	It's hard and I don't know if I'm gonna succeed
em	emmachamberlain	410.889	414.349	But I think that I might be able to so I'll let you know
em	emmachamberlain	414.349	417.069	What are you doing today to accomplish those goals well
em	emmachamberlain	417.069	422.859	I haven't done anything for either of those today taking a nap wise it is currently twelve pm
em	emmachamberlain	422.859	430.699	And I have not taken a nap yet So we are going strong in that aspect the coffee thing I already had two today so
em	emmachamberlain	430.699	435.789	I'm not doing so well on that one but I think I think if I really control myself
em	emmachamberlain	435.789	442.089	And I can wait another like twenty minutes I might be able to only have one more coffee today So we'll see
em	emmachamberlain	442.089	443.899	What is your biggest accomplishment
em	emmachamberlain	443.899	451.249	becoming more confident and happy and summing that sexuality a big accomplishment although starting a YouTube channel because I always wanted to and
em	emmachamberlain	451.249	454.539	It was kind of an interesting story about how it happened so one day
em	emmachamberlain	454.539	457.579	I will do a story time and tell you why I started youtube because it's actually really interesting
em	emmachamberlain	457.579	463.36	But I had a channel a long time ago like in like fourth grade and I did like outfits on there
em	emmachamberlain	463.36	467.059	And it was like horrible and I can't find those videos anymore
em	emmachamberlain	467.059	469.299	Luckily like literally thank God They were so embarrassing
em	emmachamberlain	469.299	475.149	But I'm probably also like starting a youtube again because I always wanted to and now I'm doing it So that's cool
em	emmachamberlain	475.149	481.399	What didn't I feel first date for you Okay Well I don't go on dates very often
em	emmachamberlain	481.399	482.689	Sadly
em	emmachamberlain	482.689	487.729	This is also kind of cliche I don't like things like going to the movies I don't like things like a dinner
em	emmachamberlain	487.729	491.829	Because I just like really boring to me like just so like awkward well with a movie
em	emmachamberlain	491.829	495.549	It's just awkward because you can't talk and it's just weird and then do you like went to dinner
em	emmachamberlain	495.549	499.509	You're like Force like look at the other person in the face and then they have to watch you eat
em	emmachamberlain	499.509	505.519	I don't know do something about that's just too boring um something like really fun like in adventure like
em	emmachamberlain	505.519	510.999	Driving somewhere kind of far away like driving to the beach or something like swimming in the ocean at like 200 am
em	emmachamberlain	510.999	513.969	Or something okay That's actually good Not really fun something like that
em	emmachamberlain	513.969	519.769	It would be like really memorable and like special so what is something you look for in a partner
em	emmachamberlain	519.769	524.3	I'm sixteen and I have basically no experience in this topic
em	emmachamberlain	524.3	530.07	But I would say just like somebody who is like willing to put in people effort into the relationship
em	emmachamberlain	530.07	535.7	But also like somebody who you can trust in like the trust is mutual so like you're not worried about like where they are all
em	emmachamberlain	535.7	538.23	the time or who they're talking to or whatever like
em	emmachamberlain	538.23	543.71	Somebody like trust me enough that like I could like hang out with another guy friend and like the guy wouldn't care you know also
em	emmachamberlain	543.71	549.21	Just somebody who's like genuinely kind and like thoughtful of me and my feelings because I'm like emo
em	emmachamberlain	549.21	555.38	I'm kidding um but like yes so he's like really like considers your feelings I'm bad at this stuff Who is your role model
em	emmachamberlain	555.38	559.49	I would say like definitely my parents I mean for sure like that's an obvious one
em	emmachamberlain	559.49	564.02	I was something like a really inspirational person is like Casey nice - a youtuber He's a great person
em	emmachamberlain	564.02	566.28	I don't know He's really inspirational to me which one of your parents
em	emmachamberlain	566.28	570.41	Are you more like depends like really similar to my dad because we like the same music
em	emmachamberlain	570.41	573.08	We like doing the same things he has a Youtube channel too
em	emmachamberlain	573.08	574.29	We both like to like go
em	emmachamberlain	574.29	578.06	Like explore in the City and like you know I get coffee and stuff except
em	emmachamberlain	578.06	583.13	I think we have a lot of like I also think I'm aligned with my mom because you know we both like enjoy it sort
em	emmachamberlain	583.13	586.88	Of women parts of like life like shopping and like stuff like that
em	emmachamberlain	586.88	591.14	So it kind of depends which one of your parents are you closest to this is also kind of like
em	emmachamberlain	591.14	597.32	I don't have one or the other I'm close with both equally in like different ways because I'm an only child
em	emmachamberlain	597.32	600.74	Only children get really close with their parents so both honestly
em	emmachamberlain	600.74	606.92	What is the last book you read um I don't read like I genuinely do not read ever because I hate it
em	emmachamberlain	606.92	612.18	I don't know why I just don't like reading unless I find like a really really good book that I like really love I
em	emmachamberlain	612.18	617.28	Just don't read so I don't have an answer for that What is your favorite fairy tale
em	emmachamberlain	617.28	618.24	pfft
em	emmachamberlain	618.24	623.36	I don't freaking know like I ever like what what even is a fairy tale like I mean I know but like I know I don't
em	emmachamberlain	623.36	623.75	Have an answer
em	emmachamberlain	623.75	629.64	What is your favorite quote I hate reading quotes out loud like something about that is so corny to me
em	emmachamberlain	629.64	632.15	But let me look at my pinterest on my quote board
em	emmachamberlain	632.15	636.15	And I'll just read one that I find how the keep it simple good things are coming
em	emmachamberlain	636.15	642.14	That's a good one remember that kids keep doing that good mindset You know favorite subject in school probably science
em	emmachamberlain	642.14	644.43	It's the most interesting to me
em	emmachamberlain	644.43	653.01	It's also one of the hardest classes in school for me but I do enjoy science so probably that I like biology more than chemistry
em	emmachamberlain	653.01	655.11	definitely subject you were best at
em	emmachamberlain	655.11	660.36	Honestly like depends because like I don't think I'm very like it depends on like if you mean like which I personally think I
em	emmachamberlain	660.36	666.42	strive at or like which one has a better grade like that's just different but like I think I'm
em	emmachamberlain	666.42	670.17	Okay at like history and stuff like that but I absolutely hate it
em	emmachamberlain	670.17	675.08	So it's like I dunno like I'm probably better at history and English than I am at like math and science
em	emmachamberlain	675.08	677.34	But like I enjoy math and science more
em	emmachamberlain	677.34	682.16	Don't ask me why favorite teacher honestly I don't have an answer
em	emmachamberlain	682.16	688.5	I liked all of my teachers in Elementary school and the second I got to high school
em	emmachamberlain	688.5	690.06	the relationships
em	emmachamberlain	690.06	692.34	Weren't as good in high school and I'm still in high school
em	emmachamberlain	692.34	700.64	Yeah it's just a lot more on the line a lot more tension So that's that Who has left the biggest impact on your life
em	emmachamberlain	700.64	703.26	probably my parents because
em	emmachamberlain	703.26	704.97	They've always been there my whole entire life
em	emmachamberlain	704.97	710.87	So there's really nobody else in this entire universe who could have more of an impact on me than my parents because I've been around
em	emmachamberlain	710.87	714.26	Them my whole life and I'm an only child and they're like the biggest influence on me
em	emmachamberlain	714.26	719.81	What app do you use most Probably Instagram or Visco What piece of technology could you not live without
em	emmachamberlain	719.81	725.9	Honestly I don't just have one Phone laptop very important and camera also very important
em	emmachamberlain	725.9	731.27	But if for some reason I couldn't have a camera the phone as the camera so probably phoned and laptop What countries
em	emmachamberlain	731.27	736.53	Have you visited well I've been out of the country twice I went to Ireland and then I went to the Dominican Republic
em	emmachamberlain	736.53	739.25	What countries would you LIKE to visit If it was up to me
em	emmachamberlain	739.25	745.64	I would visit every country in the entire universe so Most embarrassing memory Oh my God okay
em	emmachamberlain	745.64	750.92	This is really good So basically like I did cello in fifth grade um which is weird considering
em	emmachamberlain	750.92	756.68	I literally four foot six inches and probably weighed 50 pounds and was basically the size of a cello
em	emmachamberlain	756.68	757.76	But anyway
em	emmachamberlain	757.76	762.66	it was the end of the school year and we had like our last recital thing parents were there
em	emmachamberlain	762.66	767.96	Grandparents were there uncles aunts everybody you can think of was there The crowd was going
em	emmachamberlain	767.96	775.85	Wild when we finally finished our fifth grade orchestra performance and all of us sucked We probably sounded like actual crap considering
em	emmachamberlain	775.85	777.57	we were literally fifth graders and
em	emmachamberlain	777.57	780.56	Barely had brains developed yet just kidding that's not true
em	emmachamberlain	780.56	788.19	But you know what I mean um anyway so obviously it at the end of the year they gave out awards for people who are really outstanding
em	emmachamberlain	788.19	792.96	So I was sitting there in my chair You know I wasn't expecting to get an award
em	emmachamberlain	792.96	795.2	because well I
em	emmachamberlain	795.2	802.32	just didn't play like I literally move my fingers and just like lightly put my bow the bow I'll insert a
em	emmachamberlain	802.32	806.45	Bow across like the thing I wouldn't even make any noise with my actual cello
em	emmachamberlain	806.45	810.39	I would just kind of like fake it the whole time so I wasn't really expecting
em	emmachamberlain	810.39	817.29	An award because I really didn't deserve it basically I heard our conductor guy say like all
em	emmachamberlain	817.29	821.69	Of the people who play cello stand up That's why I heard in my brain okay
em	emmachamberlain	821.69	828.38	I don't know why I've heard this because that is not what he said he said blank name stand up
em	emmachamberlain	828.38	833.54	I thought he said all the people who play cello stand up but it turned out He said like
em	emmachamberlain	833.54	839.18	This cello player stand up and it said her name and then she stood up well I stood up with her
em	emmachamberlain	839.18	846.78	But I didn't win the award tho
em	emmachamberlain	846.78	853.65	Okay moving on How many relationships have you been in haha ONE in Fifth grade
em	emmachamberlain	853.65	858.87	so but I mean I guess in you're sixteen you don't need to be in a relationship so I guess it's fine but I'm
em	emmachamberlain	858.87	861.41	No I'm just kidding I'm good Single life is the best life ya know
em	emmachamberlain	861.41	867.96	If you could give your younger self any advice what would it be You will never regret being kind
em	emmachamberlain	867.96	872.94	one thing that you know now that you wish you would have known as a kid that's like the same question and
em	emmachamberlain	872.94	877.2	I'll say it again You will never regret being kind
em	emmachamberlain	877.2	878.7	ever
em	emmachamberlain	878.7	880.17	Okay
em	emmachamberlain	880.17	885.54	Like I just remember how me and everybody was in Middle school to each other and it was just the norm you know
