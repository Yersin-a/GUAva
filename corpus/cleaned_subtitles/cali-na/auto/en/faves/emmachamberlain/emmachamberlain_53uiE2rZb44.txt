em	emmachamberlain	182.389	187.219	favorite snack I feel like I eat a bunch
em	emmachamberlain	187.219	188.359	of small snacks throughout the day like
em	emmachamberlain	188.359	189.919	I never eat like a big meal I just eat
em	emmachamberlain	189.919	191.84	snacks honestly I like to drink like my
em	emmachamberlain	191.84	193.819	favorite snack is those strawberry
em	emmachamberlain	193.819	195.5	smoothies that I drink where's just
em	emmachamberlain	195.5	198.53	strawberries lemon in water really good
em	emmachamberlain	198.53	200.319	favorite holiday I like Christmas
em	emmachamberlain	200.319	203.269	because I'm basic I mean like I don't
em	emmachamberlain	203.269	205.04	know every other holiday just seems to
em	emmachamberlain	205.04	207.5	be like not as awesome as Christmas the
em	emmachamberlain	207.5	209.51	best vibes the most like I don't know I
em	emmachamberlain	209.51	211.01	slept that time of the year Christmas
em	emmachamberlain	211.01	214.79	favorite pastime I like I mean you know
em	emmachamberlain	214.79	219.109	exercising taking that editing videos
em	emmachamberlain	219.109	222.349	filming videos taking more naps so yeah
em	emmachamberlain	222.349	224.209	my main form of pastime is like doing
em	emmachamberlain	224.209	226.459	videos right now and go to the gym
em	emmachamberlain	226.459	228.68	favorite sport probably to my favorites
em	emmachamberlain	228.68	230.209	I did competitive cheer which i think is
em	emmachamberlain	230.209	232.43	a sport some people you know don't come
em	emmachamberlain	232.43	234.29	at me but like I think cheers the sport
em	emmachamberlain	234.29	236.359	when it's competitive and so probably
em	emmachamberlain	236.359	239.9	that or track because I did track this
em	emmachamberlain	239.9	241.609	year at school and I really liked it
em	emmachamberlain	241.609	243.379	what is something you are talented at
em	emmachamberlain	243.379	244.759	personally I don't like this question
em	emmachamberlain	244.759	246.769	because like I don't know like I don't
em	emmachamberlain	246.769	248.689	really know if I'm talented at anything
em	emmachamberlain	248.689	250.909	because like you're your own worst
em	emmachamberlain	250.909	253.489	critic so like I kind of think I suck at
em	emmachamberlain	253.489	255.109	everything but like that's kind of human
em	emmachamberlain	255.109	257.03	nature so I don't know when I'm talented
em	emmachamberlain	257.03	258.32	at honestly I don't have an answer for
em	emmachamberlain	258.32	259.94	that what is something you wish you were
em	emmachamberlain	259.94	261.409	talented at I mean I wish I was talented
em	emmachamberlain	261.409	263.26	everything I wish I was a good saying
em	emmachamberlain	263.26	265.81	I wish I was like a good dancer I wish
em	emmachamberlain	265.81	267.79	that I was I don't know I wish I was
em	emmachamberlain	267.79	268.9	good at a lot of things I wish I was
em	emmachamberlain	268.9	271.03	like a really fast runner I don't know I
em	emmachamberlain	271.03	273.25	wish I was talented that everything
em	emmachamberlain	273.25	275.8	honestly are you competitive II it like
em	emmachamberlain	275.8	277.78	depends like I can be super competitive
em	emmachamberlain	277.78	279.4	in certain situations where I just like
em	emmachamberlain	279.4	281.71	need to win but then other times I'm
em	emmachamberlain	281.71	283.45	like it I don't really mind moving so
em	emmachamberlain	283.45	284.23	it's like it's kind of in between
em	emmachamberlain	284.23	286.48	describe yourself in a single sentence
em	emmachamberlain	286.48	288.13	oh my god this is getting really hard um
em	emmachamberlain	288.13	289.9	I don't I don't know how to like put it
em	emmachamberlain	289.9	291.46	new Sens I think I'm like pretty hard
em	emmachamberlain	291.46	293.35	working and like you know like if I get
em	emmachamberlain	293.35	295.51	my head okay just mechanism it if I like
em	emmachamberlain	295.51	297.82	get set on something like I will not
em	emmachamberlain	297.82	300.12	stop till I like get that thing and
em	emmachamberlain	300.12	303.58	that's a sense about me what is the best
em	emmachamberlain	303.58	305.02	compliment you ever received
em	emmachamberlain	305.02	306.61	I think whatever people say like I'm a
em	emmachamberlain	306.61	308.14	really like nice person or my kind
em	emmachamberlain	308.14	309.79	person or people say that to me that's
em	emmachamberlain	309.79	311.89	like probably the nicest compliment I
em	emmachamberlain	311.89	313.21	could get because it's something I like
em	emmachamberlain	313.21	315.58	strive to do is like be a kind person
em	emmachamberlain	315.58	317.86	and be nice or whatever so when people
em	emmachamberlain	317.86	320.77	say that I succeed at that it really
em	emmachamberlain	320.77	323.17	makes me super happy so probably that
em	emmachamberlain	323.17	325.09	what are some of your bad habits
em	emmachamberlain	325.09	326.8	probably like overthinking a lot I
em	emmachamberlain	326.8	328.63	definitely think about things like way
em	emmachamberlain	328.63	330.49	too much I overanalyze every single
em	emmachamberlain	330.49	331.3	situation ever
em	emmachamberlain	331.3	333.88	that's probably probably um favourite
em	emmachamberlain	333.88	335.77	things about yourself I would say is
em	emmachamberlain	335.77	337.09	like what I said earlier how I like
em	emmachamberlain	337.09	339.1	don't stop until I like succeed at
em	emmachamberlain	339.1	340.44	whatever I wanted to see that and
em	emmachamberlain	340.44	343.0	obviously sometimes I don't succeed but
em	emmachamberlain	343.0	345.79	if I like reach the end or like I push
em	emmachamberlain	345.79	348.13	myself to like the highest point that
em	emmachamberlain	348.13	349.75	was like successful point I can get to
em	emmachamberlain	349.75	352.15	probably that what is on the top of your
em	emmachamberlain	352.15	354.25	bucket list honestly I don't really have
em	emmachamberlain	354.25	355.78	like specific things on my bucket list
em	emmachamberlain	355.78	359.23	but I know for sure I want to I
em	emmachamberlain	359.23	360.82	definitely want to travel more I mean
em	emmachamberlain	360.82	362.23	that's like a really like cliche answer
em	emmachamberlain	362.23	364.06	but like go outside of the country or
em	emmachamberlain	364.06	367.21	maybe go to like I don't know Bali looks
em	emmachamberlain	367.21	369.25	really cool kind of wanna go there like
em	emmachamberlain	369.25	371.23	just like really like unique places just
em	emmachamberlain	371.23	373.24	like explore more you know three
em	emmachamberlain	373.24	375.76	long-term goals honestly I would just
em	emmachamberlain	375.76	377.41	say like overall I'm not even going to
em	emmachamberlain	377.41	378.91	say three because I only have one just
em	emmachamberlain	378.91	381.28	like wherever I'm at in my life at any
em	emmachamberlain	381.28	384.82	point be like really happy and like just
em	emmachamberlain	384.82	386.35	genuinely happy whether that means like
em	emmachamberlain	386.35	389.44	whatever that means in the other aspects
em	emmachamberlain	389.44	390.88	of my life like I don't care about that
em	emmachamberlain	390.88	393.52	I don't care what I end up doing is that
em	emmachamberlain	393.52	395.559	except just overall being happy and
em	emmachamberlain	395.559	398.589	also really cliche but like the truth
em	emmachamberlain	398.589	400.479	three short-term global we're not that
em	emmachamberlain	400.479	401.829	short-term that would probably mean
em	emmachamberlain	401.829	403.899	today and that would mean try to not
em	emmachamberlain	403.899	405.729	take it off and then try to not drink
em	emmachamberlain	405.729	408.479	more than three coffees within one hour
em	emmachamberlain	408.479	410.679	it's hard and I don't know if I'm gonna
em	emmachamberlain	410.679	412.689	succeed but I think that I might be able
em	emmachamberlain	412.689	414.999	to so I'll let you know what are you
em	emmachamberlain	414.999	416.409	doing today to accomplish those goals
em	emmachamberlain	416.409	418.869	well I haven't done anything for either
em	emmachamberlain	418.869	421.509	of those today taking a nap wise it is
em	emmachamberlain	421.509	424.029	currently twelve pm and I have not taken a
em	emmachamberlain	424.029	425.799	nap yet so we are going strong in that
em	emmachamberlain	425.799	427.719	aspect the coffee thing I already had
em	emmachamberlain	427.719	431.919	two today so I'm not doing so well on
em	emmachamberlain	431.919	435.099	that one but I think I think if I really
em	emmachamberlain	435.099	436.659	control myself and I can wait another
em	emmachamberlain	436.659	440.109	like twenty minutes I might be able to only
em	emmachamberlain	440.109	442.089	have one more coffee today so we'll see
em	emmachamberlain	442.089	443.399	what is your biggest accomplishment
em	emmachamberlain	443.399	445.599	becoming more confident and happy and
em	emmachamberlain	445.599	446.589	summing that sexuality a big
em	emmachamberlain	446.589	448.059	accomplishment although starting a
em	emmachamberlain	448.059	449.679	YouTube channel because I always wanted
em	emmachamberlain	449.679	452.559	to and it was kind of an interesting
em	emmachamberlain	452.559	454.569	story about how it happened so one day I
em	emmachamberlain	454.569	455.799	will do a story time and tell you why I
em	emmachamberlain	455.799	456.999	started YouTube because it's actually
em	emmachamberlain	456.999	458.889	really interesting but I had a channel a
em	emmachamberlain	458.889	461.649	long time ago like in like fourth grade
em	emmachamberlain	461.649	463.689	and I did like outfits on there and it
em	emmachamberlain	463.689	465.819	was like horrible and I can't find those
em	emmachamberlain	465.819	468.069	videos anymore luckily like literally
em	emmachamberlain	468.069	469.719	thank God they were so embarrassing but
em	emmachamberlain	469.719	471.279	I'm probably also like starting a
em	emmachamberlain	471.279	472.899	YouTube again because I always wanted to
em	emmachamberlain	472.899	475.149	and now I'm doing it so that's cool
em	emmachamberlain	475.149	477.309	what didn't I feel first date for you
em	emmachamberlain	477.309	480.899	okay well I don't go on dates very often
em	emmachamberlain	480.899	484.359	sadly this is also kind of cliche I
em	emmachamberlain	484.359	485.499	don't like things like going to the
em	emmachamberlain	485.499	487.229	movies I don't like things like a dinner
em	emmachamberlain	487.229	489.519	because I just like really boring to me
em	emmachamberlain	489.519	491.409	like just so like awkward well with a
em	emmachamberlain	491.409	492.729	movie it's just awkward because you
em	emmachamberlain	492.729	494.529	can't talk and it's just weird and then
em	emmachamberlain	494.529	496.209	do you like went to dinner you're like
em	emmachamberlain	496.209	498.009	force like look at the other person in
em	emmachamberlain	498.009	499.329	the face and then they have to watch you
em	emmachamberlain	499.329	500.859	eat I don't know do something about
em	emmachamberlain	500.859	502.569	that's just too boring um something like
em	emmachamberlain	502.569	505.019	really fun like in adventure like
em	emmachamberlain	505.019	507.399	driving somewhere kind of far away like
em	emmachamberlain	507.399	508.809	driving to the beach or something like
em	emmachamberlain	508.809	510.999	swimming in the ocean at like 200 am
em	emmachamberlain	510.999	512.559	or something okay that's actually good
em	emmachamberlain	512.559	514.389	not really fun something like that it
em	emmachamberlain	514.389	515.949	would be like really memorable and like
em	emmachamberlain	515.949	518.649	special so what is something you look
em	emmachamberlain	518.649	521.709	for in a partner I'm sixteen and I have
em	emmachamberlain	521.709	524.229	basically no experience in this topic
em	emmachamberlain	524.229	526.569	but I would say just like somebody who
em	emmachamberlain	526.569	528.71	is like willing to put in
em	emmachamberlain	528.71	530.57	people effort into the relationship but
em	emmachamberlain	530.57	532.49	also like somebody who you can trust in
em	emmachamberlain	532.49	533.93	like the trust is mutual so like you're
em	emmachamberlain	533.93	535.49	not worried about like where they are
em	emmachamberlain	535.49	536.96	all the time or who they're talking to
em	emmachamberlain	536.96	539.48	or whatever like somebody like trust me
em	emmachamberlain	539.48	540.86	enough that like I could like hang out
em	emmachamberlain	540.86	542.6	with another guy friend and like the guy
em	emmachamberlain	542.6	543.89	wouldn't care you know also just
em	emmachamberlain	543.89	545.81	somebody who's like genuinely kind and
em	emmachamberlain	545.81	547.64	like thoughtful of me and my feelings
em	emmachamberlain	547.64	550.76	because I'm like emo I'm kidding um but
em	emmachamberlain	550.76	552.23	like yes so he's like really like
em	emmachamberlain	552.23	553.91	considers your feelings I'm bad at this
em	emmachamberlain	553.91	556.01	stuff who is your role model I would say
em	emmachamberlain	556.01	558.47	like definitely my parents I mean for
em	emmachamberlain	558.47	559.97	sure like that's an obvious one I was
em	emmachamberlain	559.97	560.99	something like a really inspirational
em	emmachamberlain	560.99	563.24	person is like Casey nice - a youtuber
em	emmachamberlain	563.24	564.59	he's a great person I don't know he's
em	emmachamberlain	564.59	566.0	really inspirational to me which one of
em	emmachamberlain	566.0	568.07	your parents are you more like depends
em	emmachamberlain	568.07	569.87	like really similar to my dad because we
em	emmachamberlain	569.87	571.49	like the same music we like doing the
em	emmachamberlain	571.49	573.08	same things he has a YouTube channel too
em	emmachamberlain	573.08	575.63	we both like to like go like explore in
em	emmachamberlain	575.63	577.37	the city and like you know I get coffee
em	emmachamberlain	577.37	579.11	and stuff except I think we have a lot
em	emmachamberlain	579.11	580.55	of like I also think I'm aligned with my
em	emmachamberlain	580.55	582.68	mom because you know we both like enjoy
em	emmachamberlain	582.68	585.32	it sort of women parts of like life like
em	emmachamberlain	585.32	587.51	shopping and like stuff like that so it
em	emmachamberlain	587.51	588.95	kind of depends which one of your
em	emmachamberlain	588.95	590.78	parents are you closest to this is also
em	emmachamberlain	590.78	592.85	kind of like I don't have one or the
em	emmachamberlain	592.85	594.92	other I'm close with both equally in
em	emmachamberlain	594.92	596.84	like different ways because I'm an only
em	emmachamberlain	596.84	597.32	child
em	emmachamberlain	597.32	598.64	only children get really close with
em	emmachamberlain	598.64	601.01	their parents so both honestly what is
em	emmachamberlain	601.01	603.47	the last book you read um I don't read
em	emmachamberlain	603.47	605.54	like I genuinely do not read ever
em	emmachamberlain	605.54	607.61	because I hate it I don't know why I
em	emmachamberlain	607.61	609.41	just don't like reading and let them
em	emmachamberlain	609.41	611.0	find like a really really good book that
em	emmachamberlain	611.0	613.79	I like really love I just don't read so
em	emmachamberlain	613.79	616.16	I don't have an answer for that what is
em	emmachamberlain	616.16	619.16	your favorite fairy tale I help freaking
em	emmachamberlain	619.16	621.29	know like I ever like what what even is
em	emmachamberlain	621.29	622.7	a fairy tale like I mean I know but like
em	emmachamberlain	622.7	624.26	I know I don't have an answer what is
em	emmachamberlain	624.26	626.36	your favorite quote I hate reading
em	emmachamberlain	626.36	628.46	quotes out loud like something about
em	emmachamberlain	628.46	630.53	that is so corny to me but let me look
em	emmachamberlain	630.53	632.45	at my Pinterest on my quote board and
em	emmachamberlain	632.45	633.98	I'll just read one that I find how the
em	emmachamberlain	633.98	635.65	keep it simple good things are coming
em	emmachamberlain	635.65	637.25	that's a good one
em	emmachamberlain	637.25	639.02	remember that kids keep doing that good
em	emmachamberlain	639.02	640.67	mindset you know favorite subject in
em	emmachamberlain	640.67	642.89	school probably science it's the most
em	emmachamberlain	642.89	646.04	interesting to me it's also one of the
em	emmachamberlain	646.04	648.05	hardest classes in school for me but I
em	emmachamberlain	648.05	650.6	do enjoy science so probably that I like
em	emmachamberlain	650.6	653.51	biology more than chemistry definitely
em	emmachamberlain	653.51	655.88	subject you were best at honestly like
em	emmachamberlain	655.88	657.26	depends because like I don't think I'm
em	emmachamberlain	657.26	658.73	very like it depends on like if you mean
em	emmachamberlain	658.73	660.86	like which I personally think I strive
em	emmachamberlain	660.86	661.52	at or like
em	emmachamberlain	661.52	663.98	which one has a better grade like that's
em	emmachamberlain	663.98	666.92	just different but like I think I'm okay
em	emmachamberlain	666.92	668.9	like history and stuff like that but I
em	emmachamberlain	668.9	671.15	absolutely hate it so it's like I
em	emmachamberlain	671.15	672.8	vennett like I'm probably better at
em	emmachamberlain	672.8	674.63	history in English so I am it like math
em	emmachamberlain	674.63	676.22	and science but like I enjoy math and
em	emmachamberlain	676.22	678.56	science more don't ask me why
em	emmachamberlain	678.56	681.5	favorite teacher honestly I don't have
em	emmachamberlain	681.5	683.99	an answer I liked all of my teachers in
em	emmachamberlain	683.99	685.49	elementary school in the second I got to
em	emmachamberlain	685.49	690.68	high school the relationships weren't as
em	emmachamberlain	690.68	692.21	good in high school and I'm still in
em	emmachamberlain	692.21	694.91	high school yeah it's just a lot more on
em	emmachamberlain	694.91	697.91	the line a lot more tension so that's
em	emmachamberlain	697.91	699.92	that we look the biggest impact on your
em	emmachamberlain	699.92	703.76	life probably my parents because they've
em	emmachamberlain	703.76	704.81	always been there my whole entire life
em	emmachamberlain	704.81	706.61	so there's really nobody else in this
em	emmachamberlain	706.61	708.44	entire universe who could have more of
em	emmachamberlain	708.44	710.0	an impact on me than my parents because
em	emmachamberlain	710.0	711.47	I've been around them my whole life
em	emmachamberlain	711.47	712.94	and I'm an only child and they're like
em	emmachamberlain	712.94	715.16	the biggest influence on me what do you
em	emmachamberlain	715.16	717.71	use most probably Instagram or visco
em	emmachamberlain	717.71	719.39	what these are technology could you not
em	emmachamberlain	719.39	719.81	live without
em	emmachamberlain	719.81	721.58	honestly I don't just have one phone
em	emmachamberlain	721.58	724.91	laptop very important and camera also
em	emmachamberlain	724.91	727.31	very important but if for some reason I
em	emmachamberlain	727.31	729.17	couldn't have a camera the phone as the
em	emmachamberlain	729.17	730.88	camera so probably phoned in laptop what
em	emmachamberlain	730.88	732.68	countries have you visited well I've
em	emmachamberlain	732.68	734.72	been out of the country twice I went to
em	emmachamberlain	734.72	736.4	Ireland and then I went to the Dominican
em	emmachamberlain	736.4	737.81	Republic what countries would you like
em	emmachamberlain	737.81	739.58	to visit if it was up to me I would
em	emmachamberlain	739.58	741.11	visit every country in the entire
em	emmachamberlain	741.11	741.98	universe
em	emmachamberlain	741.98	745.4	so most embarrassing memory oh my god
em	emmachamberlain	745.4	746.99	okay this is really good so basically
em	emmachamberlain	746.99	750.11	like I did cello in fifth grade um which
em	emmachamberlain	750.11	752.03	is weird considering I literally four
em	emmachamberlain	752.03	754.4	foot six inches and probably weighed 50
em	emmachamberlain	754.4	756.44	pounds and was basically the size of a
em	emmachamberlain	756.44	758.87	cello but anyway it was the end of the
em	emmachamberlain	758.87	760.37	school year and we had like our last
em	emmachamberlain	760.37	762.32	recital saying parents were their
em	emmachamberlain	762.32	764.06	grandparents were their uncles off
em	emmachamberlain	764.06	766.04	everybody you can think of was there the
em	emmachamberlain	766.04	769.4	crowd was going wild when we finally
em	emmachamberlain	769.4	771.38	finished our fifth grade Orchestra
em	emmachamberlain	771.38	773.69	performance and all of us sucks we
em	emmachamberlain	773.69	775.31	probably sounded like actual crafts
em	emmachamberlain	775.31	776.69	considering we were literally just dry
em	emmachamberlain	776.69	779.27	turned and barely had brains developed
em	emmachamberlain	779.27	781.13	yet just kidding that's not true but you
em	emmachamberlain	781.13	783.8	don't mean um anyway so obviously it at
em	emmachamberlain	783.8	786.14	the end of the year they gave out awards
em	emmachamberlain	786.14	788.69	for people who are really outstanding so
em	emmachamberlain	788.69	790.64	I was sitting there in my chair you know
em	emmachamberlain	790.64	792.46	I wasn't expecting to get an award
em	emmachamberlain	792.46	795.2	because well I
em	emmachamberlain	795.2	796.94	just didn't play like I literally move
em	emmachamberlain	796.94	799.22	my fingers and just like lightly put my
em	emmachamberlain	799.22	803.21	bow the bow I'll insert a bow across
em	emmachamberlain	803.21	805.16	like the thing I wouldn't even make any
em	emmachamberlain	805.16	806.9	noise with my actual cello I would just
em	emmachamberlain	806.9	808.4	kind of like fake it the whole time
em	emmachamberlain	808.4	811.31	so I wasn't really expecting an award
em	emmachamberlain	811.31	813.02	because I really didn't deserve it
em	emmachamberlain	813.02	816.38	basically I heard our conductor guy say
em	emmachamberlain	816.38	818.87	like all of the people who play cello
em	emmachamberlain	818.87	821.27	stand up that's why I heard in my brain
em	emmachamberlain	821.27	823.28	okay I don't know why I've heard this
em	emmachamberlain	823.28	825.86	because that is not what he said he said
em	emmachamberlain	825.86	829.49	blank name stand up I thought he said
em	emmachamberlain	829.49	831.68	all the people who play cello stand up
em	emmachamberlain	831.68	834.05	but it turned out he said like this
em	emmachamberlain	834.05	836.3	cello player stand up and it said her
em	emmachamberlain	836.3	838.13	name and then she stood up well I'd sit
em	emmachamberlain	838.13	839.87	up with her but I didn't win me Awards
em	emmachamberlain	839.87	848.54	oh okay moving on how many relationships
em	emmachamberlain	848.54	853.15	have you been in haha one in fifth grade
em	emmachamberlain	853.15	855.59	so but I mean I guess in you're sixteen you
em	emmachamberlain	855.59	856.82	don't need to be in a relationship so I
em	emmachamberlain	856.82	859.49	guess it's fine but I'm no I'm just
em	emmachamberlain	859.49	861.17	getting good I'm good single life is the
em	emmachamberlain	861.17	862.58	best life you know if you could give
em	emmachamberlain	862.58	863.96	your younger self any advice what would
em	emmachamberlain	863.96	864.32	it be
em	emmachamberlain	864.32	868.46	you will never regret being kind one
em	emmachamberlain	868.46	869.99	thing that you know now that you wish
em	emmachamberlain	869.99	871.46	you would have known as a kid that's
em	emmachamberlain	871.46	873.8	like the same question and I'll say it
em	emmachamberlain	873.8	876.7	again you will never regret being kind
em	emmachamberlain	876.7	882.35	ever okay like I just remember how me
em	emmachamberlain	882.35	883.85	and everybody was in middle school to
em	emmachamberlain	883.85	885.35	each other and it was just the norm you
em	emmachamberlain	885.35	887.54	know second grade self girl would steal
em	emmachamberlain	887.54	890.09	your sticker and talk about a freaking
em	emmachamberlain	890.09	892.28	fight and like at this point in my life
em	emmachamberlain	892.28	894.2	I've learned you know just be the bigger
em	emmachamberlain	894.2	896.27	person always be kind no matter what
em	emmachamberlain	896.27	898.22	anybody says it up to you being kind you
em	emmachamberlain	898.22	898.97	will never regret it
em	emmachamberlain	898.97	902.35	okay tea or coffee okay coffee I'm sorry
em	emmachamberlain	902.35	905.12	that's just like not even a question I
em	emmachamberlain	905.12	907.46	don't even like that we don't even need
em	emmachamberlain	907.46	911.15	to discuss it okay coffee how tall are
em	emmachamberlain	911.15	913.4	you I am five three and a half but I
em	emmachamberlain	913.4	916.13	think I'm 5'4 now so I don't know cats
em	emmachamberlain	916.13	919.82	or dogs um dogs I mean I don't know I
em	emmachamberlain	919.82	921.74	just like dogs better sorry I'll do cat
em	emmachamberlain	921.74	924.38	people know hey I have cats and dogs so
em	emmachamberlain	924.38	926.78	like yeah but dog alert is better don't
em	emmachamberlain	926.78	928.88	everybody who doesn't like dogs doesn't
em	emmachamberlain	928.88	931.94	on one so like that's the answer to that
em	emmachamberlain	931.94	934.16	funniest moment throughout school on
em	emmachamberlain	934.16	935.81	stage like all moments in school are
em	emmachamberlain	935.81	939.26	absolute hell rather than anything funny
em	emmachamberlain	939.26	941.78	I usually am NOT laughing during 12
em	emmachamberlain	941.78	944.96	usually crying hysterically constantly
em	emmachamberlain	944.96	947.15	because of how much I actually despise
em	emmachamberlain	947.15	949.43	being there if I think of one later I'll
em	emmachamberlain	949.43	950.78	let you know but like for right now all
em	emmachamberlain	950.78	953.75	my memories are just absolute terror are
em	emmachamberlain	953.75	956.15	you in slash have you gone to college I
em	emmachamberlain	956.15	958.55	am going to be a junior next year stone
em	emmachamberlain	958.55	960.77	no what was your worst subject in high
em	emmachamberlain	960.77	962.21	school um while I'm in high school now
em	emmachamberlain	962.21	964.31	and worse subject honestly I think my
em	emmachamberlain	964.31	966.65	least favorite would have to be English
em	emmachamberlain	966.65	969.74	I just think it's so boring but I think
em	emmachamberlain	969.74	971.36	the one that I was like the worst outlet
em	emmachamberlain	971.36	972.89	had the worst grade was probably like
em	emmachamberlain	972.89	974.36	chemistry but like I actually really
em	emmachamberlain	974.36	975.8	liked chemistry so it's kind of like a
em	emmachamberlain	975.8	978.26	love-hate favorite animal okay I really
em	emmachamberlain	978.26	981.17	I really like all animals I think it's
em	emmachamberlain	981.17	982.58	easier to say the ones that I don't like
em	emmachamberlain	982.58	985.64	I have a actual phobia like no joke
em	emmachamberlain	985.64	988.31	dead-ass phobia of caterpillars I hate
em	emmachamberlain	988.31	990.14	them but I don't even like I don't care
em	emmachamberlain	990.14	992.63	about snakes I spiders or if you like if
em	emmachamberlain	992.63	994.37	they're near me I freaked out but is
em	emmachamberlain	994.37	995.54	there like ten feet away from me I don't
em	emmachamberlain	995.54	995.9	care
em	emmachamberlain	995.9	999.26	um like I'm cool doll that caterpillars
em	emmachamberlain	999.26	1004.0	just really make me lose it like I just
em	emmachamberlain	1004.0	1006.16	I can't if they're near me if I see a
em	emmachamberlain	1006.16	1008.95	picture of one like I will initiate I
em	emmachamberlain	1008.95	1010.51	don't know I don't know it's mental what
em	emmachamberlain	1010.51	1012.22	sports do you play so have you played
em	emmachamberlain	1012.22	1013.51	well earlier I mentioned that I did
em	emmachamberlain	1013.51	1016.75	cheer and track but I also did okay this
em	emmachamberlain	1016.75	1019.59	is going to take a while I did karate
em	emmachamberlain	1019.59	1022.3	Taekwondo when I was like six so that
em	emmachamberlain	1022.3	1024.01	happened so I did ice skating I did
em	emmachamberlain	1024.01	1028.449	gymnastics I did I never did any like
em	emmachamberlain	1028.449	1030.13	ball sports I can ever do softball or
em	emmachamberlain	1030.13	1032.14	soccer I never did any of that and then
em	emmachamberlain	1032.14	1034.63	I did cheerleading competitively then I
em	emmachamberlain	1034.63	1035.949	also did in high school two year for
em	emmachamberlain	1035.949	1038.47	like a half of a year and then I did
em	emmachamberlain	1038.47	1041.079	cross-country for one year and then I
em	emmachamberlain	1041.079	1043.03	did track for one year and I did both of
em	emmachamberlain	1043.03	1044.89	those track and cross-country slash your

em	emmachamberlain	1066.98	1068.48	no joke if I read them today I would
em	emmachamberlain	1068.48	1070.97	still enjoy them because they were so
em	emmachamberlain	1070.97	1073.34	good like I don't know why they're like
em	emmachamberlain	1073.34	1076.94	teen books but they're so good like I I
em	emmachamberlain	1076.94	1078.08	need to read them again because I

em	emmachamberlain	1079.28	1081.14	grade but they were like my favorite

em	emmachamberlain	1320.41	1322.0	amount of questions and stuff and
em	emmachamberlain	1322.0	1323.35	there's like repeats because I combined
