Th	TheRealBlasiann	130.16	133.84	let's get into this video right now
Th	TheRealBlasiann	133.84	136.4	so the first question is how old are you

Th	TheRealBlasiann	142.8	145.92	1998 and i am a
Th	TheRealBlasiann	145.92	148.8	virgo no cocky [ __ ] i feel like burgers
Th	TheRealBlasiann	148.8	150.0	is the best sign
Th	TheRealBlasiann	150.0	152.16	like if i wasn't even a virgo i would
Th	TheRealBlasiann	152.16	153.84	still say virgos is the best sign
Th	TheRealBlasiann	153.84	156.56	because what like beyonce's a virgo
Th	TheRealBlasiann	156.56	157.519	queen of b
Th	TheRealBlasiann	157.519	160.8	is a virgo
Th	TheRealBlasiann	160.8	165.04	okay question number two
Th	TheRealBlasiann	165.04	166.8	are you still in school and what school
Th	TheRealBlasiann	166.8	169.44	do you go to i am currently enrolled as
Th	TheRealBlasiann	169.44	171.599	a senior at ucla this is my
Th	TheRealBlasiann	171.599	175.12	last year thank god
Th	TheRealBlasiann	175.12	179.44	um yeah so i'm still in school i'm doing
Th	TheRealBlasiann	179.44	181.28	it online because of rona
Th	TheRealBlasiann	181.28	184.48	but i just want to walk the stage
Th	TheRealBlasiann	184.48	186.0	honestly i don't care where i'm doing
Th	TheRealBlasiann	186.0	187.36	school from just as long as i get to
Th	TheRealBlasiann	187.36	189.519	walk that stage in june
Th	TheRealBlasiann	189.519	192.0	and do my little this little cross
Th	TheRealBlasiann	192.0	193.68	stitch i'm good
Th	TheRealBlasiann	193.68	195.12	question number three any advice for
Th	TheRealBlasiann	195.12	197.28	high schoolers or college advice
Th	TheRealBlasiann	197.28	199.44	um let me think back to when i was in
Th	TheRealBlasiann	199.44	200.959	high school because that
Th	TheRealBlasiann	200.959	203.04	was a really long time ago i graduated
Th	TheRealBlasiann	203.04	204.879	in 2016
Th	TheRealBlasiann	204.879	207.84	but i personally did not take high
Th	TheRealBlasiann	207.84	210.879	school serious at all
Th	TheRealBlasiann	210.879	213.599	um freshman year i had straight a's i
Th	TheRealBlasiann	213.599	214.319	was like
Th	TheRealBlasiann	214.319	216.319	real good kids sophomore and junior
Th	TheRealBlasiann	216.319	218.4	definitely worked hard and they kept
Th	TheRealBlasiann	218.4	222.64	my butt senior year i picked up
Th	TheRealBlasiann	222.64	224.879	the slack and my grades was good just
Th	TheRealBlasiann	224.879	226.159	like freshman year
Th	TheRealBlasiann	226.159	228.56	but i feel like colleges really look at
Th	TheRealBlasiann	228.56	229.28	your
Th	TheRealBlasiann	229.28	231.2	sophomore and junior year grades not so
Th	TheRealBlasiann	231.2	233.519	much your freshman or your senior year
Th	TheRealBlasiann	233.519	236.56	um and that's where like i got that
Th	TheRealBlasiann	236.56	238.56	and so with the grades that i had in my
Th	TheRealBlasiann	238.56	240.64	overall gpa i just knew i wasn't going
Th	TheRealBlasiann	240.64	242.64	to be able to go to like berkeley or
Th	TheRealBlasiann	242.64	244.64	ucla
Th	TheRealBlasiann	244.64	247.2	all the top schools that i would hope to
Th	TheRealBlasiann	247.2	248.56	have went to
Th	TheRealBlasiann	248.56	251.04	so i chose the route of going to a
Th	TheRealBlasiann	251.04	252.64	junior college for two years
Th	TheRealBlasiann	252.64	255.599	i went to de anza community college i
Th	TheRealBlasiann	255.599	257.759	play basketball for them too
Th	TheRealBlasiann	257.759	259.359	but i went to danza community college
Th	TheRealBlasiann	259.359	261.519	for two years and then i reapplied to
Th	TheRealBlasiann	261.519	263.199	colleges
Th	TheRealBlasiann	263.199	264.88	after the two years and i ended up
Th	TheRealBlasiann	264.88	266.4	getting into ucla
Th	TheRealBlasiann	266.4	268.4	high school advice i would definitely
Th	TheRealBlasiann	268.4	269.44	say
Th	TheRealBlasiann	269.44	272.479	take your grades seriously like
Th	TheRealBlasiann	272.479	275.199	if you don't want to go to a jc for two
Th	TheRealBlasiann	275.199	276.56	years and you want to go straight
Th	TheRealBlasiann	276.56	278.639	out of high school take high school
Th	TheRealBlasiann	278.639	279.6	seriously
Th	TheRealBlasiann	279.6	283.44	but also make time for your social life
Th	TheRealBlasiann	283.44	285.199	so you have to find a balance between
Th	TheRealBlasiann	285.199	287.28	your social life and your school life
Th	TheRealBlasiann	287.28	290.16	um me i was more of just like social
Th	TheRealBlasiann	290.16	290.639	life so
Th	TheRealBlasiann	290.639	293.12	i was an athlete i was just you know
Th	TheRealBlasiann	293.12	294.0	wanted to
Th	TheRealBlasiann	294.0	297.919	play ball and all that
Th	TheRealBlasiann	297.919	299.84	but i went to an all asian school so it
Th	TheRealBlasiann	299.84	301.84	was a lot of pressure on the students
Th	TheRealBlasiann	301.84	303.52	that went there because
Th	TheRealBlasiann	303.52	305.919	not stereotyping not trying to be racist
Th	TheRealBlasiann	305.919	307.199	or nothing but
Th	TheRealBlasiann	307.199	310.4	asians are known to take schooling more
Th	TheRealBlasiann	310.4	313.44	serious you know so i would definitely
Th	TheRealBlasiann	313.44	314.479	say
Th	TheRealBlasiann	314.479	317.52	do work hard but
Th	TheRealBlasiann	317.52	320.639	find a balance again between schoolwork
Th	TheRealBlasiann	320.639	322.16	and your social life because you have to
Th	TheRealBlasiann	322.16	324.4	have both there you can't just have a
Th	TheRealBlasiann	324.4	326.0	school life and no social life whereas
Th	TheRealBlasiann	326.0	328.24	you're gonna go crazy advice for
Th	TheRealBlasiann	328.24	332.32	college college my first two years
Th	TheRealBlasiann	332.32	334.88	of community college was so fun because
Th	TheRealBlasiann	334.88	336.56	i don't know when i went to college
Th	TheRealBlasiann	336.56	338.72	i was expecting it to be a heavy
Th	TheRealBlasiann	338.72	340.639	workload i'm gonna be stressed out it's
Th	TheRealBlasiann	340.639	342.56	gonna be so many classes so much
Th	TheRealBlasiann	342.56	344.08	going on because i was playing
Th	TheRealBlasiann	344.08	345.36	basketball too so i was like there's no
Th	TheRealBlasiann	345.36	346.8	way i'm gonna be able to juggle this
Th	TheRealBlasiann	346.8	348.72	but i did really well my first two years
Th	TheRealBlasiann	348.72	350.88	of college while i was still playing
Th	TheRealBlasiann	350.88	354.08	ball um i made so many new friends like
Th	TheRealBlasiann	354.08	356.16	all the athletes were in the same class
Th	TheRealBlasiann	356.16	357.6	so y'all can imagine just a whole
Th	TheRealBlasiann	357.6	358.479	classroom full of
Th	TheRealBlasiann	358.479	360.16	football players basketball players
Th	TheRealBlasiann	360.16	361.759	baseball players soccer players like
Th	TheRealBlasiann	361.759	364.88	it was lit okay
Th	TheRealBlasiann	364.88	366.479	but that was good because you're
Th	TheRealBlasiann	366.479	368.4	surrounded by people who
Th	TheRealBlasiann	368.4	369.919	know what you're going through what
Th	TheRealBlasiann	369.919	372.16	you're experiencing having a juggle
Th	TheRealBlasiann	372.16	374.56	okay i got a game this day but i got a
Th	TheRealBlasiann	374.56	376.72	midterm and final this day too like you
Th	TheRealBlasiann	376.72	377.12	know
Th	TheRealBlasiann	377.12	380.319	we were all like in cahoots with
Th	TheRealBlasiann	380.319	382.24	each other like supporting each other
Th	TheRealBlasiann	382.24	383.36	through the whole
Th	TheRealBlasiann	383.36	386.72	class and that was really good
Th	TheRealBlasiann	386.72	389.039	advice for college so when i got to ucla
Th	TheRealBlasiann	389.039	390.639	i really didn't
Th	TheRealBlasiann	390.639	394.4	make friends like i was making at a jc
Th	TheRealBlasiann	394.4	394.88	like
Th	TheRealBlasiann	394.88	396.56	it was a whole different ballgame for me
Th	TheRealBlasiann	396.56	397.919	a new environment i'm
Th	TheRealBlasiann	397.919	401.12	originally from the bay area so i moved
Th	TheRealBlasiann	401.12	402.72	down to southern california
Th	TheRealBlasiann	402.72	405.759	la to go to school and i knew nobody
Th	TheRealBlasiann	405.759	407.919	there i knew one girl that's from
Th	TheRealBlasiann	407.919	410.639	vallejo california which is like
Th	TheRealBlasiann	410.639	414.08	30 minutes from me um and she was going
Th	TheRealBlasiann	414.08	416.319	to you see she got into ucla as well
Th	TheRealBlasiann	416.319	417.68	and that was like the only person i was
Th	TheRealBlasiann	417.68	419.199	kind of hanging out with we had so many
Th	TheRealBlasiann	419.199	420.16	classes together
Th	TheRealBlasiann	420.16	423.759	like that destiny if you ever watch
Th	TheRealBlasiann	423.759	426.0	this shout out to you because girl you
Th	TheRealBlasiann	426.0	428.0	helped me a lot
Th	TheRealBlasiann	428.0	429.68	but that was the only person that i
Th	TheRealBlasiann	429.68	431.759	really know uh when we would go to
Th	TheRealBlasiann	431.759	433.759	parties i'd just go with destiny and her
Th	TheRealBlasiann	433.759	435.199	friends like i never
Th	TheRealBlasiann	435.199	437.199	made friends outside of destiny except
Th	TheRealBlasiann	437.199	439.919	for one and her name was cheyenne
Th	TheRealBlasiann	439.919	442.319	cheyenne if you ever watch this i miss
Th	TheRealBlasiann	442.319	443.44	you and i love you
Th	TheRealBlasiann	443.44	447.039	we fell off on some like weak [ __ ]
Th	TheRealBlasiann	447.039	451.039	but girl come
Th	TheRealBlasiann	451.039	453.599	and those two people really helped me my
Th	TheRealBlasiann	453.599	455.52	daily routine considered me like going
Th	TheRealBlasiann	455.52	458.639	to class coming back to my dorm
Th	TheRealBlasiann	458.639	461.919	studying i would step out
Th	TheRealBlasiann	461.919	464.479	every now and then to like do laundry or
Th	TheRealBlasiann	464.479	466.479	go grab something from the cafe but most
Th	TheRealBlasiann	466.479	468.0	of the time like
Th	TheRealBlasiann	468.0	470.56	i was door dashing through my jar my
Th	TheRealBlasiann	470.56	471.36	parents were
Th	TheRealBlasiann	471.36	474.96	paying thousands of dollars for like the
Th	TheRealBlasiann	474.96	475.759	food
Th	TheRealBlasiann	475.759	477.919	slash meal program and i was not
Th	TheRealBlasiann	477.919	479.039	utilizing it
Th	TheRealBlasiann	479.039	481.52	i had so many swipes left like when i
Th	TheRealBlasiann	481.52	482.479	left ucla
Th	TheRealBlasiann	482.479	484.639	and came back home because of corona i
Th	TheRealBlasiann	484.639	487.759	had so many swipes left
Th	TheRealBlasiann	487.759	490.879	it was bad oh and another tip
Th	TheRealBlasiann	490.879	493.919	or not tip but college advice
Th	TheRealBlasiann	493.919	497.199	save your money while you are in school
Th	TheRealBlasiann	497.199	498.4	that is so
Th	TheRealBlasiann	498.4	501.599	important like i wouldn't say i depended
Th	TheRealBlasiann	501.599	503.44	on my parents a lot while i was in
Th	TheRealBlasiann	503.44	505.36	school because i was still making my own
Th	TheRealBlasiann	505.36	506.319	money
Th	TheRealBlasiann	506.319	509.599	but it's really important to save save
Th	TheRealBlasiann	509.599	511.759	save that money like if you have parents
Th	TheRealBlasiann	511.759	513.68	that are going to support you and pay
Th	TheRealBlasiann	513.68	515.2	for your schooling and your books and
Th	TheRealBlasiann	515.2	518.0	all that be appreciated because i
Th	TheRealBlasiann	518.0	519.76	know a lot of people whose parents are
Th	TheRealBlasiann	519.76	521.44	more so like oh no
Th	TheRealBlasiann	521.44	523.36	like you're making money you go pay for
Th	TheRealBlasiann	523.36	525.519	your books and college books is like 200
Th	TheRealBlasiann	525.519	528.8	of 150 a book
Th	TheRealBlasiann	528.8	531.76	so save your money if you can question
Th	TheRealBlasiann	531.76	534.32	number four how did i get into ucla
Th	TheRealBlasiann	534.32	536.64	i kind of talked about this already but
Th	TheRealBlasiann	536.64	538.48	i got into ucla
Th	TheRealBlasiann	538.48	540.399	after doing two years at a community
Th	TheRealBlasiann	540.399	542.32	college in my city
Th	TheRealBlasiann	542.32	544.72	um i had really good grades i worked

Th	TheRealBlasiann	880.56	883.68	this is hard because i spend so
Th	TheRealBlasiann	883.68	887.04	much money like
Th	TheRealBlasiann	887.04	890.079	it's done but what i
Th	TheRealBlasiann	890.079	892.8	used to do is before i started getting
Th	TheRealBlasiann	892.8	893.279	that
Th	TheRealBlasiann	893.279	896.399	big bag what i used to do was when i
Th	TheRealBlasiann	896.399	897.519	would get paid
Th	TheRealBlasiann	897.519	900.88	i would put half of my check
Th	TheRealBlasiann	900.88	903.76	in my savings and then like half of my
Th	TheRealBlasiann	903.76	904.639	check it was
Th	TheRealBlasiann	904.639	907.279	to spend so it might not be half it
Th	TheRealBlasiann	907.279	907.92	might be
Th	TheRealBlasiann	907.92	909.6	majority of my check went to my savings
Th	TheRealBlasiann	909.6	911.04	and i would keep like 100 or
Th	TheRealBlasiann	911.04	912.88	hundred dollars for me to spend and i

Th	TheRealBlasiann	914.72	916.079	really spending then
Th	TheRealBlasiann	916.079	917.839	so like if you have two hundred dollars
Th	TheRealBlasiann	917.839	919.6	and say your checkings and then your
Th	TheRealBlasiann	919.6	920.959	next check you put it under two hundred
Th	TheRealBlasiann	920.959	922.88	dollars it starts stacking nothing sorry
Th	TheRealBlasiann	922.88	924.56	is so money so you got some money in
Th	TheRealBlasiann	924.56	925.519	your checkings
Th	TheRealBlasiann	925.519	927.12	but you also got some money in your
Th	TheRealBlasiann	927.12	929.92	savings you got to do it like that
Th	TheRealBlasiann	929.92	933.36	and if you can't buy something let's say
Th	TheRealBlasiann	933.36	936.079	five times over don't buy it once and
Th	TheRealBlasiann	936.079	937.6	this doesn't go for like
