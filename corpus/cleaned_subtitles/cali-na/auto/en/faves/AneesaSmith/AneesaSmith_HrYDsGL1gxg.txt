An	AneesaSmith	7.2	8.94	let's do that again I don't know how to
An	AneesaSmith	8.94	10.83	start this hey guys welcome back to my
An	AneesaSmith	10.83	11.4	channel
An	AneesaSmith	11.4	13.2	that's much better for today's video I
An	AneesaSmith	13.2	15.48	am going to be doing a question and
An	AneesaSmith	15.48	17.789	answer video I had you guys ask me
An	AneesaSmith	17.789	20.039	questions last night on my Instagram if
An	AneesaSmith	20.039	21.57	you guys don't follow me on Instagram
An	AneesaSmith	21.57	24.019	yet my Instagram name is a right here
An	AneesaSmith	24.019	26.189	but yeah I had you guys ask you some
An	AneesaSmith	26.189	28.89	questions that you want answers to on my
An	AneesaSmith	28.89	30.84	Instagram last night so this video is
An	AneesaSmith	30.84	31.949	going to be answering all of those
An	AneesaSmith	31.949	34.469	questions so without further ado first
An	AneesaSmith	34.469	36.54	question is what is my skincare routine
An	AneesaSmith	36.54	39.989	um well I don't have a skincare routine
An	AneesaSmith	39.989	41.73	I know that sounds bad this skincare
An	AneesaSmith	41.73	44.55	routine that I have had doesn't consist
An	AneesaSmith	44.55	48.0	of a whole lot I use a just like a mild
An	AneesaSmith	48.0	49.829	cleanser I believe it's from clean and
An	AneesaSmith	49.829	51.84	clear it's like the yellow and purple
An	AneesaSmith	51.84	53.969	bottle just a really mild cleanser but
An	AneesaSmith	53.969	55.77	still like gets all of that gunk off my
An	AneesaSmith	55.77	58.289	face I usually do I wash my face like
An	AneesaSmith	58.289	60.75	double I wash my face like every night
An	AneesaSmith	60.75	62.28	obviously when I'm taking a shower I
An	AneesaSmith	62.28	64.229	wash it once rinse and then wash it
An	AneesaSmith	64.229	66.03	again and rinse because there's still so
An	AneesaSmith	66.03	67.86	much makeup on my face usually at the
An	AneesaSmith	67.86	70.26	end of the day um I don't go like full
An	AneesaSmith	70.26	72.39	glam makeup look every single day
An	AneesaSmith	72.39	73.83	because homegirl and got no time for
An	AneesaSmith	73.83	76.35	that but when I do take off my makeup I
An	AneesaSmith	76.35	78.03	find that like just rinsing one time
An	AneesaSmith	78.03	79.38	isn't enough but you do have to be
An	AneesaSmith	79.38	80.61	careful because some of the cleansers
An	AneesaSmith	80.61	82.799	are really really harsh on the skin I've
An	AneesaSmith	82.799	84.63	used a couple wide used one from like
An	AneesaSmith	84.63	87.45	Neutrogena which was super good and like
An	AneesaSmith	87.45	89.1	cleansed in my skin really well but it
An	AneesaSmith	89.1	90.9	was so drying that I had to stop using
An	AneesaSmith	90.9	92.7	it and I also had a reaction to it so
An	AneesaSmith	92.7	95.25	that was just a bad experience but yeah
An	AneesaSmith	95.25	96.869	I don't really have a skincare routine I
An	AneesaSmith	96.869	99.689	just use like a mild cleanser I get
An	AneesaSmith	99.689	102.09	facials every now and then and then I
An	AneesaSmith	102.09	104.31	also will like spot treat my skin
An	AneesaSmith	104.31	106.439	whenever like my skin just recently has
An	AneesaSmith	106.439	109.14	not been well at all I hardly have any
An	AneesaSmith	109.14	111.09	makeup on today and I'm also so pale
An	AneesaSmith	111.09	112.29	okay let's just talk about that for a
An	AneesaSmith	112.29	113.97	second I literally look like a ghost
An	AneesaSmith	113.97	116.579	okay but yeah I do spot treat my skin
An	AneesaSmith	116.579	119.04	where I have breakouts I use the Mario
An	AneesaSmith	119.04	121.439	Badescu which is like the most popular I
An	AneesaSmith	121.439	122.79	feel like spot treatment
An	AneesaSmith	122.79	125.07	it's from Ulta at $17 it's in a little
An	AneesaSmith	125.07	127.079	tiny little pink bottle I use that
An	AneesaSmith	127.079	129.509	overnight if I ever have any like skin
An	AneesaSmith	129.509	131.43	breakouts that are coming through or
An	AneesaSmith	131.43	131.84	that I
An	AneesaSmith	131.84	133.64	you want to get rid of in a timely
An	AneesaSmith	133.64	135.62	manner so yes that is my skincare
An	AneesaSmith	135.62	138.92	routine okay next question is what
An	AneesaSmith	138.92	141.349	message would you give to a new makeup
An	AneesaSmith	141.349	143.09	artist coming into the industry that's a
An	AneesaSmith	143.09	143.72	good question
An	AneesaSmith	143.72	145.43	my message to a new makeup artist would
An	AneesaSmith	145.43	147.62	probably have to be trying it as much
An	AneesaSmith	147.62	150.2	practice as you can I know just from
An	AneesaSmith	150.2	152.209	like when I started I started working on
An	AneesaSmith	152.209	155.09	all my really good friends and I thought
An	AneesaSmith	155.09	157.22	like wow I'm so good at this like this
An	AneesaSmith	157.22	159.92	is honestly fire right now if I go back
An	AneesaSmith	159.92	161.45	now and I look at those pictures and I'm
An	AneesaSmith	161.45	163.94	like why did anybody let me touch their
An	AneesaSmith	163.94	167.03	face ever like why but I think my advice
An	AneesaSmith	167.03	169.16	would just to be get as much would be
An	AneesaSmith	169.16	171.829	just to get what did I say would be just
An	AneesaSmith	171.829	173.45	to get as much practice as you can
An	AneesaSmith	173.45	175.64	because practice really does make
An	AneesaSmith	175.64	177.11	perfect I know that's such a cheesy line
An	AneesaSmith	177.11	178.73	but the more practice you have the more
An	AneesaSmith	178.73	180.079	experience you have working on multiple
An	AneesaSmith	180.079	182.36	faces multiple skin tones multiple skin
An	AneesaSmith	182.36	184.79	types like all of that really helps you
An	AneesaSmith	184.79	186.68	in the long run because I mean if you're
An	AneesaSmith	186.68	188.0	a makeup artist and you want to like be
An	AneesaSmith	188.0	190.099	doing you know weddings or parties or
An	AneesaSmith	190.099	192.049	events or whatever it is you're more
An	AneesaSmith	192.049	194.18	than likely gonna be working on so many
An	AneesaSmith	194.18	195.68	different faces and so many different
An	AneesaSmith	195.68	199.04	types of women that you know they're not
An	AneesaSmith	199.04	200.959	all one person is the same obviously so
An	AneesaSmith	200.959	202.94	I think just my biggest thing if you're
An	AneesaSmith	202.94	204.5	just starting out or you want to like
An	AneesaSmith	204.5	206.09	become a makeup artist is to get as much
An	AneesaSmith	206.09	207.56	practice as you can even though you're
An	AneesaSmith	207.56	208.88	probably gonna suck when you first start
An	AneesaSmith	208.88	210.709	that's totally fine because everybody
An	AneesaSmith	210.709	213.079	does I did I've always been into makeup
An	AneesaSmith	213.079	214.28	I've always been into beauty but when I
An	AneesaSmith	214.28	215.81	started doing makeup on other people I
An	AneesaSmith	215.81	217.43	was like what the hell am i doing like I
An	AneesaSmith	217.43	218.87	had no clue what I was doing and I just
An	AneesaSmith	218.87	221.06	had to learn from like experience so
An	AneesaSmith	221.06	223.16	game is not just an experience as you
An	AneesaSmith	223.16	225.319	can okay next question is what is your
An	AneesaSmith	225.319	227.359	favorite place to buy clothes honestly
An	AneesaSmith	227.359	231.019	honestly forever21 I know that's like so
An	AneesaSmith	231.019	233.81	basic and I feel like everybody shops
An	AneesaSmith	233.81	235.849	there but they had really cute clothes
An	AneesaSmith	235.849	237.169	for me I'm not really super
An	AneesaSmith	237.169	238.97	materialistic like I don't I don't know
An	AneesaSmith	238.97	240.26	mean that in a bad way I just mean like
An	AneesaSmith	240.26	242.03	I don't necessarily need like brand-name
An	AneesaSmith	242.03	244.04	stuff like I don't I'm just not that
An	AneesaSmith	244.04	247.13	kind of person I love just finding cute
An	AneesaSmith	247.13	248.959	affordable clothes where it doesn't like
An	AneesaSmith	248.959	250.609	break the bank you know ii mean and i am
An	AneesaSmith	250.609	252.319	one of the people i love shopping like
An	AneesaSmith	252.319	254.06	shopping could be a full-time job for me
An	AneesaSmith	254.06	256.519	because i do it so often but i feel like
An	AneesaSmith	256.519	258.829	i want to be able to buy new clothes
An	AneesaSmith	258.829	260.78	often and not feel like well i'm
An	AneesaSmith	260.78	262.25	spending three hundred and fifty dollars
An	AneesaSmith	262.25	264.05	every time i go to the mall every time i
An	AneesaSmith	264.05	264.5	go shop
An	AneesaSmith	264.5	265.82	you know and I feel like forever twenty-one has
An	AneesaSmith	265.82	267.74	really really really cute stuff at a
An	AneesaSmith	267.74	269.72	really good price point so I usually buy
An	AneesaSmith	269.72	272.54	all of my clothes there I also do a lot
An	AneesaSmith	272.54	274.67	of shopping at Ross and Marshalls and TJ
An	AneesaSmith	274.67	278.3	Maxx stores like that and I feel like I
An	AneesaSmith	278.3	279.56	feel like they have like a bat you know
An	AneesaSmith	279.56	280.85	what I mean they were like oh you shop
An	AneesaSmith	280.85	282.83	at Ross like this yeah I do got my Ross
An	AneesaSmith	282.83	283.88	because they have a really cute stuff
An	AneesaSmith	283.88	285.56	and most the time I'm wearing stuff on
An	AneesaSmith	285.56	287.15	camera or like in a video or whatever
An	AneesaSmith	287.15	288.26	and you guys like oh my gosh where'd you
An	AneesaSmith	288.26	290.63	get that and I'm like Ross so they just
An	AneesaSmith	290.63	292.52	have really good stuff and also at a
An	AneesaSmith	292.52	293.9	very good price line in my opinion but
An	AneesaSmith	293.9	295.64	my I think my all-time favorite store is
An	AneesaSmith	295.64	298.34	forever twenty-one next question what is the
An	AneesaSmith	298.34	300.77	most important thing that you look for
An	AneesaSmith	300.77	303.58	on a client before doing their makeup um
An	AneesaSmith	303.58	306.44	that's a good one I think the one thing
An	AneesaSmith	306.44	308.66	that I look at like first and foremost
An	AneesaSmith	308.66	310.97	is their skin type because most the time
An	AneesaSmith	310.97	313.34	like if they have like dry skin I like
An	AneesaSmith	313.34	315.38	to prep the skin I always start with eye
An	AneesaSmith	315.38	317.51	makeup so no matter who I'm working on I
An	AneesaSmith	317.51	318.98	always do their eyes first because I
An	AneesaSmith	318.98	320.9	like to avoid like fall out if I'm doing
An	AneesaSmith	320.9	322.49	like a dark look or whatever but I
An	AneesaSmith	322.49	324.05	always look at the person's skin because
An	AneesaSmith	324.05	325.76	if they have dry skin I like to prep it
An	AneesaSmith	325.76	327.41	before so I'll put a moisturizer let
An	AneesaSmith	327.41	329.36	that kind of sink and soak in I'll put a
An	AneesaSmith	329.36	331.19	primer let that kind of like work its
An	AneesaSmith	331.19	333.56	way work itself in there and then by the
An	AneesaSmith	333.56	335.63	time I get to their face their face like
An	AneesaSmith	335.63	336.89	prepped and primed and ready to go if
An	AneesaSmith	336.89	338.36	that makes sense so I think definitely
An	AneesaSmith	338.36	340.64	looking at the person's skin is the
An	AneesaSmith	340.64	342.77	first thing that I do okay this person
An	AneesaSmith	342.77	344.63	asked what is your eyebrow routine your
An	AneesaSmith	344.63	346.25	yours always look amazing
An	AneesaSmith	346.25	348.68	so I actually get a lot of questions
An	AneesaSmith	348.68	350.12	about my eyebrows and I don't know if
An	AneesaSmith	350.12	351.44	I've said this on my channel before or
An	AneesaSmith	351.44	353.84	not but I used to have and let's just
An	AneesaSmith	353.84	355.46	okay we can just like I think you can
An	AneesaSmith	355.46	357.35	same I know I have a hat on but I used
An	AneesaSmith	357.35	359.51	to have a unibrow when I was little yes
An	AneesaSmith	359.51	361.25	I know I'm just letting it all out right
An	AneesaSmith	361.25	363.08	now also if you look on my Instagram
An	AneesaSmith	363.08	365.06	page I think it's kind of a bit farther
An	AneesaSmith	365.06	368.3	down but I did this whole post about
An	AneesaSmith	368.3	370.37	like my eyebrow transformation 30 years
An	AneesaSmith	370.37	373.19	they were so hideous like I had full
An	AneesaSmith	373.19	375.11	really really really full eyebrows and
An	AneesaSmith	375.11	376.729	then I plucked them and cut them and
An	AneesaSmith	376.729	378.38	trimmed them and they were lines I
An	AneesaSmith	378.38	379.97	basically did everything that you're not
An	AneesaSmith	379.97	381.8	supposed to do to my own eyebrows and I
An	AneesaSmith	381.8	383.24	thought they looked so good I just
An	AneesaSmith	383.24	385.58	didn't want to have a unibrow anymore so
An	AneesaSmith	385.58	387.11	I just tried everything I possibly could
An	AneesaSmith	387.11	389.39	to get rid of them but now they have
An	AneesaSmith	389.39	391.16	obviously grown back and they're not
An	AneesaSmith	391.16	394.55	lying face but I get them to get the
An	AneesaSmith	394.55	397.64	shape of my eyebrows I did threading so
An	AneesaSmith	397.64	398.99	I got I went to like one of those little
An	AneesaSmith	398.99	400.4	threading places and got the shape and
An	AneesaSmith	400.4	401.93	they I feel like the threading places
An	AneesaSmith	401.93	403.55	like shape them really well I don't I
An	AneesaSmith	403.55	404.48	couldn't tell you the name of the place
An	AneesaSmith	404.48	406.85	I went to is out of my bird now I pretty
An	AneesaSmith	406.85	408.71	much keep them up on my own every now
An	AneesaSmith	408.71	410.6	and then I will get them waxed just like
An	AneesaSmith	410.6	412.28	really get a nice cleaning but for the
An	AneesaSmith	412.28	414.17	most part I use those little like tinkle
An	AneesaSmith	414.17	416.09	twinkle razor things I think they're
An	AneesaSmith	416.09	418.25	called tinkle tinkle that sounds weird
An	AneesaSmith	418.25	419.18	but I'm pretty sure they're called
An	AneesaSmith	419.18	420.5	tinkle razors and they're just like they
An	AneesaSmith	420.5	422.21	kind of like will clean up your eyebrows
An	AneesaSmith	422.21	424.01	like your eyebrow hairs and stuff and
An	AneesaSmith	424.01	425.42	then I just pluck the ones that are like
An	AneesaSmith	425.42	428.36	too hard to get with that but um yeah I
An	AneesaSmith	428.36	430.31	just I have a really the girl who does
An	AneesaSmith	430.31	432.56	my eyebrows her name is Olivia I will
An	AneesaSmith	432.56	434.33	leave her contact information in the
An	AneesaSmith	434.33	436.34	description box below but she does a
An	AneesaSmith	436.34	437.84	really good job she's a really good job
An	AneesaSmith	437.84	440.06	shaping them and just like filling them
An	AneesaSmith	440.06	441.86	in and like making them like the shape
An	AneesaSmith	441.86	442.55	that I want
An	AneesaSmith	442.55	444.74	so I mean definitely having a good eye
An	AneesaSmith	444.74	446.12	brow specialist
An	AneesaSmith	446.12	448.76	is good but um as far as filling them in
An	AneesaSmith	448.76	451.22	I usually just use like a pencil I will
An	AneesaSmith	451.22	454.01	fill in like the sparse areas and then
An	AneesaSmith	454.01	456.02	I'll go in with a powder and just like
An	AneesaSmith	456.02	458.45	fill in with a powder so that's what I
An	AneesaSmith	458.45	460.37	do okay next question is how long have
An	AneesaSmith	460.37	462.26	you been doing makeup I have been doing
An	AneesaSmith	462.26	465.53	makeup um I started in January of 2015
An	AneesaSmith	465.53	468.02	so just over three years I've been
An	AneesaSmith	468.02	469.37	working on bridal parties and I'm pretty
An	AneesaSmith	469.37	472.46	sure for just over two years um I wanted
An	AneesaSmith	472.46	473.87	to try and get as much experience as I
An	AneesaSmith	473.87	476.18	could before I like went full-on in to
An	AneesaSmith	476.18	477.95	like doing Bridal parties and we a
An	AneesaSmith	477.95	479.06	wedding makeup and stuff like that
An	AneesaSmith	479.06	481.84	because that was like a huge step for me
An	AneesaSmith	481.84	484.19	but yeah I've been doing makeup since
An	AneesaSmith	484.19	485.18	January 2015
An	AneesaSmith	485.18	487.16	is when I like started my journey that's
An	AneesaSmith	487.16	488.36	when I was like this is what I want to
An	AneesaSmith	488.36	489.92	do this is what I'm gonna do and then I
An	AneesaSmith	489.92	492.62	went for it okay next question is um oh
An	AneesaSmith	492.62	495.62	wait she has three what is your favorite
An	AneesaSmith	495.62	500.06	store to shop at um oh my gosh I love
An	AneesaSmith	500.06	501.74	forever twenty-one like I said I really really
An	AneesaSmith	501.74	505.01	love that but I also love I love Hobby
An	AneesaSmith	505.01	509.54	Lobby and I love I love like Marshalls
An	AneesaSmith	509.54	510.86	and tjmaxx because they just have
An	AneesaSmith	510.86	512.599	everything but I also obviously love
An	AneesaSmith	512.599	514.25	Target I'm just such a target girl I'm a
An	AneesaSmith	514.25	517.219	target a holic that's I just made that
An	AneesaSmith	517.219	519.83	up what tips do you have for ladies who
An	AneesaSmith	519.83	521.63	want to start freelancing
An	AneesaSmith	521.63	524.36	that's a good question um I think if I
An	AneesaSmith	524.36	526.519	had tips my first tip would be to save
An	AneesaSmith	526.519	527.75	your money because makeup is so
An	AneesaSmith	527.75	529.91	expensive and especially if you want to
An	AneesaSmith	529.91	531.199	have like a kit and you want to like be
An	AneesaSmith	531.199	532.699	working on other people makeup is a not
An	AneesaSmith	532.699	534.73	cheap I can't even tell you how many
An	AneesaSmith	534.73	537.92	many many dollars I've spent on makeup
An	AneesaSmith	537.92	539.569	and stuff like that because you have to
An	AneesaSmith	539.569	541.009	take into consideration you have to get
An	AneesaSmith	541.009	542.18	different colors you have to get
An	AneesaSmith	542.18	543.41	different you know like foundation
An	AneesaSmith	543.41	545.3	shades concealer shades you have to get
An	AneesaSmith	545.3	547.13	bunch of different palettes and you know
An	AneesaSmith	547.13	549.199	you try to get I mean you try to get as
An	AneesaSmith	549.199	550.699	many things as you can to be like as a
An	AneesaSmith	550.699	552.38	versatile as you can possibly be because
An	AneesaSmith	552.38	553.55	you're gonna be working on so many
An	AneesaSmith	553.55	555.29	different people so my first tip would
An	AneesaSmith	555.29	557.36	probably be to save your money because
An	AneesaSmith	557.36	559.579	it's expensive and it's a very it's a
An	AneesaSmith	559.579	562.459	very expensive hobby turned into which
An	AneesaSmith	562.459	564.079	can turn into a job if that's what
An	AneesaSmith	564.079	566.54	you're wanting to go for so definitely
An	AneesaSmith	566.54	567.8	save your money and also like I said
An	AneesaSmith	567.8	569.66	earlier get as much experience as you
An	AneesaSmith	569.66	572.449	can my biggest thing is people sometimes
An	AneesaSmith	572.449	573.74	ask me this they're like how much should
An	AneesaSmith	573.74	575.449	I start charging like I'm just starting
An	AneesaSmith	575.449	577.04	out ah don't charge them anything
An	AneesaSmith	577.04	578.12	because if you don't know what you're
An	AneesaSmith	578.12	579.44	doing I feel like that's kind of not
An	AneesaSmith	579.44	581.569	fair for you to be like charging at the
An	AneesaSmith	581.569	583.25	same time I understand that makeup costs
An	AneesaSmith	583.25	584.87	money but when I first started
An	AneesaSmith	584.87	586.55	freelancing I would have people bring me
An	AneesaSmith	586.55	588.35	all of their own products and like the
An	AneesaSmith	588.35	589.519	problem with that sometimes too is
An	AneesaSmith	589.519	590.839	people don't have the right stuff like
An	AneesaSmith	590.839	591.68	maybe they don't have the right color
An	AneesaSmith	591.68	593.089	maybe I don't have that shade for their
An	AneesaSmith	593.089	595.31	like skin tone it happens but if you're
An	AneesaSmith	595.31	596.839	trying to like just get the experience
An	AneesaSmith	596.839	598.189	of working with different products and
An	AneesaSmith	598.189	599.569	different people and different faces I
An	AneesaSmith	599.569	602.899	would say have them don't charge them
An	AneesaSmith	602.899	605.779	first of all but then I would say to you
An	AneesaSmith	605.779	607.91	know have used their stuff instead of
An	AneesaSmith	607.91	609.709	like buying a crap ton of stuff and like
An	AneesaSmith	609.709	611.509	not really maybe not knowing at what to
An	AneesaSmith	611.509	613.13	do with it yet sorry there was something
An	AneesaSmith	613.13	615.05	floating right here but I would say use
An	AneesaSmith	615.05	617.029	the clients products use the stuff that
An	AneesaSmith	617.029	618.68	they have so then they that way they can
An	AneesaSmith	618.68	621.17	learn to use like what they have so they
An	AneesaSmith	621.17	622.25	don't have to say it you don't have to
An	AneesaSmith	622.25	623.899	tell them like okay here's what you need
An	AneesaSmith	623.899	625.819	go out and spend $500 on like all this
An	AneesaSmith	625.819	627.86	stuff because you know it's expensive so
An	AneesaSmith	627.86	629.75	that's how II what I would say is I I
An	AneesaSmith	629.75	631.22	didn't charge people when I first
An	AneesaSmith	631.22	633.05	started because I just didn't I didn't
An	AneesaSmith	633.05	634.339	know what I was doing you know so I
An	AneesaSmith	634.339	635.839	wanted to just get that experience
An	AneesaSmith	635.839	638.089	before I was like okay fork it over you
An	AneesaSmith	638.089	639.74	know that I mean just I mean things to
An	AneesaSmith	639.74	640.1	think about
An	AneesaSmith	640.1	642.68	alrighty the next question is I love the
An	AneesaSmith	642.68	644.3	week to makeup how did you how did you
An	AneesaSmith	644.3	645.62	get inspired to start doing makeup for
An	AneesaSmith	645.62	647.66	others thank you I got started doing
An	AneesaSmith	647.66	649.33	makeup like I said in
An	AneesaSmith	649.33	651.55	about 300 just over three years ago and
An	AneesaSmith	651.55	654.25	I was actually in the Target aisle and I
An	AneesaSmith	654.25	656.11	was just like I was I had to buy like
An	AneesaSmith	656.11	657.399	new makeup and stuff because that was
An	AneesaSmith	657.399	659.2	the one I bought all my stuff at oh my
An	AneesaSmith	659.2	661.57	god my gosh yeah sorry that's when I
An	AneesaSmith	661.57	663.73	bought all my makeup at the drugstore
An	AneesaSmith	663.73	665.649	like just at Target and I was standing
An	AneesaSmith	665.649	666.91	in the aisle and I thought you know I
An	AneesaSmith	666.91	668.44	think it'd be really fun to just like
An	AneesaSmith	668.44	670.81	buy new stuff like I'm just gonna throw
An	AneesaSmith	670.81	672.64	everything I have and I'm just gonna
An	AneesaSmith	672.64	674.11	start over like I'm just gonna buy new
An	AneesaSmith	674.11	675.76	product and just like try it out and see
An	AneesaSmith	675.76	676.839	how I like it and all that stuff just
An	AneesaSmith	676.839	678.399	kind of experiment with new things and
An	AneesaSmith	678.399	680.14	so I went home and I like was trying on
An	AneesaSmith	680.14	681.31	all this makeup and I thought wow this
An	AneesaSmith	681.31	683.02	is like so much fun like finding new
An	AneesaSmith	683.02	684.61	stuff and like figuring out like new
An	AneesaSmith	684.61	686.23	ways to do things and like new products
An	AneesaSmith	686.23	687.61	to use and I think that's kind of what
An	AneesaSmith	687.61	689.56	like made me feel like I kind of want to
An	AneesaSmith	689.56	691.149	start doing this like on regular basis
An	AneesaSmith	691.149	692.8	like if I started working on people and
An	AneesaSmith	692.8	694.81	like I knew that I was gonna I knew that
An	AneesaSmith	694.81	696.43	I was gonna have to figure out like
An	AneesaSmith	696.43	698.14	different ways to do things and I loved
An	AneesaSmith	698.14	699.37	like learning I feel like that's what I
An	AneesaSmith	699.37	700.75	love the most about makeup is because
An	AneesaSmith	700.75	702.37	it's just it's never one thing it's
An	AneesaSmith	702.37	703.63	always changing it's always like
An	AneesaSmith	703.63	705.399	something new it's always planets always
An	AneesaSmith	705.399	706.99	exciting and there's always so much to
An	AneesaSmith	706.99	708.58	learn like I feel like I just never
An	AneesaSmith	708.58	710.47	stopped learning in this industry like
An	AneesaSmith	710.47	713.56	which is so cool and I think I think
An	AneesaSmith	713.56	715.39	that's probably what started like what
An	AneesaSmith	715.39	717.76	made me want to start doing people
An	AneesaSmith	717.76	719.709	makeup on other people is just the fact
An	AneesaSmith	719.709	721.12	that I wanted to like learn more about
An	AneesaSmith	721.12	723.43	how to do stuff and I obviously love
An	AneesaSmith	723.43	725.5	makeup I love applying it on people on
An	AneesaSmith	725.5	727.24	myself I love doing videos and some like
An	AneesaSmith	727.24	728.529	that I think I wanted to just find out
An	AneesaSmith	728.529	730.779	you know how how I could better myself
An	AneesaSmith	730.779	732.91	and how I could better the skill and the
An	AneesaSmith	732.91	735.13	skills that you that I need to do makeup
An	AneesaSmith	735.13	737.589	so I think that's probably why okay next
An	AneesaSmith	737.589	739.209	question is how did you first get into
An	AneesaSmith	739.209	740.68	freelancing what are some tips you've
An	AneesaSmith	740.68	741.91	learned along the way regarding
An	AneesaSmith	741.91	743.05	freelancing and being prepared for
An	AneesaSmith	743.05	744.67	clients I feel like some tips that I've
An	AneesaSmith	744.67	749.079	learned is to really plan ahead I feel
An	AneesaSmith	749.079	750.49	like once I have like a wedding coming
An	AneesaSmith	750.49	751.99	up I'm like that whole week I'm like
An	AneesaSmith	751.99	753.339	okay do I have this do I have this I
An	AneesaSmith	753.339	754.48	have this do I have this drive enough
An	AneesaSmith	754.48	755.98	lashes do I have enough mascara do i
An	AneesaSmith	755.98	757.36	havnt hope you know like you just always
An	AneesaSmith	757.36	758.86	are trying to like go over everything in
An	AneesaSmith	758.86	761.17	your head um but I definitely would say
An	AneesaSmith	761.17	763.27	like being prepared and if you're not
An	AneesaSmith	763.27	765.07	like an organized person like start
An	AneesaSmith	765.07	766.6	trying to be organized because once you
An	AneesaSmith	766.6	769.029	go out and you're freelancing and people
An	AneesaSmith	769.029	770.8	are relying on you for something I was
An	AneesaSmith	770.8	772.06	like big is like getting them ready for
An	AneesaSmith	772.06	773.35	their wedding or getting them ready for
An	AneesaSmith	773.35	774.79	prom we're getting ready for formal or
An	AneesaSmith	774.79	776.589	whatever it may be it's like a lot of
An	AneesaSmith	776.589	777.47	pressure and it can be
An	AneesaSmith	777.47	779.12	pressure and when I first started I was
An	AneesaSmith	779.12	780.53	always like Oh am i doing it right like
An	AneesaSmith	780.53	782.27	am i okay like you know I was trying to
An	AneesaSmith	782.27	783.38	like I haven't I always second-guessing
An	AneesaSmith	783.38	786.47	myself but I think some tips I'm like I
An	AneesaSmith	786.47	787.64	kind of mentioned earlier is to like
An	AneesaSmith	787.64	788.84	save your money if you want to do
An	AneesaSmith	788.84	790.7	freelancing it costs a lot of money as
An	AneesaSmith	790.7	793.43	like a startup thing because you need so
An	AneesaSmith	793.43	795.08	much product and you need so many like
An	AneesaSmith	795.08	798.2	so many things of everything like you
An	AneesaSmith	798.2	799.91	just need multiples it's like you're
An	AneesaSmith	799.91	801.53	buying the stuff in bulk it's literally
An	AneesaSmith	801.53	803.42	like I have I can't even tell you how
An	AneesaSmith	803.42	805.07	many foundation tubes I have in these
An	AneesaSmith	805.07	806.54	drawers like it's ridiculous
An	AneesaSmith	806.54	808.66	but you just have to really be prepared
An	AneesaSmith	808.66	810.83	with for like how much money you're
An	AneesaSmith	810.83	812.0	gonna spend if this is something that
An	AneesaSmith	812.0	814.91	you want to get into it's not cheap the
An	AneesaSmith	814.91	817.42	more experience you get the more you can
An	AneesaSmith	817.42	819.56	obviously like you can start charging
An	AneesaSmith	819.56	821.12	people you can I and I wouldn't like I
An	AneesaSmith	821.12	823.67	think when I first started I charge like
An	AneesaSmith	823.67	826.58	oh my gosh like 35 or 40 dollars like
An	AneesaSmith	826.58	828.59	and that was like the base like this is
An	AneesaSmith	828.59	830.51	you know you can have me do whatever you
An	AneesaSmith	830.51	832.85	want and like now obviously years later
An	AneesaSmith	832.85	834.77	my prices have changed but you have to
An	AneesaSmith	834.77	837.47	you have to be really realistic when you
An	AneesaSmith	837.47	839.06	first start out in my opinion because
An	AneesaSmith	839.06	841.28	you can't be like okay day one I'm gonna
An	AneesaSmith	841.28	842.63	be a makeup artist today and I'm gonna
An	AneesaSmith	842.63	844.43	charge $125 like you just doesn't work
An	AneesaSmith	844.43	845.6	like that because people are not gonna
An	AneesaSmith	845.6	846.92	like people are not gonna pay that but I
An	AneesaSmith	846.92	848.0	think yeah those are probably my two
An	AneesaSmith	848.0	850.61	biggest tips another tip that I really
An	AneesaSmith	850.61	852.71	have is to take pictures of your work
An	AneesaSmith	852.71	854.75	because I think that's how I mean that
An	AneesaSmith	854.75	857.3	is how like I came to be like where I'm
An	AneesaSmith	857.3	859.49	at now it's through Instagram and people
An	AneesaSmith	859.49	860.75	you know some of my friends are always
An	AneesaSmith	860.75	862.43	like why do you take in scams seriously
An	AneesaSmith	862.43	863.75	like you're so dumb and I'm like um
An	AneesaSmith	863.75	865.64	because that's my job it's literally my
An	AneesaSmith	865.64	867.02	job that's how I make money and it's
An	AneesaSmith	867.02	868.73	like through Instagram I'm not like
An	AneesaSmith	868.73	870.05	literally through Instagram but because
An	AneesaSmith	870.05	871.94	I post pictures of clients and like you
An	AneesaSmith	871.94	873.98	know whatever I'm doing you know people
An	AneesaSmith	873.98	875.0	really get to know you through social
An	AneesaSmith	875.0	876.5	media they really get to see your work
An	AneesaSmith	876.5	878.45	like firsthand so I think that's
An	AneesaSmith	878.45	880.1	definitely like if you want to like take
An	AneesaSmith	880.1	881.45	this thing seriously you want to be a
An	AneesaSmith	881.45	883.19	freelance makeup artist I'd create a cat
An	AneesaSmith	883.19	884.9	create an account create your own like
An	AneesaSmith	884.9	886.58	personal Beauty account like I I
An	AneesaSmith	886.58	888.98	wouldn't I don't know I have mixed
An	AneesaSmith	888.98	890.63	feelings about like linking it to like
An	AneesaSmith	890.63	891.92	your main account like if you're just
An	AneesaSmith	891.92	893.45	like posting about I here no longer you
An	AneesaSmith	893.45	895.46	know on a Tuesday like I think if people
An	AneesaSmith	895.46	897.11	are gonna want to like see your work
An	AneesaSmith	897.11	898.46	work like you should have something
An	AneesaSmith	898.46	900.77	separate that's what I kind of did when
An	AneesaSmith	900.77	902.39	I first started like I just had my
An	AneesaSmith	902.39	903.89	makeup page I didn't have like another
An	AneesaSmith	903.89	905.329	Instagram and now like I
An	AneesaSmith	905.329	907.189	kind of like I kind of mix things every
An	AneesaSmith	907.189	909.139	now and then but I have like my one for
An	AneesaSmith	909.139	911.119	like here is my work makeup here is my
An	AneesaSmith	911.119	912.47	work Instagram and then I have another
An	AneesaSmith	912.47	914.629	one where it's like here's my Tuesday
An	AneesaSmith	914.629	916.189	but definitely utilizing social media
An	AneesaSmith	916.189	918.439	was so big and so important for me and
An	AneesaSmith	918.439	920.809	really really helped me tremendously and
An	AneesaSmith	920.809	922.369	getting my name out there and having
An	AneesaSmith	922.369	924.17	other people see my work and having you
An	AneesaSmith	924.17	926.299	know that's that's just how I built up I
An	AneesaSmith	926.299	928.069	wouldn't say it clientele because it's
An	AneesaSmith	928.069	929.509	not necessarily like I don't have too
An	AneesaSmith	929.509	931.009	many repeat clients just because like
An	AneesaSmith	931.009	932.48	you really don't get your makeup done
An	AneesaSmith	932.48	934.999	for like a wedding like multiple times I
An	AneesaSmith	934.999	936.709	mean maybe you do but like I mean think
An	AneesaSmith	936.709	938.239	about if you're a bridal party like how
An	AneesaSmith	938.239	939.649	many how many weddings are you really
An	AneesaSmith	939.649	940.91	and you didn't mean like you just don't
An	AneesaSmith	940.91	942.17	know like it's not like hair or you have
An	AneesaSmith	942.17	943.579	to get it done like every three months I
An	AneesaSmith	943.579	944.66	think it was kind of a little bit
An	AneesaSmith	944.66	946.97	different but like I did get my name out
An	AneesaSmith	946.97	948.799	there and people started knowing me more
An	AneesaSmith	948.799	950.48	because of social media so I would
An	AneesaSmith	950.48	952.189	definitely say to utilize social media
An	AneesaSmith	952.189	954.11	as well okay just a few more questions
An	AneesaSmith	954.11	957.019	here um I have a question about spray
An	AneesaSmith	957.019	958.639	tans I really get them so I never know
An	AneesaSmith	958.639	960.949	what's the best way to prep your skin
An	AneesaSmith	960.949	963.559	for them what do you suggest okay so I
An	AneesaSmith	963.559	966.529	get spray tans very regularly what I do
An	AneesaSmith	966.529	970.089	is I make sure to exfoliate my skin too
An	AneesaSmith	970.089	973.579	how do I say this the two days before I
An	AneesaSmith	973.579	975.259	get my spray tan so like typically I get
An	AneesaSmith	975.259	976.73	my spray tans on Thursday so I'll make
An	AneesaSmith	976.73	978.169	sure to exfoliate my skin in the shower
An	AneesaSmith	978.169	980.419	on Tuesday and on Wednesday night and
An	AneesaSmith	980.419	983.149	then I usually just shave like the night
An	AneesaSmith	983.149	986.66	before so I'll exploit my skin and
An	AneesaSmith	986.66	988.85	everything on Tuesday and then I will
An	AneesaSmith	988.85	991.519	exfoliate and shave also on Wednesday
An	AneesaSmith	991.519	994.369	that's like the best way I got that's
An	AneesaSmith	994.369	997.069	how it works for me isolating your skin
An	AneesaSmith	997.069	998.929	and like obviously shaving is just gonna
An	AneesaSmith	998.929	1001.119	make everything go on smoother I'm not
An	AneesaSmith	1001.119	1002.949	like a skincare expert so I really don't
An	AneesaSmith	1002.949	1004.179	know like the technical terms for
An	AneesaSmith	1004.179	1006.85	everything but I do know that exfoliant
An	AneesaSmith	1006.85	1008.98	really helps this the tan to like stick
An	AneesaSmith	1008.98	1011.829	to your skin better and I exfoliate too
An	AneesaSmith	1011.829	1014.139	primarily because I have a tan on from
An	AneesaSmith	1014.139	1016.389	like before like I already have a little
An	AneesaSmith	1016.389	1017.98	bit of like tan like I can usually
An	AneesaSmith	1017.98	1019.72	always see it like on my arms right here
An	AneesaSmith	1019.72	1021.279	I don't know if like you can really see
An	AneesaSmith	1021.279	1022.929	it but like you see that gets white
An	AneesaSmith	1022.929	1024.73	right here and then it's like dark it's
An	AneesaSmith	1024.73	1026.289	because that's like it's a tan so I
An	AneesaSmith	1026.289	1028.689	tried like exploit my skin so that this
An	AneesaSmith	1028.689	1030.579	that new tan will stay on and to also
An	AneesaSmith	1030.579	1033.339	get rid of the old tan so that's what I
