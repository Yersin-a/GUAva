hi guys welcome back it's so annoying let's do that again I don't know how to start this hey guys welcome back to my channel that's much better for today's video I am going to be doing a question and answer video I had you guys ask me questions last night on my Instagram if you guys don't follow me on Instagram yet my Instagram name is a right here but yeah I had you guys ask you some questions that you want answers to on my Instagram last night so this video is going to be answering all of those questions so without further ado first question is what is my skincare routine um well I don't have a skincare routine I know that sounds bad this skincare routine that I have had doesn't consist of a whole lot I use a just like a mild cleanser I believe it's from clean and clear it's like the yellow and purple bottle just a really mild cleanser but still like gets all of that gunk off my face I usually do I wash my face like double I wash my face like every night obviously when I'm taking a shower I wash it once rinse and then wash it again and rinse because there's still so much makeup on my face usually at the end of the day um I don't go like full glam makeup look every single day because homegirl and got no time for that but when I do take off my makeup I find that like just rinsing one time isn't enough but you do have to be careful because some of the cleansers are really really harsh on the skin I've used a couple wide used one from like Neutrogena which was super good and like cleansed in my skin really well but it was so drying that I had to stop using it and I also had a reaction to it so that was just a bad experience but yeah I don't really have a skincare routine I just use like a mild cleanser I get facials every now and then and then I also will like spot treat my skin whenever like my skin just recently has not been well at all I hardly have any makeup on today and I'm also so pale okay let's just talk about that for a second I literally look like a ghost okay but yeah I do spot treat my skin where I have breakouts I use the Mario Badescu which is like the most popular I feel like spot treatment it's from Ulta at $17 it's in a little tiny little pink bottle I use that overnight if I ever have any like skin breakouts that are coming through or that I you want to get rid of in a timely manner so yes that is my skincare routine okay next question is what message would you give to a new makeup artist coming into the industry that's a good question my message to a new makeup artist would probably have to be trying it as much practice as you can I know just from like when I started I started working on all my really good friends and I thought like wow I'm so good at this like this is honestly fire right now if I go back now and I look at those pictures and I'm like why did anybody let me touch their face ever like why but I think my advice would just to be get as much would be just to get what did I say would be just to get as much practice as you can because practice really does make perfect I know that's such a cheesy line but the more practice you have the more experience you have working on multiple faces multiple skin tones multiple skin types like all of that really helps you in the long run because I mean if you're a makeup artist and you want to like be doing you know weddings or parties or events or whatever it is you're more than likely gonna be working on so many different faces and so many different types of women that you know they're not all one person is the same obviously so I think just my biggest thing if you're just starting out or you want to like become a makeup artist is to get as much practice as you can even though you're probably gonna suck when you first start that's totally fine because everybody does I did I've always been into makeup I've always been into beauty but when I started doing makeup on other people I was like what the hell am i doing like I had no clue what I was doing and I just had to learn from like experience so game is not just an experience as you can okay next question is what is your favorite place to buy clothes honestly honestly forever21 I know that's like so basic and I feel like everybody shops there but they had really cute clothes for me I'm not really super materialistic like I don't I don't know mean that in a bad way I just mean like I don't necessarily need like brand-name stuff like I don't I'm just not that kind of person I love just finding cute affordable clothes where it doesn't like break the bank you know ii mean and i am one of the people i love shopping like shopping could be a full-time job for me because i do it so often but i feel like i want to be able to buy new clothes often and not feel like well i'm spending three hundred and fifty dollars every time i go to the mall every time i go shop you know and I feel like forever twenty-one has really really really cute stuff at a really good price point so I usually buy all of my clothes there I also do a lot of shopping at Ross and Marshalls and TJ Maxx stores like that and I feel like I feel like they have like a bat you know what I mean they were like oh you shop at Ross like this yeah I do got my Ross because they have a really cute stuff and most the time I'm wearing stuff on camera or like in a video or whatever and you guys like oh my gosh where'd you get that and I'm like Ross so they just have really good stuff and also at a very good price line in my opinion but my I think my all-time favorite store is forever twenty-one next question what is the most important thing that you look for on a client before doing their makeup um that's a good one I think the one thing that I look at like first and foremost is their skin type because most the time like if they have like dry skin I like to prep the skin I always start with eye makeup so no matter who I'm working on I always do their eyes first because I like to avoid like fall out if I'm doing like a dark look or whatever but I always look at the person's skin because if they have dry skin I like to prep it before so I'll put a moisturizer let that kind of sink and soak in I'll put a primer let that kind of like work its way work itself in there and then by the time I get to their face their face like prepped and primed and ready to go if that makes sense so I think definitely looking at the person's skin is the first thing that I do okay this person asked what is your eyebrow routine your yours always look amazing so I actually get a lot of questions about my eyebrows and I don't know if I've said this on my channel before or not but I used to have and let's just okay we can just like I think you can same I know I have a hat on but I used to have a unibrow when I was little yes I know I'm just letting it all out right now also if you look on my Instagram page I think it's kind of a bit farther down but I did this whole post about like my eyebrow transformation 30 years they were so hideous like I had full really really really full eyebrows and then I plucked them and cut them and trimmed them and they were lines I basically did everything that you're not supposed to do to my own eyebrows and I thought they looked so good I just didn't want to have a unibrow anymore so I just tried everything I possibly could to get rid of them but now they have obviously grown back and they're not lying face but I get them to get the shape of my eyebrows I did threading so I got I went to like one of those little threading places and got the shape and they I feel like the threading places like shape them really well I don't I couldn't tell you the name of the place I went to is out of my bird now I pretty much keep them up on my own every now and then I will get them waxed just like really get a nice cleaning but for the most part I use those little like tinkle twinkle razor things I think they're called tinkle tinkle that sounds weird but I'm pretty sure they're called tinkle razors and they're just like they kind of like will clean up your eyebrows like your eyebrow hairs and stuff and then I just pluck the ones that are like too hard to get with that but um yeah I just I have a really the girl who does my eyebrows her name is Olivia I will leave her contact information in the description box below but she does a really good job she's a really good job shaping them and just like filling them in and like making them like the shape that I want so I mean definitely having a good eye brow specialist is good but um as far as filling them in I usually just use like a pencil I will fill in like the sparse areas and then I'll go in with a powder and just like fill in with a powder so that's what I do okay next question is how long have you been doing makeup I have been doing makeup um I started in January of 2015 so just over three years I've been working on bridal parties and I'm pretty sure for just over two years um I wanted to try and get as much experience as I could before I like went full-on in to like doing Bridal parties and we a wedding makeup and stuff like that because that was like a huge step for me but yeah I've been doing makeup since January 2015 is when I like started my journey that's when I was like this is what I want to do this is what I'm gonna do and then I went for it okay next question is um oh wait she has three what is your favorite store to shop at um oh my gosh I love forever twenty-one like I said I really really love that but I also love I love Hobby Lobby and I love I love like Marshalls and tjmaxx because they just have everything but I also obviously love Target I'm just such a target girl I'm a target a holic that's I just made that up what tips do you have for ladies who want to start freelancing that's a good question um I think if I had tips my first tip would be to save your money because makeup is so expensive and especially if you want to have like a kit and you want to like be working on other people makeup is a not cheap I can't even tell you how many many many dollars I've spent on makeup and stuff like that because you have to take into consideration you have to get different colors you have to get different you know like foundation shades concealer shades you have to get bunch of different palettes and you know you try to get I mean you try to get as many things as you can to be like as a versatile as you can possibly be because you're gonna be working on so many different people so my first tip would probably be to save your money because it's expensive and it's a very it's a very expensive hobby turned into which can turn into a job if that's what you're wanting to go for so definitely save your money and also like I said earlier get as much experience as you can my biggest thing is people sometimes ask me this they're like how much should I start charging like I'm just starting out ah don't charge them anything because if you don't know what you're doing I feel like that's kind of not fair for you to be like charging at the same time I understand that makeup costs money but when I first started freelancing I would have people bring me all of their own products and like the problem with that sometimes too is people don't have the right stuff like maybe they don't have the right color maybe I don't have that shade for their like skin tone it happens but if you're trying to like just get the experience of working with different products and different people and different faces I would say have them don't charge them first of all but then I would say to you know have used their stuff instead of like buying a crap ton of stuff and like not really maybe not knowing at what to do with it yet sorry there was something floating right here but I would say use the clients products use the stuff that they have so then they that way they can learn to use like what they have so they don't have to say it you don't have to tell them like okay here's what you need go out and spend $500 on like all this stuff because you know it's expensive so that's how II what I would say is I I didn't charge people when I first started because I just didn't I didn't know what I was doing you know so I wanted to just get that experience before I was like okay fork it over you know that I mean just I mean things to think about alrighty the next question is I love the week to makeup how did you how did you get inspired to start doing makeup for others thank you I got started doing makeup like I said in about 300 just over three years ago and I was actually in the Target aisle and I was just like I was I had to buy like new makeup and stuff because that was the one I bought all my stuff at oh my god my gosh yeah sorry that's when I bought all my makeup at the drugstore like just at Target and I was standing in the aisle and I thought you know I think it'd be really fun to just like buy new stuff like I'm just gonna throw everything I have and I'm just gonna start over like I'm just gonna buy new product and just like try it out and see how I like it and all that stuff just kind of experiment with new things and so I went home and I like was trying on all this makeup and I thought wow this is like so much fun like finding new stuff and like figuring out like new ways to do things and like new products to use and I think that's kind of what like made me feel like I kind of want to start doing this like on regular basis like if I started working on people and like I knew that I was gonna I knew that I was gonna have to figure out like different ways to do things and I loved like learning I feel like that's what I love the most about makeup is because it's just it's never one thing it's always changing it's always like something new it's always planets always exciting and there's always so much to learn like I feel like I just never stopped learning in this industry like which is so cool and I think I think that's probably what started like what made me want to start doing people makeup on other people is just the fact that I wanted to like learn more about how to do stuff and I obviously love makeup I love applying it on people on myself I love doing videos and some like that I think I wanted to just find out you know how how I could better myself and how I could better the skill and the skills that you that I need to do makeup so I think that's probably why okay next question is how did you first get into freelancing what are some tips you've learned along the way regarding freelancing and being prepared for clients I feel like some tips that I've learned is to really plan ahead I feel like once I have like a wedding coming up I'm like that whole week I'm like okay do I have this do I have this I have this do I have this drive enough lashes do I have enough mascara do i havnt hope you know like you just always are trying to like go over everything in your head um but I definitely would say like being prepared and if you're not like an organized person like start trying to be organized because once you go out and you're freelancing and people are relying on you for something I was like big is like getting them ready for their wedding or getting them ready for prom we're getting ready for formal or whatever it may be it's like a lot of pressure and it can be pressure and when I first started I was always like Oh am i doing it right like am i okay like you know I was trying to like I haven't I always second-guessing myself but I think some tips I'm like I kind of mentioned earlier is to like save your money if you want to do freelancing it costs a lot of money as like a startup thing because you need so much product and you need so many like so many things of everything like you just need multiples it's like you're buying the stuff in bulk it's literally like I have I can't even tell you how many foundation tubes I have in these drawers like it's ridiculous but you just have to really be prepared with for like how much money you're gonna spend if this is something that you want to get into it's not cheap the more experience you get the more you can obviously like you can start charging people you can I and I wouldn't like I think when I first started I charge like oh my gosh like 35 or 40 dollars like and that was like the base like this is you know you can have me do whatever you want and like now obviously years later my prices have changed but you have to you have to be really realistic when you first start out in my opinion because you can't be like okay day one I'm gonna be a makeup artist today and I'm gonna charge $125 like you just doesn't work like that because people are not gonna like people are not gonna pay that but I think yeah those are probably my two biggest tips another tip that I really have is to take pictures of your work because I think that's how I mean that is how like I came to be like where I'm at now it's through Instagram and people you know some of my friends are always like why do you take in scams seriously like you're so dumb and I'm like um because that's my job it's literally my job that's how I make money and it's like through Instagram I'm not like literally through Instagram but because I post pictures of clients and like you know whatever I'm doing you know people really get to know you through social media they really get to see your work like firsthand so I think that's definitely like if you want to like take this thing seriously you want to be a freelance makeup artist I'd create a cat create an account create your own like personal Beauty account like I I wouldn't I don't know I have mixed feelings about like linking it to like your main account like if you're just like posting about I here no longer you know on a Tuesday like I think if people are gonna want to like see your work work like you should have something separate that's what I kind of did when I first started like I just had my makeup page I didn't have like another Instagram and now like I kind of like I kind of mix things every now and then but I have like my one for like here is my work makeup here is my work Instagram and then I have another one where it's like here's my Tuesday but definitely utilizing social media was so big and so important for me and really really helped me tremendously and getting my name out there and having other people see my work and having you know that's that's just how I built up I wouldn't say it clientele because it's not necessarily like I don't have too many repeat clients just because like you really don't get your makeup done for like a wedding like multiple times I mean maybe you do but like I mean think about if you're a bridal party like how many how many weddings are you really and you didn't mean like you just don't know like it's not like hair or you have to get it done like every three months I think it was kind of a little bit different but like I did get my name out there and people started knowing me more because of social media so I would definitely say to utilize social media as well okay just a few more questions here um I have a question about spray tans I really get them so I never know what's the best way to prep your skin for them what do you suggest okay so I get spray tans very regularly what I do is I make sure to exfoliate my skin too how do I say this the two days before I get my spray tan so like typically I get my spray tans on Thursday so I'll make sure to exfoliate my skin in the shower on Tuesday and on Wednesday night and then I usually just shave like the night before so I'll exploit my skin and everything on Tuesday and then I will exfoliate and shave also on Wednesday that's like the best way I got that's how it works for me isolating your skin and like obviously shaving is just gonna make everything go on smoother I'm not like a skincare expert so I really don't know like the technical terms for everything but I do know that exfoliant really helps this the tan to like stick to your skin better and I exfoliate too primarily because I have a tan on from like before like I already have a little bit of like tan like I can usually always see it like on my arms right here I don't know if like you can really see it but like you see that gets white right here and then it's like dark it's because that's like it's a tan so I tried like exploit my skin so that this that new tan will stay on and to also get rid of the old tan so that's what I suggest I mean the next question is what are your favorite nude lipsticks actually last question my favorite nude lipsticks let me grab them okay my my number one favorite nude lipstick is this one right here and this is from Tarte and I will show you up close what it looks like this is called rum punch and I feel like it looks so good on everybody and I just love lipsticks like that you know so this is what it looks like and I will swatch it for you okay so this is what rum punch looks like I think it's just like a really pretty pinky nude but like not too pink not too nude you know I'm saying like I just don't like lipsticks that are too pink and I don't like them to live six oh six lipsticks are too like browny nude I also love cream Cup from Mac this is more of like a very pinky nude can you even see that okay well yeah this is creme Cup I love to put like a lip liner like whirl or I don't even know which other ones that I have but I usually use whirl and then I will like align them with the world and then put cream Cup on top of it and then I also love anasazi a Beverly Hills pure Hollywood that's a really really good one alright so that is all the questions I hope you guys really enjoyed this Q&A video if you guys liked this kind of video let me know thank you guys so much for watching I hope you guys really enjoyed it and we'll see you next time bye you
