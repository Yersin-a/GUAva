hey what's up you guys it's again michaela and welcome and welcome back to my youtube channel so today i'm so excited to finally be filming a q a video you guys sent me in some bomb questions y'all came through with the questions in my community tab and i'm so so grateful for every single question i received please know that so i do not want to ramble for too much so grab yourself a snack got yourself some water some popcorn whatever and if you want to know more about me keep on watching so the very first question i received is where are you from and i am actually from california a lot of people don't know that about me but i'm from california and to be more specific i am from the bay area i was born and raised here my family's from here my dad is from sunset if you guys don't know where sunset is it's just a district in san francisco and my mom is from vallejo so the bay area is home for me the next question i received is how old are you and i am twenty years old next question is my most popular question i get online and in life in general and it's what is your ethnicity and my ethnicity is drum roll please it's literally not that serious i am a japanese german and filipino so i am white and asian that might come as a surprise to some people because a lot of people do think i am latina i mean it makes sense i did grow up in like a predominantly spanish-speaking neighborhood and i am a little bit of filipino to the point where some people like have called me like really rude terms because they think like i'm not asian if that makes sense so for example i was talking to a co-worker one time and i was telling her that like i wear a yokura when i walk around my house which is like a japanese house robe and she was like you're a culture appropriator you take japanese culture you're racist against asian people and i was like i'm japanese and she's like oh my god i'm so sorry that you're mexican and i was like oh okay but with that being said cause i literally talked about this question for so long um i am white and asian so the next question i received is do you have any siblings if so how many and are you the oldest or the youngest so i actually do have siblings i have four siblings and i have four brothers and they are all older than me so i am the youngest girl out of five somebody asked what is your zodiac sign and my son sign as a libra i resonate with my son sign so much but obviously i resonate with all of my big fives the next question is do you have any pets i do have one pet i have a dog she's a golden retriever and her name is maggie she's i think ten years old somebody asked me what is your favorite movie i have so many movies that i like thoroughly enjoy but if i'm gonna recommend one movie to you guys right now it's what happens on monday it's on netflix i saw it like two years ago and it will forever be imprinted in my brain love that movie but like my favorite movie of all time would have to be the last song with liam hemsworth and miley cyrus i just i'm a sucker for that movie so the next question i receive is what is your favorite type of food slash what is your favorite fast food my favorite type of food is definitely italian i feel like i was italian in my last life i love me a good penne vodka pasta italian food hands down my favorite fast food is chick-fil-a but honestly i don't even consider chick-fil-a fast food anymore because like that is a two-hour ordeal that is not no fast food like you gotta plan when you go to chick-fil-a um so actual like fast food fast food like i'm driving home it's 12 am i'm just trying to go home after work and like knock out but i need something in my system type food taco bell 100 love me a good nacho fry with a baja blast freeze the next question is what is your favorite musical artist slash what music do you listen to when you get ready i think some of you guys know this by now but i am a rap listener i like rap music um i think it's just the culture that i grew up in everyone around me has always listened to rap music so that's kind of the music that i listen to when i get ready but as for like who is my favorite musical artist of all time it's actually ariana grande if i could listen to like one artist for forever it would be her music i love how versatile it is and i just think she's so bomb and so talented so she's my favorite musical artist but my favorite music to listen to when i get ready is hands down rap music so the next question is are you a student if so what are you studying um i am a student and my major might surprise some of you guys i am a double major in media broadcasting and theater actually so with my majors obviously you guys can tell that i love to be in front of the camera i love to talk to people so i'd love to be either a news anchor or a sports news anchor or even just like celebrity news anchor like i'd love to be any type of broadcasting position i love being in front of the camera and i think it's so obvious to you guys that i love like doing what i'm doing the theater major requires you to take a lot of on-camera classes and it works perfectly with my journalism major when i'm a broadcaster because i know how to present myself in front of a camera so i love my theater major if you guys have ever like wanted to work on your public speaking or ever wanted a job where you're going to speak in front of large groups i definitely recommend that you look at minoring in theater like it is a great addition and it's super super underrated i feel like when people think of public speaking majors they their minds first goes to communications um but definitely check out theater i did major in communications i do have my aaa in communications and it was okay but i did prefer my aaa and theater it was like so much more fun but it actually works out perfectly because in both positions i get to work in front of the camera and learn how to speak to a bigger audience and that's ultimately what my dream job is and i actually got a question what is your dream job and like i said my dream job is to be some type of news anchor broadcaster i'd love to do that but also one of my like secret dream careers is that i really want to be a working actress i would love to book just some major role with somebody so the next question i received is do you have a job outside of youtube and i do have a job um i work at a movie theater which goes perfectly with my like being in front of the camera wanting to major in journalism wanting to be an actress type thing next question is do you drink coffee if so what is your order i do drink coffee i drink coffee every single morning i make myself a toffeena iced coffee and then i pour hazelnut creamer and caramel drizzle in it and it's a fire i usually don't get coffee when i go out just because i like the coffee that i make at home i'm very like precise about my coffee um but if i do order coffee at starbucks i'll get an iced coffee with heavy cream and four pumps of white chocolate mocha so the next question is have you ever played any sports how were the coaches and i played literally every single sport that you can think of growing up like if you can think of a sport i played it like even football like i played the flag version but literally i played every single sport and i've always had really awesome coaches i've never had like these super scary ones if i had to think my basketball coach was probably my scariest coach but like even so he was pretty nice but the last sport ever played was varsity swim i was on the swim team when i was in high school um and that was it that was like the very last sport i played next question i received is do you like to be called kayla or michaela and it's so funny that you guys asked me this is because i feel like if you have been here since i had like 200 subscribers you would know that my name on youtube used to be michaela wegner which is my full name um but i did switch it to kayla and the reason why i switched it to kayla was actually because somebody took the liberty to go in my comment section and leak my address for some reason they like put my zip code but my whole address put my area code and everything the town i grew up in like they was putting all my information in the comment section and i was like for what so i had to switch my name on youtube from my full name to jess kayla i know some people met me as michaela so they prefer to call me michaela but some people met me as kayla so that's what they call me i honestly do not have a preference but that is the only reason why if you guys are wondering like why i switched my name or what should you call me that's the reason why i switched it but honestly like call me whatever like you feel comfortable doing so what is your biggest pet peeve and honestly i feel like i have so many pet peeves but obviously because i'm recording i just blank out on it but the first one that comes in my mind when i think of my pet peeves is when people purposefully like wear their mask underneath their nose like it's one thing if it like slips down like that's okay y'all like like it happens but when people purposely like place it underneath their nose i feel like they're like flashing me i'm like pull it up a little bit pull it up so um that's one of my pet peeves but i'm sure i have a lot more pet peeves that i just like am blanking on right now what do you like to do in your down time and honestly if i have like complete downtime like no homework no work no nothing um i just like to sit down and watch youtube videos i am like a little hermit like that i can honestly like my screen time y'all is kind of ridiculous like i will sit down and watch youtube videos for eight hours straight and literally have no problem doing that i genuinely like to watch other people's videos so that is a big thing i like to do so i got the question of do you have a boyfriend if so how long have you guys been dating i actually do not have a boyfriend right now i'm chilling just because i am going to probably move soon in the next couple months it's not set in stone but i am in the process of trying to move so i do not want to get into a committed relationship right before i move so i'm okay right now the next question i received is do you want children and i actually do want children if i could have it my way um i would want to be like my parents and have five kids four boys and one girl but honestly my main goal is just to have at least four kids like minimum four kids so the next question i received is what is your biggest dream so i did confide in you guys already i did tell you guys but my biggest dream of all time is to work with netflix i literally don't know how i'm going to do it but i'm going to find a way i do i want to work with netflix like that's my dream the next question i received is would you ever start a brand and a hundred percent i don't even think i mentioned that for one of my biggest goals but one of my biggest goals as well is to start my own brands i don't know what it would be i don't know it would be perfume or makeup or clothing or like a stationery if you guys don't know that about me i love pens or if i would write my own book but i want something to my name so i would love to make my own brand one day so i just have to think of ideas and work my way there somebody said what do you want people to know about your personality and something i would love for you guys to know is that i am a very very driven person um i am somebody that's constantly wanting to create and do new things i think we all have that one person in our life where they talk to you and it's like every single time they talk to you they're doing something new and it's so funny because i feel like i have like people in my life that kind of evil eye me like i have like family members or friends and when i tell them i want to start a new project they're kind of like oh like why don't you finish the last one you started but that's just never me i'm constantly on the move and i'm constantly wanting to grow and i am just like i have big dreams and big goals and i plan on attaining every single one of them so if i could let you guys know anything about my personality is that like baby i dream big and i i go for it so everything i want in life i genuinely go out there and i put my effort in to achieve so that is something i would love for you guys to know about me so now we're gonna go more into like the youtube based questions because i received a lot of those but i was saving those towards the end just because i wanted you guys to get to know me on a more personal level first a whole bunch of people ask me what made you start your youtube channel so i think it is very apparent that i do love talking in front of the camera but that is actually not the reason why i started my youtube channel i started my youtube channel genuinely because i love talking to other people not just talking to a camera so i started my youtube channel to talk to the camera but i continued going and continue to make videos because of the comments that you guys leave to me i don't think you guys realize that when you guys leave me a comment that makes my entire day way that you guys can tell me about how your day's going and tell me what products you're into and telling me like you know just anything about yourself makes me so so happy and that's really why i started my youtube channel was just to get to know other people and to make friends and just to you know grow in who i know in this world and i think that's so beautiful about youtube is that how i have friends literally in the philippines right now i have friends in new jersey right now i have friends all over the world you guys tell me you're from the uk or india and it just makes me so happy and that's why i started my youtube channel was just to talk to people like you guys the next question i received is how long have you been monetized slash how long have you been doing youtube so i have been monetized i think since like february like 15th or 16th some some day like that um somewhere in mid february um and how long have you been doing youtube it honestly depends what you consider um because i used to make like i think in like 2017 i made one video i think in 2018 i made one video i think in 2019 i make two videos like you know what i'm saying like it depends what you really consider when did i start consistently making videos was in december so december of 2020 is when i consistently started making videos the next question is how do you deal with hate and i don't know if you guys know this but i actually do receive a lot of hate which was funny but not funny because i didn't think i would get hate until i became like a bigger channel i do could still consider myself a small youtuber and i never thought i would receive hate like at the amounts that i did but one thing that i always remind myself and it's funny because jasmine said this in her video and i it's so when she said that my jaw dropped because i literally tell my friends that same exact thing all the time and it's that people that like send me hate online would never have the audacity to say that stuff to my face like you literally would not be able to walk up to me and talk to me the way that you do and it's just funny how like behind the screen people just get this wave of confidence to be rude to other people and it's like okay but would you say that to my face though so that's something that i remind myself is that like you know people are this way just because it's the internet but one of the biggest things i do to help myself with hate is genuinely look at the nice comments for every hate comment i receive i receive like twenty nice comments and that genuinely keeps me going that's the main thing i do if i ever receive a hate comment i will just go and i'll find a positive comment and i'll read it i'll remind myself that there are really really awesome people out there in this world and you just gotta choose to acknowledge them over the shitty people next question is what is your all-time favorite scent bear vanilla by victoria's secret of course somebody said what supplements do you take slash recommends i unfortunately cannot recommend you guys any supplements since i'm not your guys doctors but i will let you guys know what supplements i do take personally i take b12 for energy because i don't really eat meat like that so i do take b12 i take a cranberry like gummy i don't take the pills i take the gummies um i take a woman's multivitamin and that's basically it i don't really take a lot of like vitamins or supplements um but yeah i do use protein powder in my smoothies but like that's just protein powder somebody asked how long did it take you to perfect your routine it's still going my routine is not perfect literally i promise you guys there are things where i every single day i learn something new about my body and i learn what works and what doesn't work for me so i'm still working on it i'm 20 years old we still we still thriving like it is a journey self-care is a journey somebody said must have skin care products i will be making a skincare routine but i promise you guys my skincare routine is super simple like i do not do too much um favorite vanilla scents i'm gonna make a whole video talking just about my favorite gourmand scents i'm just trying to get all my products together um but at the moment um i've been loving the eos vanilla cashmere lotion bomb um i love the ogx shea body wash bomb and then of course bear vanilla like come on y'all know me y'all know i love me bear vanilla but i will be making a whole video talking about my favorite vanilla scents don't worry i got you boo so the next question is what got you into fragrances so i've always been into hygiene i've been watching haichi and youtube since i was in like sixth grade like that's how long i've been watching the hygiene side of youtube it was a very small community but like it was still there um so i've always been into the hygiene side but i didn't get into fragrances until december so i started watching tick tock and there was a like hygiene like shower tick talk and on shower tik tok everyone was obsessed with a thousand wishes and into the night from bath and body works and i didn't know what those were so i was like okay so i just went onto the bath and bodyworks website and they happened to have a 595 body care day the day that i searched it and i was like oh okay everything's on sale i'll just buy like a whole bunch of crap so like i just bought a whole bunch of stuff and my package came in and i was like you know what i haven't made a youtube video in a cool minute i'm gonna record this so i recorded it and it literally changed my life you guys like loved that video and i met so many awesome people through that video so i'm so blessed and so grateful that you know i was able to make that video and then once i made that video you guys started like sending in recommendations and asking me to try out certain scents and that's how i really got into fragrances so if you guys did not know i didn't get into fragrances until around january of this year so the last question that i received is one that i specifically saved for last and it is how are you and i thought this was a great question just to end off on so thank you guys so much a lot of you guys asked me how i was so thank you right now your girl is a little stressed it is that time of the school year where teachers are just really cracking down on their assignments so i have a whole bunch of assignments i have work as you guys know like i said earlier i do work full time so i work like four days a week and i also go to school four days a week and now i have my beautiful youtube channel so i am a little stressed trying to balance everything out with that being said i am so abundantly blessed and grateful and i like to view all the things that i see as stress in my life as good stress so like instead of viewing it like oh like i have school work to do i'm always like oh well at least i'm getting my education like i always try to flip things on me and remind myself that the things i stress about are good stressors and they're healthy for me and they just help to boost me to where i want to be eventually in life but with that being said i am going to end off today's video if you watch the end please comment down below because i don't know who would watch to the end of this video but if you did just know i love you you're my you're my fave so i am going to talk to you guys very very soon i love
