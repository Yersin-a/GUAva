video on my channel that i've been have made for like what two years now well the wait is over and i'm gonna be dropping videos we gonna find a program but i'm let y'all know i'm here and i'm here to stay and we gonna go what and we're gonna go head first with this okay i can promise y'all there's gonna be so much more to come so much girl talks so many vlogs so many get ready with me so many hauls just a whole bunch of stuff anything y'all want to see i'm down to record and post for y'all this video is going to be a q a get to know me i'm answering the questions that i normally probably wouldn't answer on live or in the dms or in the comments section so this is your guys's opportunity to really get the team to get into it to get to know joe and i outside of blazing so here i have 31 questions that you guys asked me out of like hundreds of questions but i just feel like these are the ones that will help y'all get to know me the best and maybe in the next video i'll answer like the other questions that has to do with like my personal life and my relationship life but this one i just wanted to give y'all an opportunity to know jonah and not malaysian let's get into this video right now so the first question is how old are you what's your sign and when is your birthday so i just turned twenty-two years old my birthday is september 15 1998 and i am a virgo no cocky [ __ ] i feel like burgers is the best sign like if i wasn't even a virgo i would still say virgos is the best sign because what like beyonce's a virgo queen of b is a virgo okay question number two are you still in school and what school do you go to i am currently enrolled as a senior at ucla this is my last year thank god um yeah so i'm still in school i'm doing it online because of rona but i just want to walk the stage honestly i don't care where i'm doing school from just as long as i get to walk that stage in june and do my little this little cross stitch i'm good question number three any advice for high schoolers or college advice um let me think back to when i was in high school because that was a really long time ago i graduated in 2016 but i personally did not take high school serious at all um freshman year i had straight a's i was like real good kids sophomore and junior definitely worked hard and they kept my butt senior year i picked up the slack and my grades was good just like freshman year but i feel like colleges really look at your sophomore and junior year grades not so much your freshman or your senior year um and that's where like i got that and so with the grades that i had in my overall gpa i just knew i wasn't going to be able to go to like berkeley or ucla all the top schools that i would hope to have went to so i chose the route of going to a junior college for two years i went to de anza community college i play basketball for them too but i went to danza community college for two years and then i reapplied to colleges after the two years and i ended up getting into ucla high school advice i would definitely say take your grades seriously like if you don't want to go to a jc for two years and you want to go straight out of high school take high school seriously but also make time for your social life so you have to find a balance between your social life and your school life um me i was more of just like social life so i was an athlete i was just you know wanted to play ball and all that but i went to an all asian school so it was a lot of pressure on the students that went there because not stereotyping not trying to be racist or nothing but asians are known to take schooling more serious you know so i would definitely say do work hard but find a balance again between schoolwork and your social life because you have to have both there you can't just have a school life and no social life whereas you're gonna go crazy advice for college college my first two years of community college was so fun because i don't know when i went to college i was expecting it to be a heavy workload i'm gonna be stressed out it's gonna be so many classes so much going on because i was playing basketball too so i was like there's no way i'm gonna be able to juggle this but i did really well my first two years of college while i was still playing ball um i made so many new friends like all the athletes were in the same class so y'all can imagine just a whole classroom full of football players basketball players baseball players soccer players like it was lit okay but that was good because you're surrounded by people who know what you're going through what you're experiencing having a juggle okay i got a game this day but i got a midterm and final this day too like you know we were all like in cahoots with each other like supporting each other through the whole class and that was really good advice for college so when i got to ucla i really didn't make friends like i was making at a jc like it was a whole different ballgame for me a new environment i'm originally from the bay area so i moved down to southern california la to go to school and i knew nobody there i knew one girl that's from vallejo california which is like 30 minutes from me um and she was going to you see she got into ucla as well and that was like the only person i was kind of hanging out with we had so many classes together like that destiny if you ever watch this shout out to you because girl you helped me a lot but that was the only person that i really know uh when we would go to parties i'd just go with destiny and her friends like i never made friends outside of destiny except for one and her name was cheyenne cheyenne if you ever watch this i miss you and i love you we fell off on some like weak [ __ ] but girl come and those two people really helped me my daily routine considered me like going to class coming back to my dorm studying i would step out every now and then to like do laundry or go grab something from the cafe but most of the time like i was door dashing through my jar my parents were paying thousands of dollars for like the food slash meal program and i was not utilizing it i had so many swipes left like when i left ucla and came back home because of corona i had so many swipes left it was bad oh and another tip or not tip but college advice save your money while you are in school that is so important like i wouldn't say i depended on my parents a lot while i was in school because i was still making my own money but it's really important to save save save that money like if you have parents that are going to support you and pay for your schooling and your books and all that be appreciated because i know a lot of people whose parents are more so like oh no like you're making money you go pay for your books and college books is like 200 of 150 a book so save your money if you can question number four how did i get into ucla i kind of talked about this already but i got into ucla after doing two years at a community college in my city um i had really good grades i worked really really hard um utilize your college counselors my counselor louise she helped me so much like i didn't know how to apply for colleges i'm thinking i'm gonna have to write so many essays so many you know about means and why i should get accepted and it's not i didn't have to do none of that it was simply just like filling out paperwork boo boom but touching your parents income you know whatever it is boop send it off and she really really helped me because i ended up being um i ended up being behind on some credits which caused me to stay like an extra two quarters at the answer so i ended up really being there for three years two and a half three years taking the last quarter off then transferring that following square so she helped me get back on track you know i changed my major i think what two times originally no three times originally i was a um kinesiology major then i switched to a psychology major then i finally went to sociology and i really love it um so yeah utilize your college counselors they really help what's my dream career i originally wanted to be a lawyer have my own law firm law firm i originally wanted to study criminal law or business law because that's really this is always where the money is criminal law i say that because i like to watch first 48 csi beyond scare strength all of that like i could really sit there and watch it all day so i've been going back and forth between those two divisions of law but now being who i am with this big following on social media i want to see where i can go with instagram whether that be modeling or working with bigger businesses or boutiques or even youtube you know it's no telling where i go with this youtube stuff if i really keep adding like i plan to okay we're not going to be slaving getting that bag we finna get that bag doing what we love to do and i love taking pictures for you i love talking to y'all so do i want kids if so how many yes i want kids i want five kids i want more boys than girls um i just love boy i didn't just could see myself as a boy mom it was weird because before like i got older i always said no i want girls like you know everybody's like i don't know i want girls i want to be able to do her hair no because i know how i am and having more than one me is going to stress me out i want to be a boy mom but of course i want like one or two daughters question number seven do you speak any other languages other than english yes i speak mandarin mandarin was actually my first language my mom is from taiwan my dad is from chicago growing up i didn't learn english until i started grade school so here i am this little mixed baby didn't know in liquor english and was just speaking mandarin i was often the translator between like because my great-grandma raised me and she didn't know english so the only way for me to talk to her was to speak mandarin so i didn't start learning english until i started maybe kindergarten first grade question number eight what is your nationality like i said my mom is from taiwan my dad is from chicago i am therefore chinese and black hence blasian you know the only one don't play with her she's not one of them number nine what do you look for in a boyfriend this is like hard because if y'all look at my track record with the dudes that i have dated y'all are gonna be like there's no way like this like but no like i like a gentleman i like somebody who asked me about my dad who's not just oh for themselves i like somebody who's selfless who who acts as my protector who genuinely loves me for me not just trying to be around because of who i am or what i have to offer or what i got or what i could get for them or the position i could put them in i just want somebody who loves me for joe and i and not blazing to say the least i could go on and on forever about this but we're just gonna keep it short and sweet what's your favorite color my favorite color is pink not the hot pink not the bright pink the baby soft pink like the very light blush pink question eleven what is your favorite designer brand i am a designer junkie like i love expensive stuff um i love gucci i really am so in love with chanel i like prada um versace is cool davinci is cool um i'm trying to think offlight is cool but i think my favorite brand really is chanel like them sneakers yeah what question twelve how do you save money this is hard because i spend so much money like it's done but what i used to do is before i started getting that big bag what i used to do was when i would get paid i would put half of my check in my savings and then like half of my check it was to spend so it might not be half it might be majority of my check went to my savings and i would keep like 100 or hundred dollars for me to spend and i did that every paycheck and i wasn't really spending then so like if you have two hundred dollars and say your checkings and then your next check you put it under two hundred dollars it starts stacking nothing sorry is so money so you got some money in your checkings but you also got some money in your savings you got to do it like that and if you can't buy something let's say five times over don't buy it once and this doesn't go for like your dream house or a car that you want or whatever this goes for like the materialistic designer things the the non-essential things question number thirteen where are you from i kind of answered this already but i am from the bay area california yeah that way question number fourteen what is your real name my real name is jonai j-o-n-a-i a lot of people pronounce it like joe nae or joanie no joe nye question number fifteen how do you keep your skin looking so clear and glowing um i every morning i wake up and i wash my face with hot water first then i grab like my sarah v survey however you want to say it it's like the green bottle green and white bottle facial cleanser rub it put it on my face rub it rub rub it rinse it off and wipe it with a face towel then i take like i have some face oil serum and i just put a few droplets on my face and i just rub it in and that's really it um other than that i eat a lot of fruits i like i eat a lot of fruits i drink a lot of water when when you make healthier life decisions and life choices you start to look better you glow better you glow different this that [ __ ] glow period very very inferior okay yeah don't play question number sixteen how did i gain followers um so it's a long story but i'm gonna cut it short for y'all so i was basically in a relationship for five years with my first boyfriend ever when we broke up i literally started just taking pictures on instagram and i started blowing up like 40k 50k and then y'all might know i talked to a rapper by the name of nba young boy for a little minute for for a while actually it's just i had to keep it on the low low because i don't do all that media stuff but i talked to the rapper and be a young boy and from there it just like boom like took off question number 17 how did i meet nelly i met bryson on instagram before he really was in le like he was in italy but he wasn't nowhere like how he is now question number eighteen how tall am i i am for my real short question number nineteen what are your goals in life i kind of answered this already but i want to get married i want to have a family i want to have my own business i just want to be rich like rich in health and rich in wealth just overall rich i want just so many things for myself for my family for those around me who love me genuinely and i just want i just want to be happy doing what i love to do question number twenty relationship status you're in my business yeah don't do that i am currently talking to somebody y'all might know y'all might not um but he goes by the name of double r gmk he is from florida y'all might have seen us on the shade room or whatever it is but that is my birthday question number twenty-one was who is the new man in your life i just answered that with the other question question number twenty-two how did you meet jmk so it's weird how god works because i'm not even going to say his real name because then he's going to be so upset with me but i he see me like a while ago before i was really big how i am now on instagram but at that time he was in a relationship i think at that time i was too um but he was like i've been pichu like i've been told my bros like she is so fun like i want her this isn't that and it was like one day i was on the explorer page or somebody i follow i guess had reposted a picture of him and g9 and i had sent it to my friend me and i was like girl like he is so cute like you know not even knowing that she knew him or went to high school with him but i had dmd her the picture i'm like girl he's so cute she was like oh that's whoopi whoa like i went to high school with him i'm like shut up she was like no you want me to dm him for you and me being who i am i was like yeah i'm not gonna dm him like i'm not gonna get left on scene or i'm not even gonna give somebody an opportunity to be like oh y'all i guess we'll dm me like look what but no so she dm'd him and long story short he dm me like what's up and i just went from there question number 23 are you pregnant really [ __ ] no i'm not no i'm not question number twenty-four what's your major how many degrees will you have would you graduate um my major i am a sociology major and i will have two degrees when i graduate in the spring um i will have my associate's degree and a bachelor's degree in sociology twenty-five long-term and short-term goals i kind of already answered that so i'm not even going to say it again 26 how many tattoos do you have a most painful tattoo in piercing so i have one two three four five six six tattoos my most painful tattoo was my back i thought like my bones were breaking it hurt so bad piercings i have about twenty-four and majority of them are in my ears i don't know if y'all can see but they're in my ears and then here my belly my lip right there my most painful piercing was definitely my my nipples my nipples hurt so bad like it felt like somebody chewed my nipple off question number 27 what is next for me i'm dropping my clothing line my sweat suit brand t-shirts all of that i have dropped like some sneak peeks on my instagram if you haven't seen them go check them out they're in my highlights under ceo but those are coming like end of this month soon like real soon um again this youtube that i just started that's next for me as well and i have a lash business that i just launched um underscore blatant wigs on instagram go cut you some lashes these are from my lash line in the style hot girl but yeah it's a lot of things coming from me from me fourth quarter gotta finish this year strong 2021 is definitely gonna be my year i'm going up and that's just day question number 28 how do you feel about the hate that you receive regarding your love life i honestly do not care because at the end of the day i'm probably not going to meet half of y'all let alone a handful of y'all so i don't let what other people say affect me and how i feel about myself or how i view myself and those who truly know me and love me and are around me on a daily basis on a daily basis don't care what somebody who doesn't know me has to say like they know the real me y'all don't know the real me y'all only know what is out there on the media y'all don't know the real story behind all the tea that you see or any of this so i don't really let the hay get to me i don't read comments on instagram i simply go on there post my pictures work and get off like i don't sit up there and scroll through the shade room or scroll through my post looking at people talking about oh this is you you're a weird like what you can't tell me i'm ugly because i know i'm not ugly and your boyfriend doesn't think i'm ugly either so stop the cat no kizzy but in all seriousness serious mess i don't let any of that faze me i don't let it bother me because at the end of the day it doesn't stop a bag over here like me and mine we straight worry about you and yours sleeping on that air mattress with roaches in your house question 29 what is your favorite thing about yourself i think my favorite thing about myself is i have multiple things my personality one i'm just super outgoing i'm funny i'm chill like i don't really take nothing serious i don't really let anything bother me and then i would have to say like the tough skin that i have developed over time i've never always i've never always had tough skin like i do now but being placed in the position that i am in today that god has placed me in it has taught me to brush things off to not listen to the haters to not let somebody's opinion or how they feel about me affect me because at the end of the day one monkey don't stop the show the show must go on perry question number 30 how did you get famous i kind of already answered this already but we're not going to go into too much detail on that just now like and question number 31 what do i do for fun i like to go shopping i like to travel i'm traveling a lot all the time whether it be do you stand and stay at chloe's house or my hearing me or you know whatever and i'm so blessed to be able to get up and go when i want to go um a lot of people aren't fortunate fortunate enough to
