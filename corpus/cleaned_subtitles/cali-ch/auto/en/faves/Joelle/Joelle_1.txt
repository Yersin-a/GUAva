Jo	Joelle	4.04	6.029	what's up you guys it's Joelle and
Jo	Joelle	6.029	7.589	welcome back to my channel
Jo	Joelle	7.589	10.29	today I'm starting a new series on my
Jo	Joelle	10.29	12.09	channel that I want to start for quite a
Jo	Joelle	12.09	13.98	while I'm going to be calling it the
Jo	Joelle	13.98	16.23	best life and this was inspired by Amy
Jo	Joelle	16.23	18.359	vagabonds the am with Amy where it's
Jo	Joelle	18.359	20.1	basically like a get ready with me kind
Jo	Joelle	20.1	22.23	of situation but she also just talks he
Jo	Joelle	22.23	23.789	talks about things that she's interested
Jo	Joelle	23.789	25.439	in and stuff that she's been thinking
Jo	Joelle	25.439	28.019	about lately and can address topics that
Jo	Joelle	28.019	30.15	you guys requested and stuff like that
Jo	Joelle	30.15	31.5	so I wanted a format where I could
Jo	Joelle	31.5	33.6	combine my love for beauty and makeup
Jo	Joelle	33.6	36.329	and all of that with just the deeper
Jo	Joelle	36.329	37.649	things because for all of you makeup
Jo	Joelle	37.649	39.03	lovers I know that there is a lot of
Jo	Joelle	39.03	41.43	multidimensionality behind what goes on
Jo	Joelle	41.43	43.8	on your face so I just wanted to provide
Jo	Joelle	43.8	45.51	a space for that here on YouTube since I
Jo	Joelle	45.51	47.879	feel like a lot of times you know beauty
Jo	Joelle	47.879	49.379	gurus can kind of get relegated to only
Jo	Joelle	49.379	51.449	doing you know beauty cuz of course
Jo	Joelle	51.449	52.559	that's what they're good at but I
Jo	Joelle	52.559	55.32	personally love hearing about what
Jo	Joelle	55.32	57.12	people are thinking about and just
Jo	Joelle	57.12	58.35	what's going on between their ears
Jo	Joelle	58.35	60.69	behind all of the stuff that is just
Jo	Joelle	60.69	62.64	seen on camera the turtle of this series
Jo	Joelle	62.64	65.729	the best life is inspired by a verse out
Jo	Joelle	65.729	68.28	of proverbs three that I love it's how
Jo	Joelle	68.28	70.68	verses three to flourish and from the
Jo	Joelle	70.68	72.6	passion translation it reads let your
Jo	Joelle	72.6	74.31	life be shaped by integrity with truth
Jo	Joelle	74.31	75.869	written upon your heart that's how
Jo	Joelle	75.869	77.58	you'll find favor and understanding us
Jo	Joelle	77.58	79.229	both God and men and you will gain the
Jo	Joelle	79.229	81.229	reputation of living life well and
Jo	Joelle	81.229	83.61	personally that is something that I
Jo	Joelle	83.61	86.13	would love is to be known for living
Jo	Joelle	86.13	88.89	life well and so a lot of the topics
Jo	Joelle	88.89	90.42	that I'm going to be discussing in this
Jo	Joelle	90.42	92.43	series are just you know the everyday
Jo	Joelle	92.43	94.71	topics of being a human on this planet
Jo	Joelle	94.71	96.84	and figuring out how to live our best
Jo	Joelle	96.84	99.39	lives so for my first episode I decided
Jo	Joelle	99.39	101.939	to really pay tribute to Amy and do her
Jo	Joelle	101.939	104.159	Asian American tag which she started
Jo	Joelle	104.159	106.979	this past spring I want to say as so I'm
Jo	Joelle	106.979	108.75	gonna be answering her questions as they
Jo	Joelle	108.75	110.28	get ready and I'll have people tagged
Jo	Joelle	110.28	112.38	down below but if you make youtube
Jo	Joelle	112.38	113.97	videos and are interested in doing this

Jo	Joelle	116.07	117.6	the questions as well starting with my
Jo	Joelle	117.6	119.04	face I actually already put on sunscreen

Jo	Joelle	124.85	127.909	shadow base to get started and her first
Jo	Joelle	127.909	130.759	question is what ethnicity are you and I
Jo	Joelle	130.759	134.03	am Chinese Korean American my mom is
Jo	Joelle	134.03	136.88	Chinese my dad is Korean for eyeshadow
Jo	Joelle	136.88	139.67	I'm getting into my Too Faced just
Jo	Joelle	139.67	141.59	peachy mattes palette that my sister
Jo	Joelle	141.59	144.05	mica got me thank you very much mica and
Jo	Joelle	144.05	145.16	this is gonna be your just a really
Jo	Joelle	145.16	147.98	summery everyday peachy look so I'm
Jo	Joelle	147.98	150.05	using peach tea I'm gonna use that all
Jo	Joelle	150.05	151.94	over my lid and the next question is
Jo	Joelle	151.94	153.95	what generation are you and I am
Jo	Joelle	153.95	157.01	technically second-generation my dad
Jo	Joelle	157.01	159.38	moved to the States from Seoul Korea
Jo	Joelle	159.38	163.61	when he was six but since he grew up in
Jo	Joelle	163.61	164.269	the States
Jo	Joelle	164.269	165.95	he's considered like first generation
Jo	Joelle	165.95	169.28	American I believe I don't Christ me on
Jo	Joelle	169.28	170.69	that if I'm wrong and my mom is also
Jo	Joelle	170.69	172.88	first generation because she was born in
Jo	Joelle	172.88	176.39	the States because her parents moved
Jo	Joelle	176.39	179.09	here from China when they were around
Jo	Joelle	179.09	181.64	college-aged next I'm gonna get into
Jo	Joelle	181.64	184.43	peach punch and I'm gonna put this on
Jo	Joelle	184.43	186.38	the outer half of my lids okay question
Jo	Joelle	186.38	188.42	number three is what is the first
Jo	Joelle	188.42	189.5	experience where you felt the
Jo	Joelle	189.5	191.209	demarcation of being a minority or
Jo	Joelle	191.209	195.26	different and I would say I knew all
Jo	Joelle	195.26	198.019	along that I was considered a minority
Jo	Joelle	198.019	200.51	because my parents would mention it when
Jo	Joelle	200.51	202.13	they talked about why we settled down in
Jo	Joelle	202.13	204.26	San Francisco is that my mom wanted us
Jo	Joelle	204.26	205.88	to grow up in a place where we wouldn't
Jo	Joelle	205.88	207.65	really have to experience as much racism
Jo	Joelle	207.65	209.18	growing up I think I really felt it
Jo	Joelle	209.18	211.04	regarding to my like specifically
Jo	Joelle	211.04	214.04	regarding to my race in high school I
Jo	Joelle	214.04	216.23	went to the same elementary school from
Jo	Joelle	216.23	218.03	like second grade to eighth grade but
Jo	Joelle	218.03	219.5	when I went to high school I was when I
Jo	Joelle	219.5	220.76	was you know kind of cognizant enough
Jo	Joelle	220.76	222.29	and I was gonna be around new people
Jo	Joelle	222.29	224.78	and my sister had already begun at that
Jo	Joelle	224.78	226.73	high school and she was telling you
Jo	Joelle	226.73	228.079	about like the social groups and how
Jo	Joelle	228.079	230.239	there was like how people would self
Jo	Joelle	230.239	232.579	separate segregate and there is like a
Jo	Joelle	232.579	234.95	group of the cool cool Asians and then
Jo	Joelle	234.95	237.079	the nerdy Asians literally like Mean
Jo	Joelle	237.079	239.48	Girls and I was like well how do I get
Jo	Joelle	239.48	242.03	to be with like the cool Asians like
Jo	Joelle	242.03	243.2	what's the difference between being a
Jo	Joelle	243.2	245.06	cool Asian a nerdy Asian like I don't
Jo	Joelle	245.06	246.859	really know what that means and she's
Jo	Joelle	246.859	248.84	like well like the nerdy is like kind of
Jo	Joelle	248.84	251.84	quiet they're like pretty book smart and
Jo	Joelle	251.84	254.51	just keep to themselves and with that I
Jo	Joelle	254.51	255.09	did
Jo	Joelle	255.09	256.98	super self-conscious as I began to say
Jo	Joelle	256.98	258.989	that high school because I was like oh
Jo	Joelle	258.989	260.489	no people are just gonna take one look
Jo	Joelle	260.489	262.049	at me and IRA me like she's a nerdy
Jo	Joelle	262.049	264.6	Asian cuz I was a nerdy I was very nerdy
Jo	Joelle	264.6	266.669	in middle school and I just felt like
Jo	Joelle	266.669	268.59	people are going to pinpoint me from the
Jo	Joelle	268.59	270.78	very beginning as being super quiet and
Jo	Joelle	270.78	273.33	never give me the chance to become one
Jo	Joelle	273.33	275.4	of their friends I choose this moment
Jo	Joelle	275.4	276.96	rather than you know that moment in
Jo	Joelle	276.96	278.28	middle school when someone makes fun of
Jo	Joelle	278.28	280.83	my lunch or something because I honestly
Jo	Joelle	280.83	282.449	don't think I really put it together
Jo	Joelle	282.449	285.12	that it was because my food was
Jo	Joelle	285.12	286.919	different or like I was minority than
Jo	Joelle	286.919	288.96	they were laughing I was just like well
Jo	Joelle	288.96	290.61	that's weird you don't like good food
Jo	Joelle	290.61	293.58	but like whatever but I think it's
Jo	Joelle	293.58	295.71	because I was so lucky to grow up in
Jo	Joelle	295.71	298.35	such a diverse place was that I was with
Jo	Joelle	298.35	300.12	a lot like I literally went to middle
Jo	Joelle	300.12	302.01	school in downtown Chinatown of San
Jo	Joelle	302.01	304.77	Francisco so like sure people could be
Jo	Joelle	304.77	307.2	rude and be like oh my gosh Oh like what
Jo	Joelle	307.2	309.66	is that it was literally mon Dieu or pot
Jo	Joelle	309.66	311.43	stickers you can buy them at Costco like
Jo	Joelle	311.43	314.699	come on I literally saw as their problem
Jo	Joelle	314.699	316.74	not mine and I was like okay I'm sorry
Jo	Joelle	316.74	319.11	like I'll try to make it smell less but
Jo	Joelle	319.11	321.87	I'm still gonna eat it cuz like you live
Jo	Joelle	321.87	323.88	in San Francisco how can you like how
Jo	Joelle	323.88	325.71	can you be like this oh yeah I mean just
Jo	Joelle	325.71	326.85	to follow up with like the high school
Jo	Joelle	326.85	329.01	thing thankfully after I got to high
Jo	Joelle	329.01	331.08	school I was like super extra brewed I
Jo	Joelle	331.08	334.2	was like the most talkative like funny
Jo	Joelle	334.2	336.66	silly bubbly person I tried I could
Jo	Joelle	336.66	338.58	possibly D so that people win it
Jo	Joelle	338.58	340.5	immediately pinpoint me as like a quiet
Jo	Joelle	340.5	343.349	Asian and like in a weird sad way to be
Jo	Joelle	343.349	344.94	honest it worked like people likes me
Jo	Joelle	344.94	346.979	they didn't see me and like delegate me
Jo	Joelle	346.979	348.389	to the group of like quiet Asian girls
Jo	Joelle	348.389	350.7	but I realized later on that I was like
Jo	Joelle	350.7	352.53	why I being like this like it I of
Jo	Joelle	352.53	354.12	course like I wanted to be close with
Jo	Joelle	354.12	356.82	everyone and I wanted to be friendly but
Jo	Joelle	356.82	358.56	I realized was coming out of a place of
Jo	Joelle	358.56	362.039	insecurity of being you know stereotyped
Jo	Joelle	362.039	364.2	incorrectly rather than just being my
Jo	Joelle	364.2	366.09	like true authentic self and then
Jo	Joelle	366.09	368.07	throughout the rest of high school from
Jo	Joelle	368.07	369.75	like junior to senior year I was like
Jo	Joelle	369.75	371.28	you know I'm gonna be friendly but I can
Jo	Joelle	371.28	372.81	just be myself
Jo	Joelle	372.81	374.639	and relax I don't need to feel like I'm
Jo	Joelle	374.639	376.86	compensating so in a weird way I wasn't
Jo	Joelle	376.86	378.45	changing so much what I was doing but it
Jo	Joelle	378.45	379.77	was coming from a different motivation
Jo	Joelle	379.77	381.96	of being authentic and being a good
Jo	Joelle	381.96	383.94	person rather than trying to make people
Jo	Joelle	383.94	385.469	see me a certain way and it was so much
Jo	Joelle	385.469	386.76	healthier and I was so much less
Jo	Joelle	386.76	387.93	exhausted
Jo	Joelle	387.93	390.06	and yeah I was so thankful that it came
Jo	Joelle	390.06	392.13	to that like revelation Oh another thing
Jo	Joelle	392.13	393.3	that I would do in high school though
Jo	Joelle	393.3	395.46	was that I would constant like right
Jo	Joelle	395.46	396.81	starting freshman year oh no super
Jo	Joelle	396.81	399.0	insecure was that I would always make
Jo	Joelle	399.0	401.07	Asian jokes about myself before
Jo	Joelle	401.07	403.08	something else could like I would assume
Jo	Joelle	403.08	405.57	that if I was talking about my grades or
Jo	Joelle	405.57	408.33	that I play piano I'd be like oh yeah
Jo	Joelle	408.33	409.86	you know cuz I'm Asian so like we just
Jo	Joelle	409.86	412.169	do that and it wasn't till one of my
Jo	Joelle	412.169	415.5	friends who's half Chinese pointed out
Jo	Joelle	415.5	417.18	and he was like Joe well like why do you
Jo	Joelle	417.18	419.55	always point it's being Asian like you
Jo	Joelle	419.55	420.87	know people aren't always gonna assume
Jo	Joelle	420.87	422.43	that you're doing these things cuz
Jo	Joelle	422.43	424.68	you're Asian and it really took him
Jo	Joelle	424.68	426.9	calling me out to be like oh wow like
Jo	Joelle	426.9	428.52	I'm internalizing it like this is
Jo	Joelle	428.52	430.83	internalized racism like I am so afraid
Jo	Joelle	430.83	432.57	of someone making fun of me that I feel
Jo	Joelle	432.57	434.4	the need to make fun of myself and call
Jo	Joelle	434.4	436.05	myself out for being Asian as if it's a
Jo	Joelle	436.05	436.71	bad thing
Jo	Joelle	436.71	438.24	so they don't have to do it first and
Jo	Joelle	438.24	440.88	after that I was like I need to stop and
Jo	Joelle	440.88	443.58	that was really good wake-up call so if
Jo	Joelle	443.58	445.919	you ever see this love you dude thank
Jo	Joelle	445.919	448.139	you so I put the pink on my lower lash
Jo	Joelle	448.139	450.03	line upper lash line and I think when
Jo	Joelle	450.03	452.31	you say I take peach sangria and use a
Jo	Joelle	452.31	454.05	little bit of it to deepen up the outer
Jo	Joelle	454.05	456.36	corner but next question is were you
Jo	Joelle	456.36	457.68	always proud of your heritage or was
Jo	Joelle	457.68	459.09	there a time where you rejected it and I
Jo	Joelle	459.09	460.71	would say at that time in high school
Jo	Joelle	460.71	464.61	when I felt like I am a classic model
Jo	Joelle	464.61	467.28	minority which is a myth for anyone who
Jo	Joelle	467.28	469.11	hasn't seen Amy's video on this go watch
Jo	Joelle	469.11	470.46	it until one about the model minority
Jo	Joelle	470.46	473.52	myth I felt like I needed to compensate
Jo	Joelle	473.52	477.15	for me being Asian even though I
Jo	Joelle	477.15	478.77	shouldn't have seen it as a weakness I
Jo	Joelle	478.77	482.22	did and I was super unhealthy and I
Jo	Joelle	482.22	484.259	didn't necessarily want to reject it I
Jo	Joelle	484.259	485.729	would still do what I was naturally
Jo	Joelle	485.729	489.479	going to do but I felt like I had to be
Jo	Joelle	489.479	491.699	okay with like taking a hit for it
Jo	Joelle	491.699	493.44	almost like socially that people look
Jo	Joelle	493.44	495.36	down on me when really I shouldn't have
Jo	Joelle	495.36	497.13	expected that that's just not the
Jo	Joelle	497.13	498.419	reality that we should live with and
Jo	Joelle	498.419	500.009	internalized course number five what are
Jo	Joelle	500.009	501.659	some stereotypes you struggle with I
Jo	Joelle	501.659	504.72	would say that I struggle a lot less now
Jo	Joelle	504.72	508.02	with stereotypes I think one thing I do
Jo	Joelle	508.02	509.46	still kind of struggle with is like
Jo	Joelle	509.46	511.56	being compared with other Asian girls
Jo	Joelle	511.56	513.3	like I think going to a predominantly
Jo	Joelle	513.3	516.12	white college it's really easy for like
Jo	Joelle	516.12	518.419	Asian girls to be you know kind of
Jo	Joelle	518.419	520.01	next to each other especially if they
Jo	Joelle	520.01	521.57	have similar interests and whatnot and
Jo	Joelle	521.57	523.49	just being like okay who's like the
Jo	Joelle	523.49	525.29	superior asian girl or who's the
Jo	Joelle	525.29	527.18	prettier asian girl and I definitely
Jo	Joelle	527.18	529.07	struggle with that especially in my
Jo	Joelle	529.07	531.01	sophomore year where I felt like after
Jo	Joelle	531.01	533.75	rushing and enjoying a sorority like I
Jo	Joelle	533.75	535.699	felt like that was you know Augmented
Jo	Joelle	535.699	537.62	just me being compared to other Asian
Jo	Joelle	537.62	538.88	girls because there was like some sort
Jo	Joelle	538.88	540.769	of quota that Greek houses were trying
Jo	Joelle	540.769	542.81	to fit because Greek houses can be
Jo	Joelle	542.81	544.639	racist but I think I've gotten over that
Jo	Joelle	544.639	546.769	a lot first after taking a gap year what
Jo	Joelle	546.769	549.35	you can hear all about my gap year vlogs
Jo	Joelle	549.35	552.17	so this is really messy as you can tell
Jo	Joelle	552.17	554.24	but I'm gonna blend it out with blending
Jo	Joelle	554.24	556.31	brush and that makes everything better
Jo	Joelle	556.31	558.079	but going back to the stereotype thing
Jo	Joelle	558.079	559.399	when I was younger I definitely
Jo	Joelle	559.399	560.959	struggled with being like the goody
Jo	Joelle	560.959	563.529	two-shoes a lot and I felt really
Jo	Joelle	563.529	565.519	self-conscious in like middle school
Jo	Joelle	565.519	568.55	that like I know I was just so nerdy and
Jo	Joelle	568.55	570.29	I did everything right and I felt like
Jo	Joelle	570.29	572.329	it was a bad thing I felt like people
Jo	Joelle	572.329	573.8	were gonna call me out for because I was
Jo	Joelle	573.8	575.779	Asian and instead of giving me credit
Jo	Joelle	575.779	577.22	for it and being like wow that's really
Jo	Joelle	577.22	579.769	impressive that you can like play piano
Jo	Joelle	579.769	582.17	and you get good grades and all of that
Jo	Joelle	582.17	583.49	they just be like well it's just cuz
Jo	Joelle	583.49	585.05	you're Asian and I was so annoyed that I
Jo	Joelle	585.05	587.149	was not getting credit for hard work
Jo	Joelle	587.149	590.089	because it was being just thrown on my
Jo	Joelle	590.089	592.31	race and that actually connects to the
Jo	Joelle	592.31	595.97	model minority myth that Asians are you
Jo	Joelle	595.97	597.649	know somehow genetically
Jo	Joelle	597.649	601.07	good at things and it really discredits
Jo	Joelle	601.07	603.079	a lot of Asians for what they've done
Jo	Joelle	603.079	604.85	and what they've contributed to society
Jo	Joelle	604.85	607.64	and also is really good at causing
Jo	Joelle	607.64	610.04	division between minorities when there
Jo	Joelle	610.04	612.41	should not be any and it's really good
Jo	Joelle	612.41	614.75	for causing division between Asians when
Jo	Joelle	614.75	616.76	they feel like they don't fit into the
Jo	Joelle	616.76	618.14	model minority myth and I feel like they
Jo	Joelle	618.14	620.18	failed in some way next I'm gonna take a
Jo	Joelle	620.18	622.88	little bit of peaches and cream and just
Jo	Joelle	622.88	625.73	throw that on the center of my lids and
Jo	Joelle	625.73	627.41	next to line my eyes I'm gonna use milk
Jo	Joelle	627.41	631.22	makeups shadow liner in the shade BP
Jo	Joelle	631.22	633.5	just a brown color question number six
Jo	Joelle	633.5	635.42	is can you speak your language so for me
Jo	Joelle	635.42	638.63	that would be Chinese or Cantonese and
Jo	Joelle	638.63	642.05	Korean I cannot unfortunately which is
Jo	Joelle	642.05	643.88	something that I'm really sad about but
Jo	Joelle	643.88	645.32	I've been trying to learn Korean
Jo	Joelle	645.32	646.58	last year a little bit I went on a
Jo	Joelle	646.58	649.61	missions trip to Korea and I picked up
Jo	Joelle	649.61	652.55	some words and I can kind of like read a
Jo	Joelle	652.55	655.04	little bit in Hangul but I'm really bad
Jo	Joelle	655.04	658.73	at it but my boyfriend's Korean and he
Jo	Joelle	658.73	661.22	helps me out try to learn a few words
Jo	Joelle	661.22	663.77	question number seven is husby engaging
Jo	Joelle	663.77	665.21	American affected your relationship with
Jo	Joelle	665.21	667.91	your parents and I think it definitely
Jo	Joelle	667.91	669.68	affected a little more when I was
Jo	Joelle	669.68	671.63	younger my mom wasn't a create like a
Jo	Joelle	671.63	673.52	legit tiger mom but she was a little
Jo	Joelle	673.52	674.96	tiger mom ish you know definitely
Jo	Joelle	674.96	676.79	whipped us into shape but I was honestly
Jo	Joelle	676.79	678.23	very thankful for it like I said I was a
Jo	Joelle	678.23	680.0	goody two-shoes kid my parents are both
Jo	Joelle	680.0	682.55	first generation and grew up in the
Jo	Joelle	682.55	684.71	States and can speak perfect English and
Jo	Joelle	684.71	686.3	I'm really thankful for that that we
Jo	Joelle	686.3	688.04	never had communication issues but
Jo	Joelle	688.04	690.07	definitely you know generational values
Jo	Joelle	690.07	692.69	that they grew up with or a lot harsher
Jo	Joelle	692.69	695.89	and more strict than what we see as
Jo	Joelle	695.89	698.36	Americans we were just like no other
Jo	Joelle	698.36	700.19	family or no other kids have to follow
Jo	Joelle	700.19	702.26	these kinds of rules like doing the next
Jo	Joelle	702.26	704.15	year's math over the summer before the
Jo	Joelle	704.15	706.73	school year or just strictness and how
Jo	Joelle	706.73	709.03	we had to dress and stuff like that but
Jo	Joelle	709.03	711.53	at the same time I think I was really
Jo	Joelle	711.53	713.15	I'm really thankful that I saw the value
Jo	Joelle	713.15	715.61	and everything my parents did and wanted
Jo	Joelle	715.61	718.34	us to do and also my my family is very
Jo	Joelle	718.34	720.65	strongly Christian and I think that
Jo	Joelle	720.65	723.83	really helped interestingly my parents
Jo	Joelle	723.83	726.47	got less strict as they became more
Jo	Joelle	726.47	728.99	Christian because the stuff that they
Jo	Joelle	728.99	730.34	wanted us to focus on became very
Jo	Joelle	730.34	731.66	different so rather than being so
Jo	Joelle	731.66	734.84	concerned about math and reading and
Jo	Joelle	734.84	736.58	scores and stuff they're like okay we
Jo	Joelle	736.58	737.9	want you to be happy we want you to grow
Jo	Joelle	737.9	740.18	up we want you to grow up loving God and
Jo	Joelle	740.18	741.92	knowing your identity and knowing that
Jo	Joelle	741.92	744.35	you're valued so we're gonna focus on
Jo	Joelle	744.35	746.75	that and that was honestly so so helpful
Jo	Joelle	746.75	748.31	for my relationship with my parents and
Jo	Joelle	748.31	750.59	I'm so thankful for it on the other hand
Jo	Joelle	750.59	752.18	going up Asian American has definitely
Jo	Joelle	752.18	754.52	made my relationship with my
Jo	Joelle	754.52	756.53	grandparents and extended family very
Jo	Joelle	756.53	758.48	interesting especially my grandparents
Jo	Joelle	758.48	760.01	just like a lot of different values I
Jo	Joelle	760.01	762.08	know there's a lot of racism also in
Jo	Joelle	762.08	764.3	especially in Korean culture I know
Jo	Joelle	764.3	766.01	that's obviously not true of all Koreans
Jo	Joelle	766.01	767.81	but it's just like a thing there's a lot
Jo	Joelle	767.81	770.96	of pride in like your nationality which
Jo	Joelle	770.96	772.88	is awesome but also it can result in
Jo	Joelle	772.88	775.01	like discrimination against people who
Jo	Joelle	775.01	778.75	are not Korean so I
Jo	Joelle	778.75	781.09	a half chinese half Korean family that
Jo	Joelle	781.09	782.8	obviously can cause some issues as you
Jo	Joelle	782.8	784.96	can imagine my trip to Korea was
Jo	Joelle	784.96	787.0	honestly so like super healing of that
Jo	Joelle	787.0	789.25	and I feel like God just like did a lot
Jo	Joelle	789.25	791.23	my heart that trip to like give me
Jo	Joelle	791.23	792.88	empathy and show where their time from
Jo	Joelle	792.88	794.13	and also show that it's like something
Jo	Joelle	794.13	796.57	that like they grew up with just
Jo	Joelle	796.57	798.25	historically through Wars through
Jo	Joelle	798.25	799.9	whatever and it's also got a lot better
Jo	Joelle	799.9	802.33	where they don't openly show as much
Jo	Joelle	802.33	804.4	discrimination towards Chinese people so
Jo	Joelle	804.4	806.11	oh that's good
Jo	Joelle	806.11	808.0	course number eight is how do you feel
Jo	Joelle	808.0	809.53	about your heritage now do you identify
Jo	Joelle	809.53	811.63	with it and I would say I've definitely
Jo	Joelle	811.63	813.34	throughout college high school and
Jo	Joelle	813.34	816.04	college going to be a lot more vocal
Jo	Joelle	816.04	818.77	about like my Asian pride I guess I've
Jo	Joelle	818.77	821.38	learned a lot more about specifically
Jo	Joelle	821.38	823.14	what it means to be Chinese or Korean
Jo	Joelle	823.14	826.54	American through friends and through
Jo	Joelle	826.54	829.45	just life education and growing up and
Jo	Joelle	829.45	830.41	realizing that it's something so
Jo	Joelle	830.41	832.45	valuable to hold on to I also feel like
Jo	Joelle	832.45	834.82	my relationship with God has also helped
Jo	Joelle	834.82	837.85	me to really just acknowledge the fact
Jo	Joelle	837.85	839.89	that I was made intentionally like me
Jo	Joelle	839.89	842.53	being half chinese half Korean was by
Jo	Joelle	842.53	845.589	God's design and that I should look for
Jo	Joelle	845.589	848.17	the strengths and that which to me is I
Jo	Joelle	848.17	850.33	have the opportunity to help represent
Jo	Joelle	850.33	853.39	and help elevate people of color and
Jo	Joelle	853.39	855.58	other Asian American girls help push the
Jo	Joelle	855.58	857.56	Asian American representation forward
Jo	Joelle	857.56	860.2	through media through education and
Jo	Joelle	860.2	862.27	whatever and though it can definitely be
Jo	Joelle	862.27	863.86	seen as like a burden I'm like you know
Jo	Joelle	863.86	866.74	what like if that is what something
Jo	Joelle	866.74	868.51	God's called me to I'm gonna take it and
Jo	Joelle	868.51	869.32	run with it
Jo	Joelle	869.32	870.91	sorry I totally just stop saying yes
Jo	Joelle	870.91	872.5	what I'm doing but next I'm gonna
Jo	Joelle	872.5	875.47	contour with my Too Faced cocoa contour
Jo	Joelle	875.47	877.27	palette and Amy's last question number
Jo	Joelle	877.27	878.41	nine is what is your favorite thing
Jo	Joelle	878.41	880.6	about being Asian American slash your
Jo	Joelle	880.6	883.12	heritage I would say I love that I feel
Jo	Joelle	883.12	883.99	like I have something to bring to the
Jo	Joelle	883.99	886.87	table I love that I have a family with a
Jo	Joelle	886.87	889.78	history and I love the values of Asian
Jo	Joelle	889.78	892.93	culture of working hard and those are
Jo	Joelle	892.93	894.91	things that are kind of often lost in
Jo	Joelle	894.91	897.25	Western culture I love the art and
Jo	Joelle	897.25	899.38	aesthetics of Asian culture both Chinese
Jo	Joelle	899.38	901.72	and Korean I love the food both Chinese
Jo	Joelle	901.72	903.7	and Korean I don't know I feel like it
Jo	Joelle	903.7	906.19	gives me something about myself that
Jo	Joelle	906.19	908.35	provides community in a really
Jo	Joelle	908.35	910.66	full way just you know uniting with
Jo	Joelle	910.66	913.69	other asian-americans and also just
Jo	Joelle	913.69	915.28	something to protect as I get older
Jo	Joelle	915.28	918.46	since America is this amazing wonderful
Jo	Joelle	918.46	920.47	melting pot of cultures but there's also
Jo	Joelle	920.47	922.78	like the integrity of it that I've
Jo	Joelle	922.78	924.67	started to learn the value of as we
Jo	Joelle	924.67	926.32	become a culture of like you know the
Jo	Joelle	926.32	928.57	mixing pot and whatever that it's really
Jo	Joelle	928.57	930.1	important to see the distinction and
Jo	Joelle	930.1	932.53	hold on to the history of what it means
Jo	Joelle	932.53	934.45	to be Korean American or Chinese
Jo	Joelle	934.45	936.61	American and I'm actually gonna answer
Jo	Joelle	936.61	938.71	one bonus question because I get this
Jo	Joelle	938.71	940.81	question a lot and that is do you feel
Jo	Joelle	940.81	943.6	more Chinese or more Korean having grown
Jo	Joelle	943.6	945.76	up as you know a mixed Chinese
Jo	Joelle	945.76	948.79	korean-american as I'm putting on this
Jo	Joelle	948.79	951.49	blush from was this from the faceshop
Jo	Joelle	951.49	953.32	it's just a really peachy blush Dee with
Jo	Joelle	953.32	953.59	her
Jo	Joelle	953.59	955.42	peachy makeup look and I actually
Jo	Joelle	955.42	958.0	personally so I grew up in San Francisco
Jo	Joelle	958.0	960.1	go there's a huge huge tiniest
Jo	Joelle	960.1	962.86	population and so I grew up with a lot
Jo	Joelle	962.86	965.32	more Chinese culture I was also largely
Jo	Joelle	965.32	967.72	raised by my mom who was Chinese my dad
Jo	Joelle	967.72	969.85	worked a lot and I sought to say that he
Jo	Joelle	969.85	971.86	wasn't present in my life but like the
Jo	Joelle	971.86	973.6	value systems and like the ways of
Jo	Joelle	973.6	975.34	thinking the food that my mom prepared
Jo	Joelle	975.34	977.86	was largely Chinese so I feel like I
Jo	Joelle	977.86	978.88	grew up with a lot of Chinese influence
Jo	Joelle	978.88	980.62	not even realizing it just cuz it was so
Jo	Joelle	980.62	981.97	normal like we would go to the Chinese
Jo	Joelle	981.97	984.49	grocery store and we would make wontons
Jo	Joelle	984.49	986.77	together and you know stuff like that
Jo	Joelle	986.77	989.08	you know we got Chinese New Year off for
Jo	Joelle	989.08	990.58	school because it was such a big there's
Jo	Joelle	990.58	992.59	such a big Chinese population also
Jo	Joelle	992.59	995.16	highlighting with a face job highlighter
Jo	Joelle	995.16	998.68	but as I've gone to college I've gotten
Jo	Joelle	998.68	1001.76	to get to know a lot more Koreans and
Jo	Joelle	1001.76	1003.93	learn what it even means to be
Jo	Joelle	1003.93	1005.46	korean-american I literally didn't grow
Jo	Joelle	1005.46	1007.17	up around any Korean Americans until
Jo	Joelle	1007.17	1009.69	college like high school there was one
Jo	Joelle	1009.69	1011.43	of the Korean Roland and we never went
Jo	Joelle	1011.43	1013.47	to a Korean Church what we did but I was
Jo	Joelle	1013.47	1015.0	like an infant so it's been really cool
Jo	Joelle	1015.0	1016.8	getting to know what it means to be
Jo	Joelle	1016.8	1018.54	Korean I would say it's really hard like
Jo	Joelle	1018.54	1020.16	I don't ever want to choose one and say
Jo	Joelle	1020.16	1022.38	that like oh I feel more Korean or more
Jo	Joelle	1022.38	1024.36	Chinese and just kind of ignore the
Jo	Joelle	1024.36	1026.25	other one but I would say they came into
Jo	Joelle	1026.25	1027.93	my lives at very different points in
Jo	Joelle	1027.93	1029.58	time just because of the environment I
Jo	Joelle	1029.58	1032.52	was in and the people I was around but I
Jo	Joelle	1032.52	1033.93	would say they're both equally valuable
Jo	Joelle	1033.93	1036.51	to me and you know my parents are both
Jo	Joelle	1036.51	1038.35	equally valuable to me and
Jo	Joelle	1038.35	1041.5	different influences on me personality
Jo	Joelle	1041.5	1044.11	wise and culturally are both really
Jo	Joelle	1044.11	1046.809	important and play I think equally heavy
Jo	Joelle	1046.809	1051.37	roles so I'd say I'm pretty even split
Jo	Joelle	1051.37	1053.5	as boring of an answer as that is a
Jo	Joelle	1053.5	1055.299	whoops I forgot my lip color oh my gosh
Jo	Joelle	1055.299	1059.89	okay I'm just using siren by Revlon okay
Jo	Joelle	1059.89	1061.299	I first discovered this lipstick because
