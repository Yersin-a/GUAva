We	WeylieHoang	5.319	8.059	hi everyone and welcome back to your
We	WeylieHoang	8.059	8.96	girls Channel
We	WeylieHoang	8.96	11.12	so today I have a topic that I've been
We	WeylieHoang	11.12	13.04	wanting to talk about for years now and
We	WeylieHoang	13.04	14.929	I don't know why I never really got
We	WeylieHoang	14.929	17.0	around to talking about it a part of me
We	WeylieHoang	17.0	18.529	feels like it's not something that
We	WeylieHoang	18.529	20.689	people would be necessarily interested
We	WeylieHoang	20.689	22.31	in but as I'm getting older more and
We	WeylieHoang	22.31	23.96	more I find myself thinking about this
We	WeylieHoang	23.96	25.91	almost on a daily basis and whether or
We	WeylieHoang	25.91	27.38	not this is something that affects your
We	WeylieHoang	27.38	29.059	life I hope that this is a video that
We	WeylieHoang	29.059	30.95	you can pass on to people in your life
We	WeylieHoang	30.95	32.239	that are probably dealing with the same
We	WeylieHoang	32.239	35.0	thing because growing up for me this was
We	WeylieHoang	35.0	36.44	something that was really hard and I
We	WeylieHoang	36.44	38.09	didn't realize I played such a huge role
We	WeylieHoang	38.09	40.46	in my life until my adulthood and the
We	WeylieHoang	40.46	42.11	topic is about growing up as a
We	WeylieHoang	42.11	44.3	chinese-american and obviously you do
We	WeylieHoang	44.3	45.62	not have to be Chinese to be watching
We	WeylieHoang	45.62	47.06	this video I'm just sharing with you
We	WeylieHoang	47.06	49.46	guys my experience and how I grew up so
We	WeylieHoang	49.46	52.04	just apply it in your own life and with
We	WeylieHoang	52.04	53.78	that being said let's just jump right in
We	WeylieHoang	53.78	55.37	and get started so I want to start off
We	WeylieHoang	55.37	57.079	to give a little backstory in case you
We	WeylieHoang	57.079	59.36	guys are new to my channel so when I was
We	WeylieHoang	59.36	61.52	growing up my parents never really like
We	WeylieHoang	61.52	63.71	told me oh Whaley you're Chinese or
We	WeylieHoang	63.71	64.549	you're Asian
We	WeylieHoang	64.549	66.11	believe it or not growing up I didn't
We	WeylieHoang	66.11	67.25	even realize that there were other
We	WeylieHoang	67.25	68.57	ethnic backgrounds in the world I
We	WeylieHoang	68.57	70.82	thought we were all the same people I
We	WeylieHoang	70.82	72.11	obviously noticed a difference between
We	WeylieHoang	72.11	73.97	me and my classmates I would see that we
We	WeylieHoang	73.97	75.68	have different hair colors different eye
We	WeylieHoang	75.68	77.39	colors and we would speak a different
We	WeylieHoang	77.39	79.7	language back at home but for some
We	WeylieHoang	79.7	81.14	reason and never clicked to me because
We	WeylieHoang	81.14	82.67	my parents never like drilled in my head
We	WeylieHoang	82.67	84.71	like oh you're Asian or you're Chinese I
We	WeylieHoang	84.71	86.9	just saw everyone as human beings and
We	WeylieHoang	86.9	89.03	that may sound stupid to y'all but for
We	WeylieHoang	89.03	90.47	real I did not know the difference
We	WeylieHoang	90.47	92.51	growing up I just thought everyone was
We	WeylieHoang	92.51	93.83	taught different things in their
We	WeylieHoang	93.83	95.72	household but I didn't realize that
We	WeylieHoang	95.72	97.729	meant that we came from a different like
We	WeylieHoang	97.729	99.35	ethnic background so the first day of
We	WeylieHoang	99.35	101.36	preschool rolled around and it was
We	WeylieHoang	101.36	103.43	nothing like I expected it I grew up
We	WeylieHoang	103.43	105.38	just speaking Cantonese Chinese whatever
We	WeylieHoang	105.38	106.939	you want to call it in my family my
We	WeylieHoang	106.939	108.29	family didn't see the need of teaching
We	WeylieHoang	108.29	109.85	me English because they felt like well
We	WeylieHoang	109.85	111.439	she's gonna learn it in school anyway so
We	WeylieHoang	111.439	113.18	might as well teach her like her native
We	WeylieHoang	113.18	114.47	tongue serve on my voice I'm like
We	WeylieHoang	114.47	116.75	recovering from a cold so this voice is
We	WeylieHoang	116.75	118.49	just all weird since I all right but
We	WeylieHoang	118.49	119.63	going back to what I was saying my
We	WeylieHoang	119.63	122.06	parents did not teach me a word of
We	WeylieHoang	122.06	123.77	English I probably knew things like
We	WeylieHoang	123.77	126.83	Apple I knew my name and that's pretty
We	WeylieHoang	126.83	128.36	much about it I didn't know English at
We	WeylieHoang	128.36	129.979	all going into preschool so I remember
We	WeylieHoang	129.979	132.29	going to school looking at everyone it
We	WeylieHoang	132.29	135.439	was like what are they saying eventually
We	WeylieHoang	135.439	137.15	by the end of preschool I picked up on
We	WeylieHoang	137.15	137.73	the lane
We	WeylieHoang	137.73	139.53	and we went into kindergarten and I
We	WeylieHoang	139.53	142.049	understood English just fine then third
We	WeylieHoang	142.049	144.209	grade came around and third grade was
We	WeylieHoang	144.209	146.31	about the time mark where I started
We	WeylieHoang	146.31	148.23	feeling uncomfortable about being
We	WeylieHoang	148.23	150.15	Chinese growing up in my family all we
We	WeylieHoang	150.15	151.83	ate was Chinese food every meal
We	WeylieHoang	151.83	153.959	consisted of rice so you each have your
We	WeylieHoang	153.959	155.549	bowl of rice and then there's all the
We	WeylieHoang	155.549	157.47	meats and veggies or whatever and we all
We	WeylieHoang	157.47	159.66	share it hardly did I ever eat anything
We	WeylieHoang	159.66	162.48	outside of Chinese food the only like
We	WeylieHoang	162.48	164.97	taste of American food I would get would
We	WeylieHoang	164.97	167.67	probably be like McDonald's or sometimes
We	WeylieHoang	167.67	169.019	we would go to Denny's which is a diner
We	WeylieHoang	169.019	170.61	sorry I think I said third grade earlier
We	WeylieHoang	170.61	172.11	but I'm in second grade second grade is
We	WeylieHoang	172.11	174.9	the first time I started feeling any
We	WeylieHoang	174.9	177.15	sort of discrimination second grade not
We	WeylieHoang	177.15	178.709	third grade in second grade I moved to a
We	WeylieHoang	178.709	180.359	new school and I was super excited about
We	WeylieHoang	180.359	182.129	it and I wanted to buy school lunches
We	WeylieHoang	182.129	183.45	because I've always kind of like brought
We	WeylieHoang	183.45	185.43	my own lunch and no one's ever really
We	WeylieHoang	185.43	186.569	said anything about it I think it's
We	WeylieHoang	186.569	187.92	because we were younger at the time in
We	WeylieHoang	187.92	189.54	second grade I decided the first day of
We	WeylieHoang	189.54	191.879	school mom I want to buy lunch at school
We	WeylieHoang	191.879	193.95	I just wanted to try it so my parents
We	WeylieHoang	193.95	195.599	gave me lunch money that day and when I
We	WeylieHoang	195.599	197.22	went into the lunch line I remember
We	WeylieHoang	197.22	199.14	looking at everything and I was just
We	WeylieHoang	199.14	201.69	like how do you eat this after that day
We	WeylieHoang	201.69	203.19	I went home and I was telling my mom
We	WeylieHoang	203.19	205.319	like I don't really like the food like
We	WeylieHoang	205.319	207.269	that's not what I want to eat so I think
We	WeylieHoang	207.269	208.56	I'm just gonna go back to bringing my
We	WeylieHoang	208.56	210.63	own food so my mom was like cool okay
We	WeylieHoang	210.63	211.829	growing up something that my parents
We	WeylieHoang	211.829	213.72	would always make like this was my
We	WeylieHoang	213.72	215.79	favorite thing this was my dream I ate
We	WeylieHoang	215.79	217.38	it almost every single day
We	WeylieHoang	217.38	219.78	and it is pork belly with pickled
We	WeylieHoang	219.78	222.15	mustard greens it's like a stew that you
We	WeylieHoang	222.15	225.239	would make and it was just uh it was so
We	WeylieHoang	225.239	227.7	so good anytime that my mom made sooner
We	WeylieHoang	227.7	230.43	I caught you I would be like oh today is
We	WeylieHoang	230.43	231.209	my lucky day
We	WeylieHoang	231.209	233.16	so that night my mom made a big old pot
We	WeylieHoang	233.16	234.569	of its unless she can pack me lunch for
We	WeylieHoang	234.569	236.04	the next day and she put it in like this
We	WeylieHoang	236.04	238.38	like thermal warmer thing it was like a
We	WeylieHoang	238.38	240.269	it was like a cup like this there were
We	WeylieHoang	240.269	242.069	layers on the top she put my rice and on
We	WeylieHoang	242.069	244.319	the bottom she put the meat and I was so
We	WeylieHoang	244.319	246.12	excited about lunch time okay girl like
We	WeylieHoang	246.12	247.68	I knew that was in my lunch bag and like
We	WeylieHoang	247.68	249.06	while I was in class I was like looking
We	WeylieHoang	249.06	250.98	forward to lunch I'm like I cannot wait
We	WeylieHoang	250.98	252.78	to eat this so by the time I get to

We	WeylieHoang	261.81	263.729	at me and then they're like what is that
We	WeylieHoang	263.729	266.039	smell and at first I thought they
We	WeylieHoang	266.039	267.9	thought it smelled good cuz to me this
We	WeylieHoang	267.9	268.46	was a
We	WeylieHoang	268.46	270.139	I grew up with and this smells [ __ ]
We	WeylieHoang	270.139	272.33	amazing if you ask me so I'm all like
We	WeylieHoang	272.33	273.86	excited I'm like oh you want to know
We	WeylieHoang	273.86	276.08	what I'm eating okay they all come over
We	WeylieHoang	276.08	277.58	and they're all like hovering over and
We	WeylieHoang	277.58	278.96	they're like what is that like what is
We	WeylieHoang	278.96	281.27	that smell so I was like oh it's a pork
We	WeylieHoang	281.27	283.25	belly with like pickled veggies it's a
We	WeylieHoang	283.25	285.349	Chinese dish and then after I said pork
We	WeylieHoang	285.349	287.12	belly I don't know if it's cuz in
We	WeylieHoang	287.12	289.729	America you don't call bacon pork belly
We	WeylieHoang	289.729	291.8	you call it bacon but it's really pork
We	WeylieHoang	291.8	293.18	belly I don't know the second I said
We	WeylieHoang	293.18	296.09	pork belly everyone freaked down they're
We	WeylieHoang	296.09	300.11	like hey what are you eating why are you
We	WeylieHoang	300.11	302.57	eating that that's so disgusting
We	WeylieHoang	302.57	304.789	oh my god it smells so bad literally
We	WeylieHoang	304.789	306.259	everyone just started talking about it
We	WeylieHoang	306.259	307.31	and they made it seem like the most
We	WeylieHoang	307.31	309.32	disgusting thing ever they all walked
We	WeylieHoang	309.32	312.259	away and I remember just like my heart
We	WeylieHoang	312.259	315.139	sunk I felt so embarrassed but I didn't
We	WeylieHoang	315.139	316.52	even know what I was embarrassed about
We	WeylieHoang	316.52	318.32	because I literally went from oh my god
We	WeylieHoang	318.32	320.21	I'm so proud that I'm eating this and
We	WeylieHoang	320.21	322.639	I'm having this - oh my god why did
We	WeylieHoang	322.639	324.5	everyone freak out I don't understand
We	WeylieHoang	324.5	327.139	I felt so so embarrassed like I didn't
We	WeylieHoang	327.139	328.639	even know if I should even eat anymore
We	WeylieHoang	328.639	330.409	at that point I was really hungry it
We	WeylieHoang	330.409	331.789	smelled really good I wanted to eat it
We	WeylieHoang	331.789	333.919	but because everyone looked at me as if
We	WeylieHoang	333.919	336.08	it's so disgusting I felt like if I ate
We	WeylieHoang	336.08	338.419	it that would mean I'm disgusting so I
We	WeylieHoang	338.419	339.83	took a few bites and I just put it away
We	WeylieHoang	339.83	342.05	and I pretended like I didn't even like
We	WeylieHoang	342.05	344.389	it myself and I remember just feeling so
We	WeylieHoang	344.389	346.19	disgusted with myself because I was
We	WeylieHoang	346.19	348.409	lying to myself you know I wanted to fit
We	WeylieHoang	348.409	350.06	in so I acted like something that I
We	WeylieHoang	350.06	351.77	liked and something that I was so proud
We	WeylieHoang	351.77	353.78	of what's disgusting to me so the next
We	WeylieHoang	353.78	355.31	door I want to talk about is the day I
We	WeylieHoang	355.31	358.28	found out I was Chinese okay it was a
We	WeylieHoang	358.28	361.34	day in third grade where a new kid came
We	WeylieHoang	361.34	363.02	to our school I believe he was Taiwanese
We	WeylieHoang	363.02	365.449	so he spoke Mandarin and he had a really
We	WeylieHoang	365.449	367.52	flat face which I hate to even say that
We	WeylieHoang	367.52	368.659	but let's just be real like I have a
We	WeylieHoang	368.659	370.61	really flat face and seriously can we
We	WeylieHoang	370.61	371.99	talk about this without people getting
We	WeylieHoang	371.99	373.669	offended I'm just gonna be real and just
We	WeylieHoang	373.669	376.55	describe what I feel okay most Asian
We	WeylieHoang	376.55	379.25	people do have more of a flatter profile
We	WeylieHoang	379.25	381.139	and if you don't that's great I'm not
We	WeylieHoang	381.139	383.87	saying all Asians do many of us don't
We	WeylieHoang	383.87	385.759	have really prominent cheekbones we
We	WeylieHoang	385.759	387.469	don't have deep set eyes I remember
We	WeylieHoang	387.469	389.33	that's how a nice kid he had a really
We	WeylieHoang	389.33	391.34	really flat face like even more flat
We	WeylieHoang	391.34	393.979	than mine and all the kids in class were
We	WeylieHoang	393.979	395.84	making fun of him and I overheard them
We	WeylieHoang	395.84	397.25	and they're just like he has such a flat
We	WeylieHoang	397.25	398.659	face like did he get slapped or
We	WeylieHoang	398.659	399.81	something growing up grow
We	WeylieHoang	399.81	401.76	I was someone that just listened to
We	WeylieHoang	401.76	403.32	everybody else I never really had an
We	WeylieHoang	403.32	405.21	opinion of my own like if that's what
We	WeylieHoang	405.21	406.68	the majority is saying I'm gonna be like
We	WeylieHoang	406.68	408.21	okay yeah you're right so there was a
We	WeylieHoang	408.21	410.01	moment where those mean kids looked at
We	WeylieHoang	410.01	412.139	me and they looked at me as if they were
We	WeylieHoang	412.139	414.48	waiting for me to like jump in and say
We	WeylieHoang	414.48	416.22	something too and me being the loser
We	WeylieHoang	416.22	417.69	that I was I'm just like oh [ __ ] that's
We	WeylieHoang	417.69	419.46	what they're saying like I need to agree
We	WeylieHoang	419.46	420.66	with them because otherwise they would
We	WeylieHoang	420.66	422.49	laugh at me so I say back to them like
We	WeylieHoang	422.49	424.65	yeah he has such a flat face and then
We	WeylieHoang	424.65	427.23	they all bursted out laughing looked at
We	WeylieHoang	427.23	428.79	me and one of the guys were like so do
We	WeylieHoang	428.79	430.11	you aren't you guys the same or
We	WeylieHoang	430.11	431.94	something so that day after school I go
We	WeylieHoang	431.94	433.8	home and I tell my mom and I'm like kids
We	WeylieHoang	433.8	435.0	at school were making fun of me saying
We	WeylieHoang	435.0	436.47	that I have a flat face like do I have a
We	WeylieHoang	436.47	438.33	flat face I remember my mom saying like
We	WeylieHoang	438.33	440.04	hey hold on let me sigh don't say Casey
We	WeylieHoang	440.04	441.69	well they didn't go again then which in
We	WeylieHoang	441.69	443.07	translation my mom was just like huh
We	WeylieHoang	443.07	444.75	maybe it's just those kids making fun of
We	WeylieHoang	444.75	446.49	us Asian people and I was just like
We	WeylieHoang	446.49	448.83	what's the difference so my mom broke it
We	WeylieHoang	448.83	450.66	down to me explained to me that you know
We	WeylieHoang	450.66	453.06	we are different like we are minorities
We	WeylieHoang	453.06	455.639	in this country and bla bla bla so on so
We	WeylieHoang	455.639	458.04	forth and that for me explained so much
We	WeylieHoang	458.04	461.22	about why I don't eat food that kids at
We	WeylieHoang	461.22	463.32	school eat or why sometimes I don't
We	WeylieHoang	463.32	465.51	understand words because the only way I
We	WeylieHoang	465.51	467.76	can express it is in Chinese and that
We	WeylieHoang	467.76	470.789	explains why I struggled so much in
We	WeylieHoang	470.789	472.83	English which brings me to my next story
We	WeylieHoang	472.83	474.09	I hope you guys aren't born these
We	WeylieHoang	474.09	476.01	stories yet but this is the last story I
We	WeylieHoang	476.01	478.86	want to tell and that is me struggling a
We	WeylieHoang	478.86	479.789	lot as a kid
We	WeylieHoang	479.789	482.52	in English so I remember kids would read
We	WeylieHoang	482.52	483.99	books and like we had to take these
We	WeylieHoang	483.99	485.76	tests at the end of like each book that
We	WeylieHoang	485.76	487.38	we read just to see how much we absorb
We	WeylieHoang	487.38	489.81	the material and I remember I would fail
We	WeylieHoang	489.81	492.66	every single test even though I read the
We	WeylieHoang	492.66	494.19	book or at least I thought I read the
We	WeylieHoang	494.19	496.47	book reading was a really really hard
We	WeylieHoang	496.47	498.45	thing because I was learning English at
We	WeylieHoang	498.45	500.1	school but the second I got home I'm
We	WeylieHoang	500.1	501.6	speaking Chinese with my family
We	WeylieHoang	501.6	503.07	throughout elementary school throughout
We	WeylieHoang	503.07	505.35	middle school I struggled so hard I can
We	WeylieHoang	505.35	507.81	never pass those reading tests I was
We	WeylieHoang	507.81	511.05	testing two to three grades below what I
We	WeylieHoang	511.05	512.61	was supposed to be say I was in fifth
We	WeylieHoang	512.61	514.289	grade I was at a reading level of a
We	WeylieHoang	514.289	516.0	second third grader after my parents
We	WeylieHoang	516.0	518.4	knowing that I was testing so low in my
We	WeylieHoang	518.4	520.62	reading or my English test instead of
We	WeylieHoang	520.62	522.45	trying to understand why I was testing
We	WeylieHoang	522.45	525.06	that way my mom immediately just got mad
We	WeylieHoang	525.06	526.83	at me and was like you watched too much
We	WeylieHoang	526.83	529.23	TV why don't you study more you're born
We	WeylieHoang	529.23	530.14	and raised in America
We	WeylieHoang	530.14	531.97	how do you not know English and if you
We	WeylieHoang	531.97	534.46	ask me that was pretty shitty to be told
We	WeylieHoang	534.46	536.65	as a kid because I don't know like I
We	WeylieHoang	536.65	538.36	don't know why I suck at this it's like
We	WeylieHoang	538.36	540.58	I'm trying [ __ ] I'm trying like I'm
We	WeylieHoang	540.58	542.5	trying to read these goddamned books but
We	WeylieHoang	542.5	544.33	I can't understand it it's just it's
We	WeylieHoang	544.33	546.19	just so confusing for me and I think any
We	WeylieHoang	546.19	548.71	kid growing up in a bilingual family can
We	WeylieHoang	548.71	550.6	relate like for real I was struggling
We	WeylieHoang	550.6	552.28	because there were all these kids in
We	WeylieHoang	552.28	554.5	class reading Harry Potter and Harry
We	WeylieHoang	554.5	556.9	Potter is a big book y'all like it is
We	WeylieHoang	556.9	559.6	this thick okay while everybody was on
We	WeylieHoang	559.6	561.1	there Harry Potter I was still on my
We	WeylieHoang	561.1	563.65	Junie P Jones okay so those were the few
We	WeylieHoang	563.65	564.94	stories I wanted to share with you guys
We	WeylieHoang	564.94	567.31	sorry if I bored you those were the
We	WeylieHoang	567.31	569.35	moments for me growing up that impacted
We	WeylieHoang	569.35	571.45	me so much and with that being said I
We	WeylieHoang	571.45	574.48	want to talk about how I have learned to
We	WeylieHoang	574.48	576.64	be proud of being chinese-american and
We	WeylieHoang	576.64	578.77	being different and the way that I have
We	WeylieHoang	578.77	580.78	coped with it is that I told myself
We	WeylieHoang	580.78	583.06	there's nothing to be embarrassed about
We	WeylieHoang	583.06	585.31	like what is wrong with being a minority
We	WeylieHoang	585.31	587.92	what is wrong with being different what
We	WeylieHoang	587.92	589.57	is wrong with speaking a different
We	WeylieHoang	589.57	591.73	language outside of English I asked
We	WeylieHoang	591.73	592.21	myself
We	WeylieHoang	592.21	594.22	shouldn't I be proud that I know two
We	WeylieHoang	594.22	596.2	languages shouldn't I be proud that I
We	WeylieHoang	596.2	598.36	know two different cultures and what is
We	WeylieHoang	598.36	600.67	wrong with mine whether a person speaks
We	WeylieHoang	600.67	602.23	another language eats a different type
We	WeylieHoang	602.23	605.02	of food or not we are all people like
We	WeylieHoang	605.02	606.34	when it comes down to it we're all
We	WeylieHoang	606.34	608.53	people we're all just people trying to
We	WeylieHoang	608.53	610.72	make it in this world and shouldn't we
We	WeylieHoang	610.72	612.97	bring our differences together and share
We	WeylieHoang	612.97	614.8	that with each other and learn from each
We	WeylieHoang	614.8	616.3	other just take a second and imagine
We	WeylieHoang	616.3	619.72	what if everyone in this world were
We	WeylieHoang	619.72	622.03	American and we all ate the same thing
We	WeylieHoang	622.03	624.16	we all spoke the same language and there
We	WeylieHoang	624.16	626.44	was nothing else beyond that what if we
We	WeylieHoang	626.44	627.97	were all the same with the same exact
We	WeylieHoang	627.97	629.89	value spoke the same language ate the
We	WeylieHoang	629.89	631.78	same food then there won't be much to
We	WeylieHoang	631.78	633.4	share it wasn't until like the end of
We	WeylieHoang	633.4	635.2	high school where I realized I wanted to
We	WeylieHoang	635.2	637.24	embrace being Chinese it helped me
We	WeylieHoang	637.24	639.58	tremendously when I started surrounding
We	WeylieHoang	639.58	641.11	myself with people who wanted me to
We	WeylieHoang	641.11	643.33	embrace that side of me and that is one
We	WeylieHoang	643.33	644.68	of my biggest advice to you guys
We	WeylieHoang	644.68	646.51	surround yourself with people who
We	WeylieHoang	646.51	649.18	genuinely are curious about you want to
We	WeylieHoang	649.18	651.58	know about you and respect you because
We	WeylieHoang	651.58	653.08	if you surround yourself with people who
We	WeylieHoang	653.08	655.0	are just gonna make fun of you make you
We	WeylieHoang	655.0	657.22	feel ashamed of who you are that's what
We	WeylieHoang	657.22	659.5	you're gonna be so girl if you're around
We	WeylieHoang	659.5	661.0	people that want to
We	WeylieHoang	661.0	662.62	I thought your language want to laugh of
We	WeylieHoang	662.62	665.38	what you eat laugh of what you wear you
We	WeylieHoang	665.38	667.69	are putting yourself in the wrong place
We	WeylieHoang	667.69	669.25	and by the way as many of you guys know
We	WeylieHoang	669.25	671.92	WOM my boyfriend he's Chinese as well
We	WeylieHoang	671.92	674.53	and dating him was not like a plan thing
We	WeylieHoang	674.53	676.48	I did it like date him because oh my god
We	WeylieHoang	676.48	678.07	he's Chinese I want to be with a Chinese
We	WeylieHoang	678.07	679.78	guy it just so happened to be that he
We	WeylieHoang	679.78	682.09	was Chinese and he is someone that
We	WeylieHoang	682.09	685.45	embraces being Chinese so so much he was
We	WeylieHoang	685.45	686.26	a type of kid
We	WeylieHoang	686.26	688.06	to bring a ham using your pen to school
We	WeylieHoang	688.06	690.31	okay like if you bring ham you take no
We	WeylieHoang	690.31	692.56	pen to school you don't [ __ ] play you
We	WeylieHoang	692.56	695.29	are embracing the most Chinese side of
We	WeylieHoang	695.29	697.48	you if you bring a ham using your pen to
We	WeylieHoang	697.48	700.51	school or to work okay I'm using a pen
We	WeylieHoang	700.51	702.61	is basically a steamed dish with salted
We	WeylieHoang	702.61	705.73	fish and pork it's like a pancake it's
We	WeylieHoang	705.73	708.1	like a meat pancake but the salty fish
We	WeylieHoang	708.1	711.16	oh my god it smells so so strong like if
We	WeylieHoang	711.16	713.59	I microwaved a hob using a bang in my
We	WeylieHoang	713.59	714.22	house right now
We	WeylieHoang	714.22	715.87	you would smell it throughout my entire
We	WeylieHoang	715.87	717.58	apartment okay and while was this type
We	WeylieHoang	717.58	719.41	of guy growing up where he was so proud
We	WeylieHoang	719.41	721.48	of who he was he had no shame in it and
We	WeylieHoang	721.48	723.97	ever since dating him he has really
We	WeylieHoang	723.97	726.01	drilled that into me so like I said
We	WeylieHoang	726.01	728.589	earlier the biggest advice I can give to
We	WeylieHoang	728.589	730.3	you if you're dealing with just some
We	WeylieHoang	730.3	733.089	sort of embarrassment or shame about you
We	WeylieHoang	733.089	734.83	having a different ethnic background
We	WeylieHoang	734.83	737.08	please surround yourself with people who
We	WeylieHoang	737.08	740.56	genuinely want you to thrive and instead
We	WeylieHoang	740.56	741.97	of seeing your differences of something
We	WeylieHoang	741.97	744.46	embarrassing see it as something I can
We	WeylieHoang	744.46	746.05	bring to the table like let me tell
We	WeylieHoang	746.05	748.3	y'all about my pork belly let me tell
We	WeylieHoang	748.3	750.58	y'all about my salted fish and if after
We	WeylieHoang	750.58	752.14	you tell people what you like to eat or
We	WeylieHoang	752.14	753.61	how you grew up and they want to be
We	WeylieHoang	753.61	755.89	disgusted it turned off or whatever
We	WeylieHoang	755.89	756.4	about it
We	WeylieHoang	756.4	758.53	let them be like let them be
We	WeylieHoang	758.53	760.54	closed-minded don't ever close yourself
We	WeylieHoang	760.54	762.67	off and think that you shouldn't share
We	WeylieHoang	762.67	764.5	your differences because that is what
We	WeylieHoang	764.5	766.48	makes this world so beautiful all of our
We	WeylieHoang	766.48	768.52	differences coming together as one and
We	WeylieHoang	768.52	770.11	people learning about each other I know
We	WeylieHoang	770.11	772.15	music plays a huge role in many people's
We	WeylieHoang	772.15	774.339	lives and for me growing up I didn't
We	WeylieHoang	774.339	775.9	know who I sure was
We	WeylieHoang	775.9	779.32	neo Beyonce Pussycat Dolls like those
We	WeylieHoang	779.32	780.49	were the artists that you know when I
We	WeylieHoang	780.49	781.69	was growing up those were the artists
We	WeylieHoang	781.69	783.46	that were like poppin you know and I
We	WeylieHoang	783.46	784.69	remember going to school and all these
We	WeylieHoang	784.69	786.22	girls would have sure on their binder
We	WeylieHoang	786.22	787.75	and they're like oh my god this is Asher
We	WeylieHoang	787.75	789.28	and I'm just like who dad because the
We	WeylieHoang	789.28	792.13	only artists that I know is twins boys
We	WeylieHoang	792.13	793.75	chang-geun Haley
We	WeylieHoang	793.75	796.09	Hakan young Joey tan while on like those
We	WeylieHoang	796.09	798.25	are the only hardest that I listen to
We	WeylieHoang	798.25	799.54	and those are the only artists that I
We	WeylieHoang	799.54	801.25	knew and because I wanted to fit in I
We	WeylieHoang	801.25	803.17	started to listen to the music that
We	WeylieHoang	803.17	804.61	other kids were listening to and it
We	WeylieHoang	804.61	806.47	wasn't that I didn't like it but my
We	WeylieHoang	806.47	808.18	heart was with Chinese music because
We	WeylieHoang	808.18	809.53	that is what I grew up with that is what
We	WeylieHoang	809.53	811.36	I know and that's what I like and for
We	WeylieHoang	811.36	813.28	years I would download songs into my
We	WeylieHoang	813.28	816.16	ipod that I personally did not really
We	WeylieHoang	816.16	818.71	enjoy listening to just so that in case
We	WeylieHoang	818.71	820.75	another kid from my class wanted to
We	WeylieHoang	820.75	824.26	listen to my music they'd be like oh
We	WeylieHoang	824.26	825.73	stuff and I just remember feeling like
We	WeylieHoang	825.73	827.98	this is not me this is not what I want
We	WeylieHoang	827.98	829.99	to listen to nowadays if you guys pick
We	WeylieHoang	829.99	831.76	up my phone you go to my music all I
We	WeylieHoang	831.76	833.98	have is Chinese music the only way I
We	WeylieHoang	833.98	835.99	know of new American songs coming out is
We	WeylieHoang	835.99	837.79	through my friends and wah and I mean I
We	WeylieHoang	837.79	839.77	still enjoy listening to it but for me
We	WeylieHoang	839.77	842.62	the music that really inspires me or
We	WeylieHoang	842.62	844.3	music that really connects with me is
We	WeylieHoang	844.3	846.31	Chinese music and I have no shame in it
We	WeylieHoang	846.31	848.08	I would be blasting that [ __ ] girl I'm
We	WeylieHoang	848.08	849.82	like driving with my windows down I'm
We	WeylieHoang	849.82	851.86	like blasting my Chinese music and yes
We	WeylieHoang	851.86	853.51	people next to me will probably be like
We	WeylieHoang	853.51	854.95	what the [ __ ] is she listening to like
We	WeylieHoang	854.95	856.54	that's not cool like what is that it
We	WeylieHoang	856.54	858.1	sounds so weird but I'm just like hey

We	WeylieHoang	875.589	877.39	like you don't really know how to apply
We	WeylieHoang	877.39	878.98	these things into your life because it
We	WeylieHoang	878.98	881.38	is hard you know it is hard to embrace
