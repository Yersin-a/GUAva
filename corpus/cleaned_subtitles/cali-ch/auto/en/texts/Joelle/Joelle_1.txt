what's up you guys it's Joelle and welcome back to my channel today I'm starting a new series on my channel that I want to start for quite a while I'm going to be calling it the best life and this was inspired by Amy vagabonds the am with Amy where it's basically like a get ready with me kind of situation but she also just talks he talks about things that she's interested in and stuff that she's been thinking about lately and can address topics that you guys requested and stuff like that so I wanted a format where I could combine my love for beauty and makeup and all of that with just the deeper things because for all of you makeup lovers I know that there is a lot of multidimensionality behind what goes on on your face so I just wanted to provide a space for that here on YouTube since I feel like a lot of times you know beauty gurus can kind of get relegated to only doing you know beauty cuz of course that's what they're good at but I personally love hearing about what people are thinking about and just what's going on between their ears behind all of the stuff that is just seen on camera the turtle of this series the best life is inspired by a verse out of proverbs three that I love it's how verses three to flourish and from the passion translation it reads let your life be shaped by integrity with truth written upon your heart that's how you'll find favor and understanding us both God and men and you will gain the reputation of living life well and personally that is something that I would love is to be known for living life well and so a lot of the topics that I'm going to be discussing in this series are just you know the everyday topics of being a human on this planet and figuring out how to live our best lives so for my first episode I decided to really pay tribute to Amy and do her Asian American tag which she started this past spring I want to say as so I'm gonna be answering her questions as they get ready and I'll have people tagged down below but if you make youtube videos and are interested in doing this tag I invite anyone watching to answer the questions as well starting with my face I actually already put on sunscreen and BB cream and moisturizer today so I'm just gonna get on into eyes I'm gonna be putting on my NYX shadow base to get started and her first question is what ethnicity are you and I am Chinese Korean American my mom is Chinese my dad is Korean for eyeshadow I'm getting into my Too Faced just peachy mattes palette that my sister mica got me thank you very much mica and this is gonna be your just a really summery everyday peachy look so I'm using peach tea I'm gonna use that all over my lid and the next question is what generation are you and I am technically second-generation my dad moved to the States from Seoul Korea when he was six but since he grew up in the States he's considered like first generation American I believe I don't Christ me on that if I'm wrong and my mom is also first generation because she was born in the States because her parents moved here from China when they were around college-aged next I'm gonna get into peach punch and I'm gonna put this on the outer half of my lids okay question number three is what is the first experience where you felt the demarcation of being a minority or different and I would say I knew all along that I was considered a minority because my parents would mention it when they talked about why we settled down in San Francisco is that my mom wanted us to grow up in a place where we wouldn't really have to experience as much racism growing up I think I really felt it regarding to my like specifically regarding to my race in high school I went to the same elementary school from like second grade to eighth grade but when I went to high school I was when I was you know kind of cognizant enough and I was gonna be around new people and my sister had already begun at that high school and she was telling you about like the social groups and how there was like how people would self separate segregate and there is like a group of the cool cool Asians and then the nerdy Asians literally like Mean Girls and I was like well how do I get to be with like the cool Asians like what's the difference between being a cool Asian a nerdy Asian like I don't really know what that means and she's like well like the nerdy is like kind of quiet they're like pretty book smart and just keep to themselves and with that I did super self-conscious as I began to say that high school because I was like oh no people are just gonna take one look at me and IRA me like she's a nerdy Asian cuz I was a nerdy I was very nerdy in middle school and I just felt like people are going to pinpoint me from the very beginning as being super quiet and never give me the chance to become one of their friends I choose this moment rather than you know that moment in middle school when someone makes fun of my lunch or something because I honestly don't think I really put it together that it was because my food was different or like I was minority than they were laughing I was just like well that's weird you don't like good food but like whatever but I think it's because I was so lucky to grow up in such a diverse place was that I was with a lot like I literally went to middle school in downtown Chinatown of San Francisco so like sure people could be rude and be like oh my gosh Oh like what is that it was literally mon Dieu or pot stickers you can buy them at Costco like come on I literally saw as their problem not mine and I was like okay I'm sorry like I'll try to make it smell less but I'm still gonna eat it cuz like you live in San Francisco how can you like how can you be like this oh yeah I mean just to follow up with like the high school thing thankfully after I got to high school I was like super extra brewed I was like the most talkative like funny silly bubbly person I tried I could possibly D so that people win it immediately pinpoint me as like a quiet Asian and like in a weird sad way to be honest it worked like people likes me they didn't see me and like delegate me to the group of like quiet Asian girls but I realized later on that I was like why I being like this like it I of course like I wanted to be close with everyone and I wanted to be friendly but I realized was coming out of a place of insecurity of being you know stereotyped incorrectly rather than just being my like true authentic self and then throughout the rest of high school from like junior to senior year I was like you know I'm gonna be friendly but I can just be myself and relax I don't need to feel like I'm compensating so in a weird way I wasn't changing so much what I was doing but it was coming from a different motivation of being authentic and being a good person rather than trying to make people see me a certain way and it was so much healthier and I was so much less exhausted and yeah I was so thankful that it came to that like revelation Oh another thing that I would do in high school though was that I would constant like right starting freshman year oh no super insecure was that I would always make Asian jokes about myself before something else could like I would assume that if I was talking about my grades or that I play piano I'd be like oh yeah you know cuz I'm Asian so like we just do that and it wasn't till one of my friends who's half Chinese pointed out and he was like Joe well like why do you always point it's being Asian like you know people aren't always gonna assume that you're doing these things cuz you're Asian and it really took him calling me out to be like oh wow like I'm internalizing it like this is internalized racism like I am so afraid of someone making fun of me that I feel the need to make fun of myself and call myself out for being Asian as if it's a bad thing so they don't have to do it first and after that I was like I need to stop and that was really good wake-up call so if you ever see this love you dude thank you so I put the pink on my lower lash line upper lash line and I think when you say I take peach sangria and use a little bit of it to deepen up the outer corner but next question is were you always proud of your heritage or was there a time where you rejected it and I would say at that time in high school when I felt like I am a classic model minority which is a myth for anyone who hasn't seen Amy's video on this go watch it until one about the model minority myth I felt like I needed to compensate for me being Asian even though I shouldn't have seen it as a weakness I did and I was super unhealthy and I didn't necessarily want to reject it I would still do what I was naturally going to do but I felt like I had to be okay with like taking a hit for it almost like socially that people look down on me when really I shouldn't have expected that that's just not the reality that we should live with and internalized course number five what are some stereotypes you struggle with I would say that I struggle a lot less now with stereotypes I think one thing I do still kind of struggle with is like being compared with other Asian girls like I think going to a predominantly white college it's really easy for like Asian girls to be you know kind of next to each other especially if they have similar interests and whatnot and just being like okay who's like the superior asian girl or who's the prettier asian girl and I definitely struggle with that especially in my sophomore year where I felt like after rushing and enjoying a sorority like I felt like that was you know Augmented just me being compared to other Asian girls because there was like some sort of quota that Greek houses were trying to fit because Greek houses can be racist but I think I've gotten over that a lot first after taking a gap year what you can hear all about my gap year vlogs so this is really messy as you can tell but I'm gonna blend it out with blending brush and that makes everything better but going back to the stereotype thing when I was younger I definitely struggled with being like the goody two-shoes a lot and I felt really self-conscious in like middle school that like I know I was just so nerdy and I did everything right and I felt like it was a bad thing I felt like people were gonna call me out for because I was Asian and instead of giving me credit for it and being like wow that's really impressive that you can like play piano and you get good grades and all of that they just be like well it's just cuz you're Asian and I was so annoyed that I was not getting credit for hard work because it was being just thrown on my race and that actually connects to the model minority myth that Asians are you know somehow genetically good at things and it really discredits a lot of Asians for what they've done and what they've contributed to society and also is really good at causing division between minorities when there should not be any and it's really good for causing division between Asians when they feel like they don't fit into the model minority myth and I feel like they failed in some way next I'm gonna take a little bit of peaches and cream and just throw that on the center of my lids and next to line my eyes I'm gonna use milk makeups shadow liner in the shade BP just a brown color question number six is can you speak your language so for me that would be Chinese or Cantonese and Korean I cannot unfortunately which is something that I'm really sad about but I've been trying to learn Korean last year a little bit I went on a missions trip to Korea and I picked up some words and I can kind of like read a little bit in Hangul but I'm really bad at it but my boyfriend's Korean and he helps me out try to learn a few words question number seven is husby engaging American affected your relationship with your parents and I think it definitely affected a little more when I was younger my mom wasn't a create like a legit tiger mom but she was a little tiger mom ish you know definitely whipped us into shape but I was honestly very thankful for it like I said I was a goody two-shoes kid my parents are both first generation and grew up in the States and can speak perfect English and I'm really thankful for that that we never had communication issues but definitely you know generational values that they grew up with or a lot harsher and more strict than what we see as Americans we were just like no other family or no other kids have to follow these kinds of rules like doing the next year's math over the summer before the school year or just strictness and how we had to dress and stuff like that but at the same time I think I was really I'm really thankful that I saw the value and everything my parents did and wanted us to do and also my my family is very strongly Christian and I think that really helped interestingly my parents got less strict as they became more Christian because the stuff that they wanted us to focus on became very different so rather than being so concerned about math and reading and scores and stuff they're like okay we want you to be happy we want you to grow up we want you to grow up loving God and knowing your identity and knowing that you're valued so we're gonna focus on that and that was honestly so so helpful for my relationship with my parents and I'm so thankful for it on the other hand going up Asian American has definitely made my relationship with my grandparents and extended family very interesting especially my grandparents just like a lot of different values I know there's a lot of racism also in especially in Korean culture I know that's obviously not true of all Koreans but it's just like a thing there's a lot of pride in like your nationality which is awesome but also it can result in like discrimination against people who are not Korean so I a half chinese half Korean family that obviously can cause some issues as you can imagine my trip to Korea was honestly so like super healing of that and I feel like God just like did a lot my heart that trip to like give me empathy and show where their time from and also show that it's like something that like they grew up with just historically through Wars through whatever and it's also got a lot better where they don't openly show as much discrimination towards Chinese people so oh that's good course number eight is how do you feel about your heritage now do you identify with it and I would say I've definitely throughout college high school and college going to be a lot more vocal about like my Asian pride I guess I've learned a lot more about specifically what it means to be Chinese or Korean American through friends and through just life education and growing up and realizing that it's something so valuable to hold on to I also feel like my relationship with God has also helped me to really just acknowledge the fact that I was made intentionally like me being half chinese half Korean was by God's design and that I should look for the strengths and that which to me is I have the opportunity to help represent and help elevate people of color and other Asian American girls help push the Asian American representation forward through media through education and whatever and though it can definitely be seen as like a burden I'm like you know what like if that is what something God's called me to I'm gonna take it and run with it sorry I totally just stop saying yes what I'm doing but next I'm gonna contour with my Too Faced cocoa contour palette and Amy's last question number nine is what is your favorite thing about being Asian American slash your heritage I would say I love that I feel like I have something to bring to the table I love that I have a family with a history and I love the values of Asian culture of working hard and those are things that are kind of often lost in Western culture I love the art and aesthetics of Asian culture both Chinese and Korean I love the food both Chinese and Korean I don't know I feel like it gives me something about myself that provides community in a really full way just you know uniting with other asian-americans and also just something to protect as I get older since America is this amazing wonderful melting pot of cultures but there's also like the integrity of it that I've started to learn the value of as we become a culture of like you know the mixing pot and whatever that it's really important to see the distinction and hold on to the history of what it means to be Korean American or Chinese American and I'm actually gonna answer one bonus question because I get this question a lot and that is do you feel more Chinese or more Korean having grown up as you know a mixed Chinese korean-american as I'm putting on this blush from was this from the faceshop it's just a really peachy blush Dee with her peachy makeup look and I actually personally so I grew up in San Francisco go there's a huge huge tiniest population and so I grew up with a lot more Chinese culture I was also largely raised by my mom who was Chinese my dad worked a lot and I sought to say that he wasn't present in my life but like the value systems and like the ways of thinking the food that my mom prepared was largely Chinese so I feel like I grew up with a lot of Chinese influence not even realizing it just cuz it was so normal like we would go to the Chinese grocery store and we would make wontons together and you know stuff like that you know we got Chinese New Year off for school because it was such a big there's such a big Chinese population also highlighting with a face job highlighter but as I've gone to college I've gotten to get to know a lot more Koreans and learn what it even means to be korean-american I literally didn't grow up around any Korean Americans until college like high school there was one of the Korean Roland and we never went to a Korean Church what we did but I was like an infant so it's been really cool getting to know what it means to be Korean I would say it's really hard like I don't ever want to choose one and say that like oh I feel more Korean or more Chinese and just kind of ignore the other one but I would say they came into my lives at very different points in time just because of the environment I was in and the people I was around but I would say they're both equally valuable to me and you know my parents are both equally valuable to me and different influences on me personality wise and culturally are both really important and play I think equally heavy roles so I'd say I'm pretty even split as boring of an answer as that is a whoops I forgot my lip color oh my gosh okay I'm just using siren by Revlon okay I first discovered this lipstick because Jenin talked about it when she was like a college student so thanks Jen okay now here is the final look that I'm sporting today
