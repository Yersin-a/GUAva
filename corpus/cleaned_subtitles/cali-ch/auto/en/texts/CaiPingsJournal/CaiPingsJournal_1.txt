what's up hi okay I just need to jump in and do this video because I keep like thinking about it and if I keep like thinking about it as much as I have then I'm just gonna like stress myself out even more where do I begin this video can like have come at a better time like the idea of it because Malaysia's elections happened super recently it is May so it's Asian Pacific American Heritage Month I knew it was four words long and finally oh I'm doing a new show this weekend with so my asian-american friends so that's he really couldn't have come at a perfect time I saw that genom had uploaded a video what it's like growing up Korean American last week and I kept meaning to watch it and as I was working out yesterday as I was on the treadmill I watched it I was like well I need to do one of these videos I try to YouTube Malaysian American I purposely left out growing up because I just wanted to cast the net wide uhm and so far Lee found like one or two other Malaysian American youtubers one is the Malay American guy and he addresses himself as the American male guy or the Malay American guy his channel will be right here and then we have Steven Lim from BuzzFeed I found out that he was like what Malaysian Chinese like a few weeks ago I was watching worth it and there was an episode where he had breakfast somewhere I think and then he thought it would be like something that his mom would make so he called his mom in the car and I heard her speak English and I was just like wait a second because you just like know like this and Corian and Malaysian accent it sounds like super similar so I just like quickly googled Steven Lim and turns out he is a Malaysian Chinese descent so that was pretty exciting for me so let's get into these questions I am a Malaysian by nationality and Chinese by race Malaysia is one of those countries where when you fill out a document they have a slot for nationality where you put like okay Malaysian and then they have a slot for race and then you put like well race deworm the main races in Malaysia arch Malay Chinese and Indian and my axe is gonna break like I talked about Malaysia of course like 99% of the time when I talk in English I have an American accent because I'm I don't know I just I spend most of my time here growing up 1% of the time if I'm talking about something that's like Malaysian my Malaysian accent will like come out a little bit some I guess minorities in Malaysia we have a solid Japanese community there are some Eurasians and we have we definitely have Caucasian people leaving leaving living in Malaysia my friends that are Caucasian that live in Malaysia are normally of some sort of like direct European New Zealand or Australian descent none of them I know are American and where I'm from in Malaysia is pinning Penang is one of the States and Malaysia it's made up of an island and some part of the state is on the mainland of Malaysia the island is off the west coast of Malaysia and from the island part and it's exactly what you think an island would be like it's very tropical there's jungle there's Beach but it's also one of the most urban places in Malaysia - so there's a lot of City and things that are being built up and changing especially since it got its UNESCO World Heritage recognition years ago a lot of things have been changing it's been getting a lot cleaner and honestly the cleanliness used to be part of the culture shock for me going back home because it would be so different like the cleanliness and the US versus in where I was in Malaysia what generation am i I'm the first generation I was born in Malaysia and I moved here when I was four years old I moved to the Bay Area in California when I was four I went to college in Massachusetts and and then now I'm down here in Southern California we moved in the beginning because of my dad's tech job we were supposed to stay here for about six months in the us six months became two years and it just it just kept going from there okay so I grew up in the Bay Area well it's in the US and Malaysia Penang itself is also Penang and the Bay Area are both really mixing pot like places they're quite diverse I never really felt that I was I I knew there were other people that looks like me basically but of course I felt that more when I went back to Malaysia Malaysia I didn't feel so special but I think you guys are asking for like oh like what experiences did you feel different we're like isolated you do remember few when I was younger and they're not gonna be as like nightmarish has some people get some people's experience I know are like like their mom's packed them like a certain lunch and they brought it to school and like their friends are just like wait what is that that's so gross and they get embarrassed by it but I was lucky enough not to go through that um I mean I sort of did in like fifth grade basically what happened was that I I brought a snack that had dried anchovies and peanuts which is a Gumby lace that was the terrible pronunciation ikan bilis it's a really good savory snack because it has like protein a lot of protein in it and keep see fall and it's tasty and we serve it as a side on some dishes this snack was from actually a Japanese market but it had traces of dried anchovy whole and roasted peanuts in it so I got really excited because when people especially if you're like a child of an immigrant or an immigrant yourself you eat a snack from your home country and you're not there it kind of like fills in a place like in your heart that like no other food can where you are but I brought to school and of course since it's like a dried whole fish that I'm enjoying I kind of knew that I would be made fun of so whenever I brought it out my friends would notice and that I would just be like I'm eating a whole fish like it's dried and it's gross but look here goes the head and I like eat the keep the head by itself and they're just being like you're so weird I think there was one person that like really called me out on it and shoot anyway he was like a South Asian descent I'm not gonna say Indian because I'm not sure and he was just like you know which eye he's eating fish like and this is like you know the first break you have in school if you go to public school in the US like you have that first morning break I was eating it then and she was like and it's like he's having eats fish in the morning like all dried in like Oh's house it's like yeah I do because it's good I think I felt more different actually going home going back to Malaysia we went back to Malaysia for about two months every single year growing up because um you know we still my family still has their house there and I remember once in the car I was with my one of my cousins so my cousins in Malaysia so much of public school where Malay is taught heavily and then some what's your international school which is sort of like private school there and a lot of international schools around the world especially it's a mostly American taught one of my cousins that went to public school and one of my cousin's that went to international school in the car with me in the back seat and they were just like the one so a lot of kids that go to international school sometimes don't know Malay as well as the ones that go to public school or like normal government school okay we were all talking about something and then my cousin goes the one that I went to international school she goes like she says a phrase in Malay and then my other cousin laughs about it and I'm just like wait what does that mean and then she goes like you don't know what that means and I'm just like no and she was like you how can you believe be Malaysian if you don't know what no no no means and I was just like um whoa it's it's a really hard thing to answer because like you it's something that you can't help yeah I was kind of awkward because you don't feel isolated every single day but they're just like some moments like that where you do but you don't feel Asian enough or Western enough in some situations and then there was like this time a hawker stall hawker stalls are basically like are like food carts and they all gather in like a market and it's great but anyway I was trying to order something and when I order stuff in Malaysia or they use my different dialects of Chinese or I ordered it in English and I chose to order it in English this time and of course when I spoke English my American accent was very prevalent a person who was working it didn't understand me once and then I repeated it didn't understand me twice and then she's like oh my god there's something wall I was just like first of all I was born here I'm wanted it literally means American but it's sometimes used in a derogatory like form like this outsider and that I don't know it's just it feels kind of weird hearing that I like coming from like home home you know what I mean what people like referred to as home if you're if you're not just like a major Asian American people ask you oh like where are you really from and it's just like I associated both places with home to an extent when I was back in Malaysia for like the summers and stuff my cousins would introduce me to their friends and actually my grandma would actually introduce my whole family to or like her friends as like be like oh this is my cousin from America and I'll just be like um yes you kind of want to go back and be like I traveled like 27 hours to get back to where I came from like this is my I was born here oh this is my cousin from us and I'm just like okay well actually I was born here I have always said that I was born here and then I moved and then I come back every summer because that's exactly what happens because people say like in like a certain friend group here I feel like I'm the Asian I don't really get that feeling but when they go back to where their mother country is they'll be like oh I'm the American that I can really relate to people definitely when I was doing like my internships or whereas basically like socializing with my cousin's are their friends in Malaysia they would definitely see me as the American were you always proud of your heritage or was there a time you rejected it um I don't really remember a time where I like rejected my Malaysian açaí always grew up I think my mom always made sure that I knew I was I was born in Malaysia duh and came here when I was four and that Malaysian culture definitely like runs through my blood and even though I I feel mostly American I got really confused in college though because um I know a lot of my college friends are gonna watch this but like and it's not your fault College was a time when a lot of my friends from Malaysia their siblings would come to college with me because Emily Penang at least a very small island but is heavily populated and so you know people even when you go out like marketing or something or to the mall you'll know someone by like three degrees I once rented a car with my mom in Connecticut and the woman who rented it to us was Malaysian and we could tell us I mean guess where we were from because she could clearly tell from us too and she we were like oh we're from Malaysia and she was like oh we should part and we say oh we're from Penang and they just like I'm from Penang too and we knew we were gonna be related to somehow turns out that her mom goes to church and his friends of my grandma on my mother's side a lot of my friends like their family members who are my age started to come to college in the same area as me and we would hang out sometimes which was pretty cool but they would hang out a lot more with each other and I felt like I wasn't it was because they weren't inviting me to hang out with them because they couldn't connect to me on that Malaysian level like I wasn't Malaysian enough to be invited to hang out sometimes and he became a huge identity crisis because I was just like do I try to hang out with my Malaysian friends or do I hang out with like my American friends that I'm used to like for most of the time I spent growing up I got really worked up about it and I remember telling my Malaysian friend who was like the closest to me in college majoring if you're out there I I remember telling her that I didn't know what to do she was like the thing I thought all you like av season in many Asian Americans is that like you're both and you don't realize it I'm like yeah I do realize it I never fit in anywhere like completely and she's like well just realize that you have the best of both even though you won't really fit into one so I guess I guess that's what I'm stuck with there's some stereotypes that you struggle with the general Asian American stereotype that I struggle with is the stereotype that all Asians are supposed to be good at math and science honestly music art in English from in languages where my strongest subjects school and I had to work twice as hard in math and science to just keep up with everybody else I remember I really remember in kindergarten like everyone would be out at recess and I would still be working on 2+2 just trying to figure out why does 2+2 make for and I remember I would always be let out to recess late because I would always be stuck on math problems but reading came really easy to me and so did spelling I just hear it in my head and see the words and because I spent so much of my time studying for math and science just to make you know like what sometimes I didn't even make the grades I wanted and I would like study like twice as hard as my friends my friends would always see me studying like my classmates would always see me studying and they'd be like if you think I would be like super smart or something and I remember one of my friends in bio we were in the back and we were taking an exam who's like do you want to do you want to cheat and I was it's like not really it was like but you're like super smart you're like always like studying and you must you must know what to do I'm just like no I'm studying because I suck at this I'm stereotype really like that's the one that really like affects me everyone thinks grades and Asian households are just like number one and yeah our parents my parents that really do set that bar really high if I got something that I didn't wanted I would just take it so badly and I still do that sometimes like I would get like a mark that I didn't want and I'd be like oh even though I worked so hard for that mark and I'd be like it's still not this mark I still can't change myself to get this mark grades man grades kill us Asians like seriously the other stereotype that really gets me is a Malaysian stereotype and that is speaking several languages so Malaysians are really multilingual if we speak different languages too depending on who we're talking to I kind of really like learning languages and so I've picked up some language is the basics of some sometimes for like work or for fun and I would try to practice them speaking with people that are like around that speak that language like around here because this place is so diverse California is so diverse and they'd be like what are you doing like why are you speaking you try to speak Japanese to me cuz like because I just want to and you know it if you try to speak like different languages like in Malaysia like no one cares like they think they don't think like it's cool they don't think like you're trying to be like someone they don't think like you're Korea boo-boo-boo no they just think like she's just trying to speak different languages here if you speak like a different language or someone especially if that person is so like the same generation as you they're just like as me at least my generation they're just like what are you trying to do can you speak your language yes and no so Malaysia as I said is made up of like several different languages the national language is male and that I am the worst at I can I know phrases to get me by but I don't really know census how I learned how to count to four for example was the a local aquarium my favorite aquarium Monterey Bay Aquarium in California the Monterey Bay California had four waters for Southeast Asian river otters that were on loan I think from Singapore Zoo and their names were one two three & 4 in Malay so stock to do what you gonna but were their names people who I think people are like oh my gosh their names are so like foreign and like cool but it really just means one two three & four and that's how I learned how to say one two count to 4 Emily I speak Hakka hookean because of my parents because my dad speaks hookean which is very prevalent in Panay it's a Chinese dialect and so he mixes that in with English my mom speaks Hakka and she makes it that in with English it's to the point where she hasn't become comfortable with my friends hanging out at my house and she's just speaking in both languages to me and I'm just like mom they don't understand you you have to speak English only should just be like but I'm comfortable like this and I'm like okay never mind Mandarin Chinese that is probably my second strongest language and it's because my mom heavily insisted that my brother and I learn Mandarin in school to the point where she sent us to elementary school where about half of our classes were in Mandarin Chinese I would know I wouldn't say that I wouldn't understand it for because it's gonna sound really snobby to some people but my mom would sometimes use being monolingual as a threat to me and my brother she just really didn't want my brother nights missed out on being multilingual like people were in Malaysia like how kids were in Malaysia like how they would speak Chinese to each other in school and learn English in school and they would speak Malay to like someone outside she would be like oh you want to just speak you just want to speak English like all those kids out there you don't wanna you want to be multi you don't want to speak Chinese and like open more opportunities for yourself and I was just like no like because it's nice I would get hard it would get hard balancing math and Chinese and math in English I'm definitely really thankful though that I did learn Mandarin Chinese growing up because I used a dish every day like at work and trying to find more work for sure being multilingual definitely has inspired me to take on more languages and because when you try to learn more languages you kind of like build a bridge it's like connecting with more people and that's really fascinating me it has definitely had its pros and cons being asian-american and affecting my relationship with my parents the hard part is that as I said I'm stronger I was stronger like languages growing up and art growing up in school but I was interested in working with animals so the road to being interested in working with animals was very math and science heavy and that was really that's really hard for me but then I always knew that I had a creative side hence the YouTube I know I just got more into like making like videos and like being more crafty and so I'm currently trying to like chase that a bit I'm currently trying to be more involved in thumb and videos video making producing specifically if you meet a producer please hit me up anyway so that part has been hard because you know how the stereotype how easy Asian parents don't want like their kids picked chasing arts because it's unstable that stereotype is definitely true for me America is like the hub of entertainment of the world and some in some aspects so chasing the industry makes it hard on my Asian side but in a way being asian-american has definitely made me more connected with my parents to in a way that like will have like a family conversation back in Malaysia with some of my Malaysian like family members and they will have a perspective on how to solve a problem that I will have that that is very Western influence that my the Asian side of my family like would not be able to see and so that's sort of like what brought has brought me closer to my parents which is really unique and definitely I something I would not have seen coming when I was younger it's like they understand you yeah no my parents what's really funny is that my dad is very very very American to the point where he doesn't really like to associate with his Asian Asst but when he's pissed like when he's mad like all of that accent will drop like and he'll be like speaking his like hook down like mom though my mom really embraces her Asian side for sure she embraces her agents her like her eastern side I think like probably a bit more than her western side she definitely has a western side to her and I think that's a that's true for a lot of like immigrants like in their home countries because or children of immigrants because like you will identify with your like home country a bit like it differs per person to what extent they identify with it how do you feel about your heritage now do you identify with it I do identify with it how I feel about it now is pretty good especially after college I think yeah I think college is when I felt the worst about it I've accepted that I'm never gonna be truly home somewhere like I can't completely associate a place with home kind of learn to be to like represent the best of both have fun with the best of both worlds Hannah Montana reference right there instead of just feeling incomplete with both what's your favorite thing about being an Asian American or about your heritage I mean having the best of both cultures is always plus honestly the best part about being Asian American is just like being open to more cultures I think just like being able to connect with more people because there are similarities and differences between the Asian cultures just like being able to connect on some things that are common or being introduced to things that are different and sort of giving you a new perspective that's really cool also the food is bomb like I'm just gonna leave it there I like being a Malaysian because like I think I'm very lucky in that I'm part of a culture that is super diverse and open to new cultures honestly like if you listen to like the Malaysian like Spotify top 50 its Chinese pop western pop kpop in like there's some Bollywood and Malay songs in there and it's just like it's it's so much fun that diversity is pretty lit in Malaysia especially Malaysia's music makes me more like open to different music genres use it just opens more doors it's it's kind of crazy so that's it for the questions if you guys want to know like a little bit more about what Malaysians you like cuz we're pretty funny and easygoing um there's some awesome YouTube channels that are by Malaysians that are shot in Malaysia I mean they travel too sometimes but you know I think my favorite if you guys like skits my favorite Malaysian youtubers are jinny-boy TV dan KU productions and the main thing if you guys like you guys like Beauty crease crease ao is my favorite she also vlogs to her vlogs and really nice and her challenges are really funny and who else do I like ooh of vlogger so he doesn't walk he used to vlog daily and they were so awesome his vlogs were like his daily vlogs were lit very Casey nice dad um Sean Lee he is a beatboxer and who used a daily vlog and his videos are pretty cool so just a lot of Malaysians but apparently you not a lot of Malaysian Americans on the Internet okay so that is my what is this tag called I feel like this is the growing of like insert Asian country and then American tag like right here yeah and I guess I'll tag some channels to do this tag I just like really enjoyed like seeing different people's perspectives thank you so much for watching and like through this whole thing so yeah series in Ryan excellent bye there we go okay as I said I'm stronger I was stronger in English and math in English this took so long to film and I have water here but my voice is just like going Penang is a very mixing pot
