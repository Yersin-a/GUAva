hi everyone and welcome back to your girls Channel so today I have a topic that I've been wanting to talk about for years now and I don't know why I never really got around to talking about it a part of me feels like it's not something that people would be necessarily interested in but as I'm getting older more and more I find myself thinking about this almost on a daily basis and whether or not this is something that affects your life I hope that this is a video that you can pass on to people in your life that are probably dealing with the same thing because growing up for me this was something that was really hard and I didn't realize I played such a huge role in my life until my adulthood and the topic is about growing up as a chinese-american and obviously you do not have to be Chinese to be watching this video I'm just sharing with you guys my experience and how I grew up so just apply it in your own life and with that being said let's just jump right in and get started so I want to start off to give a little backstory in case you guys are new to my channel so when I was growing up my parents never really like told me oh Whaley you're Chinese or you're Asian believe it or not growing up I didn't even realize that there were other ethnic backgrounds in the world I thought we were all the same people I obviously noticed a difference between me and my classmates I would see that we have different hair colors different eye colors and we would speak a different language back at home but for some reason and never clicked to me because my parents never like drilled in my head like oh you're Asian or you're Chinese I just saw everyone as human beings and that may sound stupid to y'all but for real I did not know the difference growing up I just thought everyone was taught different things in their household but I didn't realize that meant that we came from a different like ethnic background so the first day of preschool rolled around and it was nothing like I expected it I grew up just speaking Cantonese Chinese whatever you want to call it in my family my family didn't see the need of teaching me English because they felt like well she's gonna learn it in school anyway so might as well teach her like her native tongue serve on my voice I'm like recovering from a cold so this voice is just all weird since I all right but going back to what I was saying my parents did not teach me a word of English I probably knew things like Apple I knew my name and that's pretty much about it I didn't know English at all going into preschool so I remember going to school looking at everyone it was like what are they saying eventually by the end of preschool I picked up on the lane and we went into kindergarten and I understood English just fine then third grade came around and third grade was about the time mark where I started feeling uncomfortable about being Chinese growing up in my family all we ate was Chinese food every meal consisted of rice so you each have your bowl of rice and then there's all the meats and veggies or whatever and we all share it hardly did I ever eat anything outside of Chinese food the only like taste of American food I would get would probably be like McDonald's or sometimes we would go to Denny's which is a diner sorry I think I said third grade earlier but I'm in second grade second grade is the first time I started feeling any sort of discrimination second grade not third grade in second grade I moved to a new school and I was super excited about it and I wanted to buy school lunches because I've always kind of like brought my own lunch and no one's ever really said anything about it I think it's because we were younger at the time in second grade I decided the first day of school mom I want to buy lunch at school I just wanted to try it so my parents gave me lunch money that day and when I went into the lunch line I remember looking at everything and I was just like how do you eat this after that day I went home and I was telling my mom like I don't really like the food like that's not what I want to eat so I think I'm just gonna go back to bringing my own food so my mom was like cool okay growing up something that my parents would always make like this was my favorite thing this was my dream I ate it almost every single day and it is pork belly with pickled mustard greens it's like a stew that you would make and it was just uh it was so so good anytime that my mom made sooner I caught you I would be like oh today is my lucky day so that night my mom made a big old pot of its unless she can pack me lunch for the next day and she put it in like this like thermal warmer thing it was like a it was like a cup like this there were layers on the top she put my rice and on the bottom she put the meat and I was so excited about lunch time okay girl like I knew that was in my lunch bag and like while I was in class I was like looking forward to lunch I'm like I cannot wait to eat this so by the time I get to lunch I'm like ready right I like bust out my food I'm like putting my rice down putting my meat down I got my chopsticks out I'm ready to eat and then all of a sudden all my classmates look at me and then they're like what is that smell and at first I thought they thought it smelled good cuz to me this was a I grew up with and this smells [ __ ] amazing if you ask me so I'm all like excited I'm like oh you want to know what I'm eating okay they all come over and they're all like hovering over and they're like what is that like what is that smell so I was like oh it's a pork belly with like pickled veggies it's a Chinese dish and then after I said pork belly I don't know if it's cuz in America you don't call bacon pork belly you call it bacon but it's really pork belly I don't know the second I said pork belly everyone freaked down they're like hey what are you eating why are you eating that that's so disgusting oh my god it smells so bad literally everyone just started talking about it and they made it seem like the most disgusting thing ever they all walked away and I remember just like my heart sunk I felt so embarrassed but I didn't even know what I was embarrassed about because I literally went from oh my god I'm so proud that I'm eating this and I'm having this - oh my god why did everyone freak out I don't understand I felt so so embarrassed like I didn't even know if I should even eat anymore at that point I was really hungry it smelled really good I wanted to eat it but because everyone looked at me as if it's so disgusting I felt like if I ate it that would mean I'm disgusting so I took a few bites and I just put it away and I pretended like I didn't even like it myself and I remember just feeling so disgusted with myself because I was lying to myself you know I wanted to fit in so I acted like something that I liked and something that I was so proud of what's disgusting to me so the next door I want to talk about is the day I found out I was Chinese okay it was a day in third grade where a new kid came to our school I believe he was Taiwanese so he spoke Mandarin and he had a really flat face which I hate to even say that but let's just be real like I have a really flat face and seriously can we talk about this without people getting offended I'm just gonna be real and just describe what I feel okay most Asian people do have more of a flatter profile and if you don't that's great I'm not saying all Asians do many of us don't have really prominent cheekbones we don't have deep set eyes I remember that's how a nice kid he had a really really flat face like even more flat than mine and all the kids in class were making fun of him and I overheard them and they're just like he has such a flat face like did he get slapped or something growing up grow I was someone that just listened to everybody else I never really had an opinion of my own like if that's what the majority is saying I'm gonna be like okay yeah you're right so there was a moment where those mean kids looked at me and they looked at me as if they were waiting for me to like jump in and say something too and me being the loser that I was I'm just like oh [ __ ] that's what they're saying like I need to agree with them because otherwise they would laugh at me so I say back to them like yeah he has such a flat face and then they all bursted out laughing looked at me and one of the guys were like so do you aren't you guys the same or something so that day after school I go home and I tell my mom and I'm like kids at school were making fun of me saying that I have a flat face like do I have a flat face I remember my mom saying like hey hold on let me sigh don't say Casey well they didn't go again then which in translation my mom was just like huh maybe it's just those kids making fun of us Asian people and I was just like what's the difference so my mom broke it down to me explained to me that you know we are different like we are minorities in this country and bla bla bla so on so forth and that for me explained so much about why I don't eat food that kids at school eat or why sometimes I don't understand words because the only way I can express it is in Chinese and that explains why I struggled so much in English which brings me to my next story I hope you guys aren't born these stories yet but this is the last story I want to tell and that is me struggling a lot as a kid in English so I remember kids would read books and like we had to take these tests at the end of like each book that we read just to see how much we absorb the material and I remember I would fail every single test even though I read the book or at least I thought I read the book reading was a really really hard thing because I was learning English at school but the second I got home I'm speaking Chinese with my family throughout elementary school throughout middle school I struggled so hard I can never pass those reading tests I was testing two to three grades below what I was supposed to be say I was in fifth grade I was at a reading level of a second third grader after my parents knowing that I was testing so low in my reading or my English test instead of trying to understand why I was testing that way my mom immediately just got mad at me and was like you watched too much TV why don't you study more you're born and raised in America how do you not know English and if you ask me that was pretty shitty to be told as a kid because I don't know like I don't know why I suck at this it's like I'm trying [ __ ] I'm trying like I'm trying to read these goddamned books but I can't understand it it's just it's just so confusing for me and I think any kid growing up in a bilingual family can relate like for real I was struggling because there were all these kids in class reading Harry Potter and Harry Potter is a big book y'all like it is this thick okay while everybody was on there Harry Potter I was still on my Junie P Jones okay so those were the few stories I wanted to share with you guys sorry if I bored you those were the moments for me growing up that impacted me so much and with that being said I want to talk about how I have learned to be proud of being chinese-american and being different and the way that I have coped with it is that I told myself there's nothing to be embarrassed about like what is wrong with being a minority what is wrong with being different what is wrong with speaking a different language outside of English I asked myself shouldn't I be proud that I know two languages shouldn't I be proud that I know two different cultures and what is wrong with mine whether a person speaks another language eats a different type of food or not we are all people like when it comes down to it we're all people we're all just people trying to make it in this world and shouldn't we bring our differences together and share that with each other and learn from each other just take a second and imagine what if everyone in this world were American and we all ate the same thing we all spoke the same language and there was nothing else beyond that what if we were all the same with the same exact value spoke the same language ate the same food then there won't be much to share it wasn't until like the end of high school where I realized I wanted to embrace being Chinese it helped me tremendously when I started surrounding myself with people who wanted me to embrace that side of me and that is one of my biggest advice to you guys surround yourself with people who genuinely are curious about you want to know about you and respect you because if you surround yourself with people who are just gonna make fun of you make you feel ashamed of who you are that's what you're gonna be so girl if you're around people that want to I thought your language want to laugh of what you eat laugh of what you wear you are putting yourself in the wrong place and by the way as many of you guys know WOM my boyfriend he's Chinese as well and dating him was not like a plan thing I did it like date him because oh my god he's Chinese I want to be with a Chinese guy it just so happened to be that he was Chinese and he is someone that embraces being Chinese so so much he was a type of kid to bring a ham using your pen to school okay like if you bring ham you take no pen to school you don't [ __ ] play you are embracing the most Chinese side of you if you bring a ham using your pen to school or to work okay I'm using a pen is basically a steamed dish with salted fish and pork it's like a pancake it's like a meat pancake but the salty fish oh my god it smells so so strong like if I microwaved a hob using a bang in my house right now you would smell it throughout my entire apartment okay and while was this type of guy growing up where he was so proud of who he was he had no shame in it and ever since dating him he has really drilled that into me so like I said earlier the biggest advice I can give to you if you're dealing with just some sort of embarrassment or shame about you having a different ethnic background please surround yourself with people who genuinely want you to thrive and instead of seeing your differences of something embarrassing see it as something I can bring to the table like let me tell y'all about my pork belly let me tell y'all about my salted fish and if after you tell people what you like to eat or how you grew up and they want to be disgusted it turned off or whatever about it let them be like let them be closed-minded don't ever close yourself off and think that you shouldn't share your differences because that is what makes this world so beautiful all of our differences coming together as one and people learning about each other I know music plays a huge role in many people's lives and for me growing up I didn't know who I sure was neo Beyonce Pussycat Dolls like those were the artists that you know when I was growing up those were the artists that were like poppin you know and I remember going to school and all these girls would have sure on their binder and they're like oh my god this is Asher and I'm just like who dad because the only artists that I know is twins boys chang-geun Haley Hakan young Joey tan while on like those are the only hardest that I listen to and those are the only artists that I knew and because I wanted to fit in I started to listen to the music that other kids were listening to and it wasn't that I didn't like it but my heart was with Chinese music because that is what I grew up with that is what I know and that's what I like and for years I would download songs into my ipod that I personally did not really enjoy listening to just so that in case another kid from my class wanted to listen to my music they'd be like oh stuff and I just remember feeling like this is not me this is not what I want to listen to nowadays if you guys pick up my phone you go to my music all I have is Chinese music the only way I know of new American songs coming out is through my friends and wah and I mean I still enjoy listening to it but for me the music that really inspires me or music that really connects with me is Chinese music and I have no shame in it I would be blasting that [ __ ] girl I'm like driving with my windows down I'm like blasting my Chinese music and yes people next to me will probably be like what the [ __ ] is she listening to like that's not cool like what is that it sounds so weird but I'm just like hey you listen to your music I listen to mine this is what I like to listen to and I'm a jam out to it right this video is getting really long as always every time we do girl talk we talk forever okay I think I got most of the things that I wanted to talk about out and maybe after watching this video you're still feeling a little iffy and you feel like you don't really know how to apply these things into your life because it is hard you know it is hard to embrace something that's so different to people who aren't used to it and you feel embarrassed you feel judged but the most important thing is you got to surround yourself with people who genuinely care and respect you and you yourself you are the first person that needs to accept and feel proud of who you are because you can't look for that validation and other people you got to feel it in your heart girl that upbringing of yours is what molded you to be the person you are today and you have so much to offer I hope this video meant something to you I hope that it changed your way of thinking a little bit and I hope that is taking you one step closer to accepting who you are thank you guys so much for watching and tuning in to my channel and I will see you guys in my next one bye
