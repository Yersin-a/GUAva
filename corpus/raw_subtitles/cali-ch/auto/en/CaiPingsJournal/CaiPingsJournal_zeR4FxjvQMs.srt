00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:22,740
can like have come at a better time like

8
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,480
the idea of it because Malaysia's

elections happened super recently it is

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:31,740

12
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:38,129
long and finally oh I'm doing a new show

00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:43,379
friends so that's he really couldn't

15
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:45,899
have come at a perfect time I saw that

16
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:48,329
genom had uploaded a video what it's

17
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:51,180
like growing up Korean American last

18
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:52,860
week and I kept meaning to watch it and

19
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,390
as I was working out yesterday as I was

20
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,780
on the treadmill I watched it I was like

21
00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:01,739
well I need to do one of these videos I

22
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:03,780
try to YouTube Malaysian American I

23
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:06,740
purposely left out growing up because I

24
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:10,799
just wanted to cast the net wide uhm and

25
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:12,900
so far Lee found like one or two other

26
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,340
Malaysian American youtubers one is the

27
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,850
Malay American guy and he addresses

28
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,860
himself as the American male guy or the

29
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,320
Malay American guy his channel will be

30
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:25,290
right here and then we have Steven Lim

31
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,140
from BuzzFeed I found out that he was

32
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,700
like what Malaysian Chinese like a few

33
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,729
weeks ago I was watching worth it and

34
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:35,490
there was an episode where he had

35
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:37,079
breakfast somewhere I think and then he

36
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,820
thought it would be like something that

37
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:41,520
his mom would make so he called his mom

38
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:44,100
in the car and I heard her speak English

39
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:48,090
and I was just like wait a second

40
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:49,409
because you just like know like this and

41
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,090
Corian and Malaysian accent it sounds

42
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:53,430
like super similar so I just like

43
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,170
quickly googled Steven Lim and turns out

44
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,700
he is a Malaysian Chinese descent so

45
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,619
that was pretty exciting for me so let's

46
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:02,700
get into these questions I am a

47
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:04,110
Malaysian by nationality and Chinese by

48
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,270
race Malaysia is one of those countries

49
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:08,340
where when you fill out a document they

50
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,840
have a slot for nationality where you

51
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,459
put like okay Malaysian and then they

52
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,950
have a slot for race and then you put

53
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,959
like

54
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:17,800
well race deworm the main races in

55
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:21,430
Malaysia arch Malay Chinese and Indian

56
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:23,620
and my axe is gonna break like I talked

57
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:25,030
about Malaysia of course like 99% of the

58
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,900
time when I talk in English I have an

59
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:29,680
American accent

60
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:31,420
because I'm I don't know I just I spend

61
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,160
most of my time here growing up 1% of

62
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,870
the time if I'm talking about something

63
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,489
that's like Malaysian my Malaysian

64
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:38,800
accent will like come out a little bit

65
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:40,660
some I guess minorities in Malaysia we

66
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,709
have a solid Japanese community there

67
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:46,720
are some Eurasians and we have we

68
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:49,300
definitely have Caucasian people leaving

69
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,739
leaving living in Malaysia my friends

70
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:54,250
that are Caucasian that live in Malaysia

71
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:57,190
are normally of some sort of like direct

72
00:02:54,250 --> 00:03:00,549
European New Zealand or Australian

73
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:02,319
descent none of them I know are American

74
00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:04,239
and where I'm from in Malaysia is

75
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,890
pinning Penang is one of the States and

76
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,840
Malaysia it's made up of an island and

77
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:09,459
some part of the state is on the

78
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,230
mainland of Malaysia the island is off

79
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:13,299
the west coast of Malaysia and from the

80
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:15,069
island part and it's exactly what you

81
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:15,940
think an island would be like it's very

82
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:18,100
tropical

83
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,900
there's jungle there's Beach but it's

84
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,180
also one of the most urban places in

85
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:24,220
Malaysia - so there's a lot of City and

86
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:26,380
things that are being built up and

87
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:29,109
changing especially since it got its

88
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:31,930
UNESCO World Heritage recognition years

89
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:33,760
ago a lot of things have been changing

90
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:35,799
it's been getting a lot cleaner and

91
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,359
honestly the cleanliness used to be part

92
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:39,670
of the culture shock for me going back

93
00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:41,290
home because it would be so different

94
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,910
like the cleanliness and the US versus

95
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:45,519
in where I was in Malaysia

96
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:47,739
what generation am i I'm the first

97
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,650
generation I was born in Malaysia and I

98
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:52,750
moved here when I was four years old I

99
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:55,299
moved to the Bay Area in California when

100
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:58,239
I was four I went to college in

101
00:03:55,299 --> 00:04:01,450
Massachusetts and and then now I'm down

102
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,880
here in Southern California we moved in

103
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:05,590
the beginning because of my dad's tech

104
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,900
job we were supposed to stay here for

105
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:10,630
about six months in the u.s. six months

106
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,220
became two years and it just it just

107
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:14,530
kept going from there okay so I grew up

108
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:17,470
in the Bay Area well it's in the US and

109
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:20,919
Malaysia Penang itself is also Penang

110
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:22,720
and the Bay Area are both really mixing

111
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:26,110
pot like places

112
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:30,730
they're quite diverse I never really

113
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:31,810
felt that I was I I knew there were

114
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:34,900
other people that looks like me

115
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:36,820
basically but of course I felt that more

116
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,650
when I went back to Malaysia Malaysia I

117
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:40,450
didn't feel so special but I think you

118
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:42,970
guys are asking for like oh like what

119
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:45,670
experiences did you feel different we're

120
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:48,340
like isolated you do remember few when I

121
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:49,900
was younger and they're not gonna be as

122
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,600
like nightmarish has some people get

123
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,040
some people's experience I know are like

124
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,930
like their mom's packed them like a

125
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,430
certain lunch and they brought it to

126
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,870
school and like their friends are just

127
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:02,500
like wait what is that that's so gross

128
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:04,960
and they get embarrassed by it but I was

129
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,910
lucky enough not to go through that um I

130
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,740
mean I sort of did in like fifth grade

131
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:12,220
basically what happened was that I

132
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:14,380
I brought a snack that had dried

133
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:17,140
anchovies and peanuts which is a Gumby

134
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,830
lace that was the terrible pronunciation

135
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,630
ikan bilis

136
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:21,280
it's a really good savory snack because

137
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:23,530
it has like protein a lot of protein in

138
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,270
it and keep see fall and it's tasty and

139
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:27,250
we serve it as a side on some dishes

140
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:30,430
this snack was from actually a Japanese

141
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:32,740
market but it had traces of dried

142
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:35,470
anchovy whole and roasted peanuts in it

143
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:36,940
so I got really excited because when

144
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:38,680
people especially if you're like a child

145
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,270
of an immigrant or an immigrant yourself

146
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,190
you eat a snack from your home country

147
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:45,520
and you're not there it kind of like

148
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:48,520
fills in a place like in your heart that

149
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:51,550
like no other food can where you are but

150
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,110
I brought to school and of course since

151
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:55,030
it's like a dried whole fish that I'm

152
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:57,340
enjoying I kind of knew that I would be

153
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:59,650
made fun of so whenever I brought it out

154
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:01,450
my friends would notice and that I would

155
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:04,210
just be like I'm eating a whole fish

156
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:05,740
like it's dried and it's gross but look

157
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:08,650
here goes the head and I like eat the

158
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:11,110
keep the head by itself and they're just

159
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:12,640
being like you're so weird I think there

160
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:14,740
was one person that like really called

161
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,330
me out on it and shoot anyway he was

162
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:19,510
like a South Asian descent I'm not gonna

163
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:20,770
say Indian because I'm not sure and he

164
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:23,169
was just like you know which eye he's

165
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:25,000
eating fish like and this is like you

166
00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:26,440
know the first break you have in school

167
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,210
if you go to public school in the US

168
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,850
like you have that first morning break I

169
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:32,830
was eating it then and she was like and

170
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:34,760
it's like he's having eats fish in the

171
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:38,030
morning like all dried in like

172
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:39,770
Oh's house it's like yeah I do because

173
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:42,320
it's good I think I felt more different

174
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:44,690
actually going home going back to

175
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,820
Malaysia we went back to Malaysia for

176
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:49,130
about two months every single year

177
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,900
growing up because um you know we still

178
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:52,550
my family still has their house there

179
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:55,100
and I remember once in the car I was

180
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:57,230
with my one of my cousins so my cousins

181
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:59,060
in Malaysia so much of public school

182
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:00,230
where Malay is taught heavily and then

183
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,270
some what's your international school

184
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:04,040
which is sort of like private school

185
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:06,020
there and a lot of international schools

186
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,630
around the world especially it's a

187
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:10,730
mostly American taught one of my cousins

188
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:12,110
that went to public school and one of my

189
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,610
cousin's that went to international

190
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:20,810
school in the car with me in the back

191
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:22,670
seat and they were just like the one so

192
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:25,220
a lot of kids that go to international

193
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:26,660
school sometimes don't know Malay as

194
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:29,000
well as the ones that go to public

195
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:30,740
school or like normal government school

196
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,080
okay we were all talking about something

197
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:34,310
and then my cousin goes the one that I

198
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,650
went to international school she goes

199
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:39,560
like she says a phrase in Malay and then

200
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:40,970
my other cousin laughs about it and I'm

201
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,320
just like wait what does that mean and

202
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,980
then she goes like you don't know what

203
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,590
that means

204
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:47,420
and I'm just like no and she was like

205
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,890
you how can you believe be Malaysian if

206
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:53,330
you don't know what no no no means and I

207
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:54,830
was just like um whoa it's it's a really

208
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:57,140
hard thing to answer because like you

209
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:59,060
it's something that you can't help yeah

210
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:00,950
I was kind of awkward because you don't

211
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,540
feel isolated every single day but

212
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:04,430
they're just like some moments like that

213
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:07,400
where you do but you don't feel Asian

214
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:09,620
enough or Western enough in some

215
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:12,380
situations and then there was like this

216
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:14,270
time a hawker stall hawker stalls are

217
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:16,580
basically like are like food carts and

218
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:18,200
they all gather in like a market and

219
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:20,510
it's great but anyway I was trying to

220
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:23,120
order something and when I order stuff

221
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:24,650
in Malaysia or they use my different

222
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,180
dialects of Chinese or I ordered it in

223
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:28,970
English and I chose to order it in

224
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,920
English this time and of course when I

225
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:33,380
spoke English my American accent was

226
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:37,430
very prevalent a person who was working

227
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:39,050
it didn't understand me once and then I

228
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:41,240
repeated it didn't understand me twice

229
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:43,969
and then she's like oh my god there's

230
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:46,370
something wall I was just like first of

231
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:48,270
all I was born here

232
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:51,360
I'm wanted

233
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:53,910
it literally means American but it's

234
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:58,980
sometimes used in a derogatory like form

235
00:08:53,910 --> 00:09:01,110
like this outsider and that I don't know

236
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:03,180
it's just it feels kind of weird hearing

237
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:05,700
that I like coming from like home home

238
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:08,220
you know what I mean what people like

239
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,959
referred to as home if you're if you're

240
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,100
not just like a major Asian American

241
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:13,320
people ask you oh like where are you

242
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,899
really from and it's just like I

243
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,300
associated both places with home to an

244
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:20,339
extent when I was back in Malaysia for

245
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:22,800
like the summers and stuff my cousins

246
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:24,060
would introduce me to their friends and

247
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,950
actually my grandma would actually

248
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:28,440
introduce my whole family to or like her

249
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:30,240
friends as like be like oh this is my

250
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:34,589
cousin from America and I'll just be

251
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:37,020
like um yes you kind of want to go back

252
00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:39,000
and be like I traveled like 27 hours to

253
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:40,800
get back to where I came from like this

254
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,260
is my I was born here oh this is my

255
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,020
cousin from us and I'm just like okay

256
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:48,060
well actually I was born here I have

257
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:50,130
always said that I was born here and

258
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:52,080
then I moved and then I come back every

259
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:54,000
summer because that's exactly what

260
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,829
happens because people say like in like

261
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,899
a certain friend group here I feel like

262
00:09:55,829 --> 00:10:00,180
I'm the Asian I don't really get that

263
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:01,740
feeling but when they go back to where

264
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,779
their mother country is they'll be like

265
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:06,420
oh I'm the American that I can really

266
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:08,790
relate to people definitely when I was

267
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:10,709
doing like my internships or whereas

268
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:12,630
basically like socializing with my

269
00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:14,279
cousin's are their friends in Malaysia

270
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:16,500
they would definitely see me as the

271
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:18,360
American were you always proud of your

272
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:23,700
heritage or was there a time you

273
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:26,250
rejected it um I don't really remember a

274
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:28,380
time where I like rejected my Malaysian

275
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:31,800
açaí always grew up I think my mom

276
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:34,050
always made sure that I knew I was I was

277
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:37,560
born in Malaysia duh and came here when

278
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:40,140
I was four and that Malaysian culture

279
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:44,310
definitely like runs through my blood

280
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:45,930
and even though I I feel mostly American

281
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:48,390
I got really confused in college though

282
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:50,040
because um I know a lot of my college

283
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:51,149
friends are gonna watch this but like

284
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,520
and it's not your fault

285
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:56,910
College was a time when a lot of my

286
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:59,339
friends from Malaysia their siblings

287
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:01,290
would come to college with me because

288
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:04,500
Emily Penang at least

289
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:07,500
a very small island but is heavily

290
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:09,480
populated and so you know people even

291
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,399
when you go out like marketing or

292
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,500
something or to the mall you'll know

293
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:16,500
someone by like three degrees I once

294
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:19,110
rented a car with my mom in Connecticut

295
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,459
and the woman who rented it to us was

296
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:22,019
Malaysian and we could tell us I mean

297
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:24,750
guess where we were from because she

298
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:25,889
could clearly tell from us too and she

299
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,630
we were like oh we're from Malaysia and

300
00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:29,310
she was like oh we should part and we

301
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:32,819
say oh we're from Penang and they just

302
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:34,560
like I'm from Penang too and we knew we

303
00:11:32,819 --> 00:11:38,069
were gonna be related to somehow turns

304
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,810
out that her mom goes to church and his

305
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:42,420
friends of my grandma on my mother's

306
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:46,110
side a lot of my friends like their

307
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:49,410
family members who are my age started to

308
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:52,110
come to college in the same area as me

309
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:55,470
and we would hang out sometimes which

310
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:59,339
was pretty cool but they would hang out

311
00:11:55,470 --> 00:12:02,490
a lot more with each other and I felt

312
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:03,660
like I wasn't it was because they

313
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:06,269
weren't inviting me to hang out with

314
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,870
them because they couldn't connect to me

315
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:09,480
on that

316
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:11,970
Malaysian level like I wasn't Malaysian

317
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,040
enough to be invited to hang out

318
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:17,639
sometimes and he became a huge identity

319
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:19,050
crisis because I was just like do I try

320
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:21,630
to hang out with my Malaysian friends or

321
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:23,610
do I hang out with like my American

322
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:25,649
friends that I'm used to like for most

323
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:27,990
of the time I spent growing up I got

324
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:30,389
really worked up about it and I remember

325
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:33,660
telling my Malaysian friend who was like

326
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:37,110
the closest to me in college majoring if

327
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:38,819
you're out there I I remember telling

328
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:40,500
her that I didn't know what to do

329
00:12:38,819 --> 00:12:42,600
she was like the thing I thought all you

330
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,459
like av season in many Asian Americans

331
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,439
is that like you're both and you don't

332
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:49,139
realize it I'm like yeah I do realize it

333
00:12:46,439 --> 00:12:51,329
I never fit in anywhere like completely

334
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:53,970
and she's like well just realize that

335
00:12:51,329 --> 00:12:57,600
you have the best of both even though

336
00:12:53,970 --> 00:13:00,180
you won't really fit into one so I guess

337
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,980
I guess that's what I'm stuck with

338
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:04,680
there's some stereotypes that you

339
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:06,930
struggle with the general Asian American

340
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:08,880
stereotype that I struggle with is the

341
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:10,410
stereotype that all Asians are supposed

342
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,139
to be good at math and science

343
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:15,110
honestly music art in English from in

344
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:18,380
languages where my strongest subjects

345
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:20,990
school and I had to work twice as hard

346
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:22,610
in math and science to just keep up with

347
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:24,170
everybody else I remember I really

348
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:26,120
remember in kindergarten like everyone

349
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:29,000
would be out at recess and I would still

350
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:33,380
be working on 2+2 just trying to figure

351
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:35,240
out why does 2+2 make for and I remember

352
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,829
I would always be let out to recess late

353
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,050
because I would always be stuck on math

354
00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:41,540
problems but reading came really easy to

355
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:43,579
me and so did spelling I just hear it in

356
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:46,010
my head and see the words and because I

357
00:13:43,579 --> 00:13:48,350
spent so much of my time studying for

358
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:51,290
math and science just to make you know

359
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:53,209
like what sometimes I didn't even make

360
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:55,610
the grades I wanted and I would like

361
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:57,019
study like twice as hard as my friends

362
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:58,339
my friends would always see me studying

363
00:13:57,019 --> 00:14:00,560
like my classmates would always see me

364
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:02,930
studying and they'd be like if you think

365
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,870
I would be like super smart or something

366
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:08,149
and I remember one of my friends in bio

367
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:09,709
we were in the back and we were taking

368
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:11,660
an exam who's like do you want to do you

369
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:14,690
want to cheat and I was it's like not

370
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:16,339
really it was like but you're like super

371
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:18,649
smart you're like always like studying

372
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:21,860
and you must you must know what to do

373
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:23,029
I'm just like no I'm studying because I

374
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:25,459
suck at this

375
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:28,850
I'm stereotype really like that's the

376
00:14:25,459 --> 00:14:30,380
one that really like affects me everyone

377
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:32,420
thinks grades and Asian households are

378
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:34,910
just like number one and yeah our

379
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:37,310
parents my parents that really do set

380
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:38,600
that bar really high if I got something

381
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:41,390
that I didn't wanted I would just take

382
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:43,790
it so badly and I still do that

383
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:45,350
sometimes like I would get like a mark

384
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:46,790
that I didn't want and I'd be like oh

385
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:49,640
even though I worked so hard for that

386
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:51,829
mark and I'd be like it's still not this

387
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:54,920
mark I still can't change myself to get

388
00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:56,690
this mark grades man grades kill us

389
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,820
Asians like seriously the other

390
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:00,199
stereotype that really gets me is a

391
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:03,140
Malaysian stereotype and that is

392
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:04,579
speaking several languages so Malaysians

393
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:06,170
are really multilingual if we speak

394
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:08,690
different languages too depending on who

395
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:11,899
we're talking to I kind of really like

396
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:13,670
learning languages and so I've picked up

397
00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:16,250
some language is the basics of some

398
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:17,990
sometimes for like work or for fun and I

399
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:20,870
would try to practice them speaking with

400
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:22,820
people that are like around that speak

401
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:24,620
that language like around here because

402
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:26,329
this place is so diverse California is

403
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:28,590
so diverse and they'd be like what are

404
00:15:26,329 --> 00:15:31,820
you doing like why are you speaking

405
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:34,650
you try to speak Japanese to me cuz like

406
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:35,970
because I just want to and you know it

407
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:38,460
if you try to speak like different

408
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:41,190
languages like in Malaysia like no one

409
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:42,540
cares like they think they don't think

410
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,040
like it's cool they don't think like

411
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,940
you're trying to be like someone they

412
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,540
don't think like you're Korea

413
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:49,440
boo-boo-boo no they just think like

414
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:51,060
she's just trying to speak different

415
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,500
languages here if you speak like a

416
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,240
different language or someone especially

417
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,950
if that person is so like the same

418
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,470
generation as you they're just like as

419
00:15:55,950 --> 00:16:00,000
me at least my generation they're just

420
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:02,130
like what are you trying to do

421
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,950
can you speak your language yes and no

422
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:08,430
so Malaysia as I said is made up of like

423
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:10,800
several different languages the national

424
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:11,940
language is male and that I am the worst

425
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,880
at I can

426
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:17,610
I know phrases to get me by but I don't

427
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:20,730
really know census how I learned how to

428
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:22,860
count to four for example was the a

429
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:25,170
local aquarium my favorite aquarium

430
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:27,180
Monterey Bay Aquarium in California the

431
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:29,790
Monterey Bay California had four waters

432
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:31,530
for Southeast Asian river otters that

433
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:34,530
were on loan I think from Singapore Zoo

434
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:37,410
and their names were 1 2 3 & 4

435
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:41,010
in Malay so stock to do what you gonna

436
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:42,600
but were their names people who I think

437
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:44,790
people are like oh my gosh their names

438
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,740
are so like foreign and like cool but it

439
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:49,110
really just means 1 2 3 & 4 and that's

440
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:52,830
how I learned how to say 1 2 count to 4

441
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:55,380
Emily I speak Hakka hookean because of

442
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:57,900
my parents because my dad speaks hookean

443
00:16:55,380 --> 00:17:00,180
which is very prevalent in Panay it's a

444
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:03,360
Chinese dialect and so he mixes that in

445
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:04,980
with English my mom speaks Hakka and she

446
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,180
makes it that in with English it's to

447
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,890
the point where she hasn't become

448
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:10,050
comfortable with my friends hanging out

449
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:12,780
at my house and she's just speaking in

450
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:15,150
both languages to me and I'm just like

451
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:19,890
mom they don't understand you you have

452
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:22,290
to speak English only should just be

453
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:23,520
like but I'm comfortable like this and

454
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:25,890
I'm like okay never mind

455
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,300
Mandarin Chinese that is probably my

456
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:30,960
second strongest language and it's

457
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:34,230
because my mom heavily insisted that my

458
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,400
brother and I learn Mandarin in school

459
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:37,020
to the point where she sent us to

460
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,670
elementary school where about half of

461
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:40,050
our classes were in Mandarin Chinese I

462
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:41,350
would know I wouldn't say that I

463
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:43,360
wouldn't understand it for

464
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:45,880
because it's gonna sound really snobby

465
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,010
to some people but my mom would

466
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:50,440
sometimes use being monolingual as a

467
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:51,880
threat to me and my brother she just

468
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:55,809
really didn't want my brother nights

469
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:57,340
missed out on being multilingual like

470
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:58,809
people were in Malaysia like how kids

471
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:01,030
were in Malaysia like how they would

472
00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:03,910
speak Chinese to each other in school

473
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:06,549
and learn English in school and they

474
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:08,320
would speak Malay to like someone

475
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:09,549
outside she would be like oh you want to

476
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,169
just speak you just want to speak

477
00:18:09,549 --> 00:18:13,120
English like all those kids out there

478
00:18:11,169 --> 00:18:14,409
you don't wanna you want to be multi you

479
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,030
don't want to speak Chinese and like

480
00:18:14,409 --> 00:18:19,179
open more opportunities for yourself and

481
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:20,650
I was just like no like because it's

482
00:18:19,179 --> 00:18:22,659
nice I would get hard it would get hard

483
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:24,220
balancing math and Chinese and math in

484
00:18:22,659 --> 00:18:26,200
English I'm definitely really thankful

485
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:28,870
though that I did learn Mandarin Chinese

486
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:33,100
growing up because I used a dish every

487
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:34,900
day like at work and trying to find more

488
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,940
work for sure being multilingual

489
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:39,640
definitely has inspired me to take on

490
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:41,380
more languages and because when you try

491
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,840
to learn more languages you kind of like

492
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:45,190
build a bridge it's like connecting with

493
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,530
more people and that's really

494
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:49,799
fascinating me it has definitely had its

495
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:51,909
pros and cons being asian-american and

496
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:55,870
affecting my relationship with my

497
00:18:51,909 --> 00:18:58,120
parents the hard part is that as I said

498
00:18:55,870 --> 00:19:01,510
I'm stronger I was stronger like

499
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:03,010
languages growing up and art growing up

500
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:04,960
in school but I was interested in

501
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:06,909
working with animals so the road to

502
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,100
being interested in working with animals

503
00:19:06,909 --> 00:19:11,559
was very math and science heavy and that

504
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:13,030
was really that's really hard for me but

505
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:16,030
then I always knew that I had a creative

506
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:19,530
side hence the YouTube I know I just got

507
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:23,020
more into like making like videos and

508
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:26,080
like being more crafty and so I'm

509
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:28,270
currently trying to like chase that a

510
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:32,409
bit I'm currently trying to be more

511
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:35,140
involved in thumb and videos video

512
00:19:32,409 --> 00:19:37,150
making producing specifically if you

513
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:39,669
meet a producer please hit me up anyway

514
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:41,620
so that part has been hard because you

515
00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:42,850
know how the stereotype how easy Asian

516
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:44,409
parents don't want like their kids

517
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:46,750
picked chasing arts because it's

518
00:19:44,409 --> 00:19:48,159
unstable that stereotype is definitely

519
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,929
true for me

520
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:51,760
America is like the hub of entertainment

521
00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:54,160
of the world and some in some aspects

522
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,980
so chasing the industry

523
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,600
makes it hard on my Asian side but in a

524
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,920
way being asian-american has definitely

525
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,470
made me more connected with my parents

526
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:04,620
to in a way that like will have like a

527
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:08,050
family conversation back in Malaysia

528
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:10,030
with some of my Malaysian like family

529
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:12,040
members and they will have a perspective

530
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:15,280
on how to solve a problem that I will

531
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:17,260
have that that is very Western influence

532
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,000
that my the Asian side of my family like

533
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:21,100
would not be able to see and so that's

534
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,960
sort of like what brought has brought me

535
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:25,540
closer to my parents which is really

536
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,100
unique and definitely I something I

537
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:29,520
would not have seen coming when I was

538
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:32,140
younger it's like they understand you

539
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:35,980
yeah no my parents what's really funny

540
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:38,320
is that my dad is very very very

541
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:41,470
American to the point where he doesn't

542
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,780
really like to associate with his Asian

543
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:47,800
Asst but when he's pissed like when he's

544
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:50,380
mad like all of that accent will drop

545
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:52,230
like and he'll be like speaking his like

546
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:56,200
hook down like mom though my mom really

547
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:58,480
embraces her Asian side for sure she

548
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,250
embraces her agents her like her eastern

549
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,960
side I think like probably a bit more

550
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,640
than her western side she definitely has

551
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,950
a western side to her and I think that's

552
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:08,620
a that's true for a lot of like

553
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:10,870
immigrants like in their home countries

554
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:14,860
because or children of immigrants

555
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:18,280
because like you will identify with your

556
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:20,650
like home country a bit like it differs

557
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:22,150
per person to what extent they identify

558
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:24,160
with it how do you feel about your

559
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:26,650
heritage now do you identify with it

560
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:30,010
I do identify with it how I feel about

561
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:32,020
it now is pretty good especially after

562
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:33,400
college I think yeah I think college is

563
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:35,320
when I felt the worst about it I've

564
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,160
accepted that I'm never gonna be truly

565
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,680
home

566
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:41,470
somewhere like I can't completely

567
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:43,990
associate a place with home kind of

568
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:46,540
learn to be to like represent the best

569
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:48,700
of both have fun with the best of both

570
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:51,070
worlds Hannah Montana reference right

571
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,600
there instead of just feeling incomplete

572
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:55,180
with both what's your favorite thing

573
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,870
about being an Asian American or about

574
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:59,800
your heritage

575
00:21:55,870 --> 00:22:02,050
I mean having the best of both cultures

576
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,820
is always plus honestly the best part

577
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:05,810
about being Asian American is just like

578
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:07,520
being open to more cultures I think

579
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:08,990
just like being able to connect with

580
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,730
more people because there are

581
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:13,130
similarities and differences between the

582
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:14,480
Asian cultures just like being able to

583
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:16,880
connect on some things that are common

584
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,850
or being introduced to things that are

585
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,590
different and sort of giving you a new

586
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:24,440
perspective that's really cool also the

587
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:25,880
food is bomb like I'm just gonna leave

588
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,620
it there I like being a Malaysian

589
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,690
because like I think I'm very lucky in

590
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:31,520
that I'm part of a culture that is super

591
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:33,860
diverse and open to new cultures

592
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:37,120
honestly like if you listen to like the

593
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:43,310

594
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:45,500
Chinese pop western pop kpop in like

595
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:47,720
there's some Bollywood and Malay songs

596
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:51,950
in there and it's just like it's it's so

597
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:52,430
much fun that diversity is pretty lit in

598
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:54,170
Malaysia

599
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:56,570
especially Malaysia's music makes me

600
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:59,060
more like open to different music genres

601
00:22:56,570 --> 00:23:00,440
