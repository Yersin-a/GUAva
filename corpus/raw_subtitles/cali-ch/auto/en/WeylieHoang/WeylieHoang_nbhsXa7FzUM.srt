00:00:05,319 --> 00:00:08,960
hi everyone and welcome back to your

3
00:00:08,059 --> 00:00:11,120
girls Channel

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,040
so today I have a topic that I've been

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,929
wanting to talk about for years now and

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,000
I don't know why I never really got

7
00:00:14,929 --> 00:00:18,529
around to talking about it a part of me

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,689
feels like it's not something that

9
00:00:18,529 --> 00:00:22,310
people would be necessarily interested

10
00:00:20,689 --> 00:00:23,960
in but as I'm getting older more and

11
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,910
more I find myself thinking about this

12
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,380
almost on a daily basis and whether or

13
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,059
not this is something that affects your

14
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:30,950
life I hope that this is a video that

15
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:32,239
you can pass on to people in your life

16
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:35,000
that are probably dealing with the same

17
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,440
thing because growing up for me this was

18
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,090
something that was really hard and I

19
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,460
didn't realize I played such a huge role

20
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:42,110
in my life until my adulthood and the

21
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:44,300
topic is about growing up as a

22
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:45,620
chinese-american and obviously you do

23
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,060
not have to be Chinese to be watching

24
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,460
this video I'm just sharing with you

25
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:52,040
guys my experience and how I grew up so

26
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:53,780
just apply it in your own life and with

27
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,370
that being said let's just jump right in

28
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,079
and get started so I want to start off

29
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:59,360
to give a little backstory in case you

30
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:01,520
guys are new to my channel so when I was

31
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,710
growing up my parents never really like

32
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,549
told me oh Whaley you're Chinese or

33
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:06,110
you're Asian

34
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:07,250
believe it or not growing up I didn't

35
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,570
even realize that there were other

36
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:10,820
ethnic backgrounds in the world I

37
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:12,110
thought we were all the same people I

38
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,970
obviously noticed a difference between

39
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:15,680
me and my classmates I would see that we

40
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,390
have different hair colors different eye

41
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,700
colors and we would speak a different

42
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:21,140
language back at home but for some

43
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,670
reason and never clicked to me because

44
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,710
my parents never like drilled in my head

45
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:26,900
like oh you're Asian or you're Chinese I

46
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:29,030
just saw everyone as human beings and

47
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,470
that may sound stupid to y'all but for

48
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,510
real I did not know the difference

49
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:33,830
growing up I just thought everyone was

50
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:35,720
taught different things in their

51
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:37,729
household but I didn't realize that

52
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,350
meant that we came from a different like

53
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:41,360
ethnic background so the first day of

54
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,430
preschool rolled around and it was

55
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,380
nothing like I expected it I grew up

56
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,939
just speaking Cantonese Chinese whatever

57
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,290
you want to call it in my family my

58
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:49,850
family didn't see the need of teaching

59
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:51,439
me English because they felt like well

60
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:53,180
she's gonna learn it in school anyway so

61
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,470
might as well teach her like her native

62
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,750
tongue serve on my voice I'm like

63
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:58,490
recovering from a cold so this voice is

64
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,630
just all weird since I all right but

65
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:02,060
going back to what I was saying my

66
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:03,770
parents did not teach me a word of

67
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:06,830
English I probably knew things like

68
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:08,360
Apple I knew my name and that's pretty

69
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,979
much about it I didn't know English at

70
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,290
all going into preschool so I remember

71
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:15,439
going to school looking at everyone it

72
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:17,150
was like what are they saying eventually

73
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:17,730
by the end of preschool I picked up on

74
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,530
the lane

75
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:22,049
and we went into kindergarten and I

76
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:24,209
understood English just fine then third

77
00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:26,310
grade came around and third grade was

78
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:28,230
about the time mark where I started

79
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:30,150
feeling uncomfortable about being

80
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,830
Chinese growing up in my family all we

81
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,959
ate was Chinese food every meal

82
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:35,549
consisted of rice so you each have your

83
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:37,470
bowl of rice and then there's all the

84
00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:39,660
meats and veggies or whatever and we all

85
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:42,480
share it hardly did I ever eat anything

86
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:44,970
outside of Chinese food the only like

87
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,670
taste of American food I would get would

88
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:49,019
probably be like McDonald's or sometimes

89
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,610
we would go to Denny's which is a diner

90
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:52,110
sorry I think I said third grade earlier

91
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:54,900
but I'm in second grade second grade is

92
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:57,150
the first time I started feeling any

93
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,709
sort of discrimination second grade not

94
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,359
third grade in second grade I moved to a

95
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:02,129
new school and I was super excited about

96
00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:03,450
it and I wanted to buy school lunches

97
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:05,430
because I've always kind of like brought

98
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,569
my own lunch and no one's ever really

99
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,920
said anything about it I think it's

100
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:09,540
because we were younger at the time in

101
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,879
second grade I decided the first day of

102
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:13,950
school mom I want to buy lunch at school

103
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:15,599
I just wanted to try it so my parents

104
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:17,220
gave me lunch money that day and when I

105
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,140
went into the lunch line I remember

106
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,690
looking at everything and I was just

107
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:23,190
like how do you eat this after that day

108
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:25,319
I went home and I was telling my mom

109
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:27,269
like I don't really like the food like

110
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:28,560
that's not what I want to eat so I think

111
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:30,630
I'm just gonna go back to bringing my

112
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,829
own food so my mom was like cool okay

113
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,720
growing up something that my parents

114
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:35,790
would always make like this was my

115
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,380
favorite thing this was my dream I ate

116
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,780
it almost every single day

117
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:42,150
and it is pork belly with pickled

118
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:45,239
mustard greens it's like a stew that you

119
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:47,700
would make and it was just uh it was so

120
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:50,430
so good anytime that my mom made sooner

121
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,209
I caught you I would be like oh today is

122
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,160
my lucky day

123
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:54,569
so that night my mom made a big old pot

124
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,040
of its unless she can pack me lunch for

125
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:58,380
the next day and she put it in like this

126
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,269
like thermal warmer thing it was like a

127
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,069
it was like a cup like this there were

128
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:04,319
layers on the top she put my rice and on

129
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:06,120
the bottom she put the meat and I was so

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,680
excited about lunch time okay girl like

00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,060
I knew that was in my lunch bag and like

132
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,980
while I was in class I was like looking

00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,780

134
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,639

143
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,139

America you don't call bacon pork belly

155
00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:53,180
you call it bacon but it's really pork

156
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,090

157
00:04:53,180 --> 00:05:00,110

158
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:02,570
like hey what are you eating why are you

159
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:04,789
eating that that's so disgusting

160
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:06,259
oh my god it smells so bad literally

161
00:05:04,789 --> 00:05:07,310
everyone just started talking about it

162
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:09,320
and they made it seem like the most

163
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:12,259
disgusting thing ever they all walked

164
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:15,139
away and I remember just like my heart

165
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:16,520
sunk I felt so embarrassed but I didn't

166
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:18,320
even know what I was embarrassed about

167
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,210
because I literally went from oh my god

168
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,639
I'm so proud that I'm eating this and

169
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:24,500
I'm having this - oh my god why did

170
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,139
everyone freak out I don't understand

171
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,639
I felt so so embarrassed like I didn't

172
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:30,409
even know if I should even eat anymore

173
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,789
at that point I was really hungry it

174
00:05:30,409 --> 00:05:33,919
smelled really good I wanted to eat it

175
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:36,080
but because everyone looked at me as if

176
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,419
it's so disgusting I felt like if I ate

177
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,830
it that would mean I'm disgusting so I

178
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:42,050
took a few bites and I just put it away

179
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:44,389
and I pretended like I didn't even like

180
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:46,190
it myself and I remember just feeling so

181
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:48,409
disgusted with myself because I was

182
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:50,060
lying to myself you know I wanted to fit

183
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:51,770
in so I acted like something that I

184
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,780
liked and something that I was so proud

185
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:55,310
of what's disgusting to me so the next

186
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:58,280
door I want to talk about is the day I

187
00:05:55,310 --> 00:06:01,340
found out I was Chinese okay it was a

188
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:03,020
day in third grade where a new kid came

189
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:05,449
to our school I believe he was Taiwanese

190
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:07,520
so he spoke Mandarin and he had a really

191
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:08,659
flat face which I hate to even say that

192
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,610
but let's just be real like I have a

193
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:11,990
really flat face and seriously can we

194
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,669
talk about this without people getting

195
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:16,550
offended I'm just gonna be real and just

196
00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:19,250
describe what I feel okay most Asian

197
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:21,139
people do have more of a flatter profile

198
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,870
and if you don't that's great I'm not

199
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:25,759
saying all Asians do many of us don't

200
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:27,469
have really prominent cheekbones we

201
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,330
don't have deep set eyes I remember

202
00:06:27,469 --> 00:06:31,340
that's how a nice kid he had a really

203
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:33,979
really flat face like even more flat

204
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:35,840
than mine and all the kids in class were

205
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:37,250
making fun of him and I overheard them

206
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,659
and they're just like he has such a flat

207
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,810
face like did he get slapped or

208
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:41,760
something growing up grow

209
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:43,320
I was someone that just listened to

210
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,210
everybody else I never really had an

211
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,680
opinion of my own like if that's what

212
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:48,210
the majority is saying I'm gonna be like

213
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,010
okay yeah you're right so there was a

214
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:52,139
moment where those mean kids looked at

215
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:54,480
me and they looked at me as if they were

216
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:56,220
waiting for me to like jump in and say

217
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,690
something too and me being the loser

218
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,460
that I was I'm just like oh [ __ ] that's

219
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:00,660
what they're saying like I need to agree

220
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,490
with them because otherwise they would

221
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,650
laugh at me so I say back to them like

222
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:07,230
yeah he has such a flat face and then

223
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:08,790
they all bursted out laughing looked at

224
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:10,110
me and one of the guys were like so do

225
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:11,940
you aren't you guys the same or

226
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:13,800
something so that day after school I go

227
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,000
home and I tell my mom and I'm like kids

228
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,470
at school were making fun of me saying

229
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,330
that I have a flat face like do I have a

230
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:20,040
flat face I remember my mom saying like

231
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:21,690
hey hold on let me sigh don't say Casey

232
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,070
well they didn't go again then which in

233
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:24,750
translation my mom was just like huh

234
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:26,490
maybe it's just those kids making fun of

235
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:28,830
us Asian people and I was just like

236
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:30,660
what's the difference so my mom broke it

237
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:33,060
down to me explained to me that you know

238
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:35,639
we are different like we are minorities

239
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:38,040
in this country and bla bla bla so on so

240
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:41,220
forth and that for me explained so much

241
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:43,320
about why I don't eat food that kids at

242
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,510
school eat or why sometimes I don't

243
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:47,760
understand words because the only way I

244
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:50,789
can express it is in Chinese and that

245
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:52,830
explains why I struggled so much in

246
00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:54,090
English which brings me to my next story

247
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:56,010
I hope you guys aren't born these

248
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:58,860
stories yet but this is the last story I

249
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:59,789
want to tell and that is me struggling a

250
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,520
lot as a kid

251
00:07:59,789 --> 00:08:03,990
in English so I remember kids would read

252
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,760
books and like we had to take these

253
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:07,380
tests at the end of like each book that

254
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,810
we read just to see how much we absorb

255
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:12,660
the material and I remember I would fail

256
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:14,190
every single test even though I read the

257
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,470
book or at least I thought I read the

258
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:18,450
book reading was a really really hard

259
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:20,100
thing because I was learning English at

260
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:21,600
school but the second I got home I'm

261
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,070
speaking Chinese with my family

262
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,350
throughout elementary school throughout

263
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:27,810
middle school I struggled so hard I can

264
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:31,050
never pass those reading tests I was

265
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:32,610
testing two to three grades below what I

266
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:34,289
was supposed to be say I was in fifth

267
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:36,000
grade I was at a reading level of a

268
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:38,400
second third grader after my parents

269
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,620
knowing that I was testing so low in my

270
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,450
reading or my English test instead of

271
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:45,060
trying to understand why I was testing

272
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:46,830
that way my mom immediately just got mad

273
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:49,230
at me and was like you watched too much

274
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:50,140
TV why don't you study more you're born

275
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,970
and raised in America

276
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:54,460
how do you not know English and if you

277
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:56,650
ask me that was pretty shitty to be told

278
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:58,360
as a kid because I don't know like I

279
00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:00,580
don't know why I suck at this it's like

280
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,500
I'm trying [ __ ] I'm trying like I'm

281
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:04,330
trying to read these goddamned books but

282
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,190
I can't understand it it's just it's

283
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:08,710
just so confusing for me and I think any

284
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:10,600
kid growing up in a bilingual family can

285
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:12,280
relate like for real I was struggling

286
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,500
because there were all these kids in

287
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:16,900
class reading Harry Potter and Harry

288
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:19,600
Potter is a big book y'all like it is

289
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:21,100
this thick okay while everybody was on

290
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,650
there Harry Potter I was still on my

291
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,940
Junie P Jones okay so those were the few

292
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:27,310
stories I wanted to share with you guys

293
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:29,350
sorry if I bored you those were the

294
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:31,450
moments for me growing up that impacted

295
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:34,480
me so much and with that being said I

296
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:36,640
want to talk about how I have learned to

297
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,770
be proud of being chinese-american and

298
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,780
being different and the way that I have

299
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:43,060
coped with it is that I told myself

300
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:45,310
there's nothing to be embarrassed about

301
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:47,920
like what is wrong with being a minority

302
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:49,570
what is wrong with being different what

303
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,730
is wrong with speaking a different

304
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:52,210
language outside of English I asked

305
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,220
myself

306
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:56,200
shouldn't I be proud that I know two

307
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:58,360
languages shouldn't I be proud that I

308
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,670
know two different cultures and what is

309
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,230
wrong with mine whether a person speaks

310
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:05,020
another language eats a different type

311
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:06,340
of food or not we are all people like

312
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:08,530
when it comes down to it we're all

313
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:10,720
people we're all just people trying to

314
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:12,970
make it in this world and shouldn't we

315
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,800
bring our differences together and share

316
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:16,300
that with each other and learn from each

317
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,720
other just take a second and imagine

318
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:22,030
what if everyone in this world were

319
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:24,160
American and we all ate the same thing

320
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:26,440
we all spoke the same language and there

321
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,970
was nothing else beyond that what if we

322
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,890
were all the same with the same exact

323
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:31,780
value spoke the same language ate the

324
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:33,400
same food then there won't be much to

325
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:35,200
share it wasn't until like the end of

326
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,240
high school where I realized I wanted to

327
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,580
embrace being Chinese it helped me

328
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,110
tremendously when I started surrounding

329
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:43,330
myself with people who wanted me to

330
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,680
embrace that side of me and that is one

331
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:46,510
of my biggest advice to you guys

332
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:49,180
surround yourself with people who

333
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:51,580
genuinely are curious about you want to

334
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:53,080
know about you and respect you because

335
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:55,000
if you surround yourself with people who

336
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:57,220
are just gonna make fun of you make you

337
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,500
feel ashamed of who you are that's what

338
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:01,000
you're gonna be so girl if you're around

339
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,620
people that want to

340
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,380
I thought your language want to laugh of

341
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:07,690
what you eat laugh of what you wear you

342
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:09,250
are putting yourself in the wrong place

343
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:11,920
and by the way as many of you guys know

344
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:14,530
WOM my boyfriend he's Chinese as well

345
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,480
and dating him was not like a plan thing

346
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:18,070
I did it like date him because oh my god

347
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,780
he's Chinese I want to be with a Chinese

348
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:22,090
guy it just so happened to be that he

349
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:25,450
was Chinese and he is someone that

350
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:26,260
embraces being Chinese so so much he was

351
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:28,060
a type of kid

352
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:30,310
to bring a ham using your pen to school

353
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:32,560
okay like if you bring ham you take no

354
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:35,290
pen to school you don't [ __ ] play you

355
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,480
are embracing the most Chinese side of

356
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:40,510
you if you bring a ham using your pen to

357
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:42,610
school or to work okay I'm using a pen

358
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:45,730
is basically a steamed dish with salted

359
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:48,100
fish and pork it's like a pancake it's

360
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:51,160
like a meat pancake but the salty fish

361
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:53,590
oh my god it smells so so strong like if

362
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,220
I microwaved a hob using a bang in my

363
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,870
house right now

364
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,580
you would smell it throughout my entire

365
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:59,410
apartment okay and while was this type

366
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:01,480
of guy growing up where he was so proud

367
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:03,970
of who he was he had no shame in it and

368
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,010
ever since dating him he has really

369
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:08,589
drilled that into me so like I said

370
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:10,300
earlier the biggest advice I can give to

371
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:13,089
you if you're dealing with just some

372
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:14,830
sort of embarrassment or shame about you

373
00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:17,080
having a different ethnic background

374
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:20,560
please surround yourself with people who

375
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:21,970
genuinely want you to thrive and instead

376
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,460
of seeing your differences of something

377
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:26,050
embarrassing see it as something I can

378
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:28,300
bring to the table like let me tell

379
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:30,580
y'all about my pork belly let me tell

380
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,140
y'all about my salted fish and if after

381
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,610
you tell people what you like to eat or

382
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,890
how you grew up and they want to be

383
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:36,400
disgusted it turned off or whatever

384
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:38,530
about it

385
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,540
let them be like let them be

386
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:42,670
closed-minded don't ever close yourself

387
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:44,500
off and think that you shouldn't share

388
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:46,480
your differences because that is what

389
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,520
makes this world so beautiful all of our

390
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,110
differences coming together as one and

391
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:52,150
people learning about each other I know

392
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:54,339
music plays a huge role in many people's

393
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:55,900
lives and for me growing up I didn't

394
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:59,320
know who I sure was

395
00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:00,490
neo Beyonce Pussycat Dolls like those

396
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,690
were the artists that you know when I

397
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:03,460
was growing up those were the artists

398
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:04,690
that were like poppin you know and I

399
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:06,220
remember going to school and all these

400
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:07,750
girls would have sure on their binder

401
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,280
and they're like oh my god this is Asher

402
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:12,130
and I'm just like who dad because the

403
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,750
only artists that I know is twins boys

404
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:16,090
chang-geun Haley

405
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:18,250
Hakan young Joey tan while on like those

406
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:19,540
are the only hardest that I listen to

407
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,250
and those are the only artists that I

408
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:23,170
knew and because I wanted to fit in I

409
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:24,610
started to listen to the music that

410
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:26,470
other kids were listening to and it

411
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:28,180
wasn't that I didn't like it but my

412
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:29,530
heart was with Chinese music because

413
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:31,360
that is what I grew up with that is what

414
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:33,280
I know and that's what I like and for

415
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,160
years I would download songs into my

416
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:38,710
ipod that I personally did not really

417
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,750
enjoy listening to just so that in case

418
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:42,460
another kid from my class wanted to

419
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:44,260
listen to my music they'd be like oh

420
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,730
[ __ ] Wei Lee knows the new songs and

421
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:47,980
stuff and I just remember feeling like

422
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:49,990
this is not me this is not what I want

423
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:51,760
to listen to nowadays if you guys pick

424
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:53,980
up my phone you go to my music all I

425
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,990
have is Chinese music the only way I

426
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,790
know of new American songs coming out is

427
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:59,770
through my friends and wah and I mean I

428
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:02,620
still enjoy listening to it but for me

429
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:04,300
the music that really inspires me or

430
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:06,310
music that really connects with me is

431
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:08,080
Chinese music and I have no shame in it

432
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:09,820
I would be blasting that [ __ ] girl I'm

433
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,860
like driving with my windows down I'm

434
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,510
like blasting my Chinese music and yes

435
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,950
people next to me will probably be like

436
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:16,540
what the [ __ ] is she listening to like

437
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:18,100
that's not cool like what is that it

438
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:20,740
sounds so weird but I'm just like hey

439
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:22,270
you listen to your music I listen to

440
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:24,430
mine this is what I like to listen to

441
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:26,380
and I'm a jam out to it right this video

442
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:28,390
is getting really long as always every

443
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:30,670
time we do girl talk we talk forever

444
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:32,410
okay I think I got most of the things

445
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,730
that I wanted to talk about out and

446
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:35,589
maybe after watching this video you're

447
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:37,390
still feeling a little iffy and you feel

448
00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:38,980
like you don't really know how to apply

449
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:41,380
these things into your life because it

450
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,970
is hard you know it is hard to embrace

451
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,890
something that's so different to people

452
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:46,930
who aren't used to it and you feel

453
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:48,970
embarrassed you feel judged but the most

454
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:52,300
important thing is you got to surround

455
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:54,940
yourself with people who genuinely care

456
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:57,490
and respect you and you yourself you are

457
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:59,320
the first person that needs to accept

458
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:00,730
and feel proud of who you are

459
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,470
because you can't look for that

460
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:04,330
validation and other people you got to

461
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:06,430
feel it in your heart girl that

462
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:08,260
upbringing of yours is what molded you

463
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:10,420
to be the person you are today and you

464
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:12,400
have so much to offer I hope this video

465
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:14,380
meant something to you I hope that it

466
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,030
changed your way of thinking a little

467
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:18,430
bit and I hope that is taking you one

468
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:20,170
