00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,580
hey everyone welcome back to my channel

2
00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:08,519
so today I have a pretty unique video I

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,950
did my entire face of makeup using

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:13,110
products that I am getting rid of from

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:15,210
my collection I originally saw this a

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,740
video I think Laura Lee did it on her

7
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,180
channel I don't think I've seen anyone

8
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,560
else do a video like it but I thought it

9
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,480
was a really interesting idea and I

10
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,970
wanted to do it recently in the past few

11
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,460
weeks I've done a huge declutter of my

12
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:29,279
makeup I got rid of a gigantic bag of

13
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,140
makeup to get rid of so some of it was

14
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,790
old that I threw out some of it was

15
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,430
pretty lightly used some of it was never

16
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:37,890
used and some of it was pretty well used

17
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,570
and loved so these are products that I

18
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,640
either wasn't reaching for anymore or

19
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,860
fell out of love with or never loved or

20
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,010
got from boxycharm rip see that I wasn't

21
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,989
really ever gonna use so a lot of the

22
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,120
makeup I did donate I'm gonna be sending

23
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:54,300
out a huge box soon I think I'm gonna be

24
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,399
sending it to Project Beauty share which

25
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,079
is one of the companies that takes

26
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,899
gently use products because I do have a

27
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,520
lot of those so I'm sending them some

28
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:05,070
makeup soon I haven't set out the box

29
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,600
yet I'm also going to be giving away a

30
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,600
lot of the makeup to my friends and

31
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,770
family just anyone who wants to take it

32
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:14,040
but there are some products here that I

33
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:17,189
have that are not good enough to donate

34
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,049
or that I can't donate like for example

35
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:21,960
I can't donate lip products that have

36
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:25,020
been used so stuff like that I can't

37
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,119
donate so I decided to film a full face

38
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,400
of stuff that I'm getting rid of I

39
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,659
actually found a full face of stuff

40
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,869
within the stuff that I was getting rid

41
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:35,909
of so just a disclaimer not all of these

42
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:37,979
products are bad products they're just

43
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:40,740
products that either don't work for me

44
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:42,570
or I just wasn't using anymore some of

45
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,430
these were products that I did really

46
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:47,490
love at some point and I just don't use

47
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,750
them anymore but this is how the makeup

48
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,640
turned out I don't think it looks

49
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,729
horrible I think it looks like okay I

50
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,560
really did try to make a very nice

51
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:57,840
looking makeup like I didn't try to mess

52
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,579
it up on purpose so if you want to see

53
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,590
how I created this look and what

54
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,119
products I will be getting rid of out of

55
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,549
my collection then just keep on watching

56
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,950
I've already moisturized with a little

57
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:09,840
sample of this glam glow glow starter

58
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,319
make illuminating moisturizer and I've

59
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,939
already primed

60
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:14,439
off-camera because I don't have a primer

61
00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:15,909
that I'm getting rid of so first

62
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:18,099
foundation I'm going to be going in if

63
00:02:15,909 --> 00:02:20,260
the Milani conceal imperfect to an one

64
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:22,719
foundation plus concealer in 0-5 warm

65
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:26,469
beige so this is very popular on YouTube

66
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:28,989
over a year ago and people were saying

67
00:02:26,469 --> 00:02:30,700
that it was really amazing and it was

68
00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:33,670
really full coverage and so I picked it

69
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:35,650
up and I tried it and I didn't love it

70
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:38,439
because it did make me throughout the

71
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:41,409
day and any foundation that makes me

72
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:44,319
Olli unless I really really loved it I

73
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:46,599
never wear it I think it's a pretty good

74
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,250
shade match for me so it is quite full

75
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:51,790
coverage you can use it as a concealer

76
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:55,000
like a spot concealer as well I don't

77
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:56,650
really ever do that I forgot to what my

78
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,230
Beauty Blender I'll be right back

79
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:01,180
okay so I'm back with my dirty Beauty

80
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:03,069
Blender I promise I'm washing all of my

81
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,959
brushes after I filmed this video and

82
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:06,430
I'm just gonna blend that out so yeah I

83
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,040
do think this is a pretty good shade

84
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:11,290
match for me and so I did buy it because

85
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,450
it was pretty hyped up at the time and I

86
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:14,280
just never reached for it because it

87
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:16,359
made me

88
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,849
oily throughout the day I mean there are

89
00:03:16,359 --> 00:03:20,769
foundations that also get like that they

90
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:22,449
get oily throughout the day like the

91
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:24,310
Maybelline better skin and the Too Faced

92
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:28,780
Born This Way and the Wet n Wild mega

93
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:30,400
glow whatever that the foundation that

94
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,500
every will have somewhat in wild um but

95
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,449
I love the finish of those so I don't

96
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,220
really mind the fact that I get oily

97
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:38,680
throughout the day wearing it but I just

98
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:40,810
didn't love this foundation on me and it

99
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,579
always kind of felt a little too heavy

100
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,260
so now we're gonna get into concealer

101
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:46,030
and I bought this when I was in London

102
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,470
and I was really excited to use it it is

103
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:50,049
the collection lasting perfection

104
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:51,849
ultimate wear concealer but this is way

105
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:53,349
too light of a shade I don't know why I

106
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:56,889
thought I was a shade like I bought it

107
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:59,889
in store and this is in the shade light

108
00:03:56,889 --> 00:04:01,540
I think fair one why did I do that I

109
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:04,239
think I mut like I must have just

110
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,620
accidentally bought it so it it's way

111
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,299
too light for me so I'm gonna use it

112
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:10,599
today and I actually mix in a little bit

113
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:14,590
of the foundation and use s concealer um

114
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:15,790
and I really it's ridiculous like that's

115
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,109
the reason I'm getting rid of this I

116
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:19,419
really haven't given it a fair shot

117
00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:19,959
because it's so light like that's

118
00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:23,050
ridiculous

119
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:25,300
like that is white I can't believe I

120
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:26,740
bought this like

121
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,479
and I'm annoyed because I really wanted

122
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,340
to try this concealer because I hear

123
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,440
really great things about it okay so now

124
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:34,870
I'm gonna take some of this foundation

125
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:38,590
I'm gonna squeeze it on my hand like a

126
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:40,120
pump and I'm gonna just kind of mix it

127
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:43,150
in there with that so I'm just gonna

128
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:47,319
take the bead blender and blend that out

129
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:49,240
oh my god that looks so light yeah that

130
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:51,190
looks a little crazy underneath my eyes

131
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,780
which is kind of disappointing because I

132
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,880
really want to try this concealer and

133
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,229
they only sell it in Europe and I'm

134
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,080
gonna set that I think with this

135
00:04:56,229 --> 00:05:01,180
covergirl outlast all-day powder

136
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,849
I hate pressed powders so I don't know

137
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:05,319
why I buy them I've gotten rid of almost

138
00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:06,729
all of them my collection here it is

139
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:07,720
yeah it's a finishing powder so you're

140
00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:09,789
not really supposed to it's not really a

141
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,199
foundation powder but I'm just gonna set

142
00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:14,139
that so hopefully that'll darken this up

143
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,370
a little bit this powder I don't think

144
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:17,169
there's anything wrong with it it's just

145
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:19,030
that I hate pressed powder and I don't

146
00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:20,650
know why I buy it I I think in my

147
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:22,389
collection I have like two pressed

148
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:24,759
powders at the moment and I've barely

149
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:27,099
ever used those okay so when I set the

150
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:27,819
concealer with this tinted powder it

151
00:05:27,099 --> 00:05:29,710
looks better

152
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:31,960
I think this powder actually does a nice

153
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:34,000
job is setting under the eyes but I

154
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:37,240
don't know why I hate pressed powder so

155
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,130
much like I always feel it like I'm not

156
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,539
setting my face enough cuz I do like to

157
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,949
use a lot of powder and now I'm gonna

158
00:05:40,539 --> 00:05:44,380
set the rest of my face with this powder

159
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:47,139
and I just feel my face doesn't feel set

160
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:50,080
enough but I think my skin actually

161
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:53,469
looks nice so now let's hop into brows

162
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,599
so here I have this afro eyebrow pencil

163
00:05:53,469 --> 00:05:58,539
and Universal I think it's one of those

164
00:05:55,599 --> 00:05:59,860
like it'll suit any tone um does not

165
00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:02,169
have a spoolie which is kind of annoying

166
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:04,569
I use this brush this brow product for a

167
00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:06,940
while and it's kind of waxy there's

168
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:09,310
nothing really wrong with it it's just

169
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:11,110
not good and I have other brow products

170
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:13,599
that I like way more I think it's also a

171
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:16,419
good color for me there we go that's the

172
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:20,020
brows and then I'm gonna set that with

173
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:23,650
this brow food clear brow enhancing gel

174
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:25,479
fix try think where I got this I think I

175
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:27,969
either got this in a boxy charm or I

176
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:30,729
gotta act generation beauty which is a

177
00:06:27,969 --> 00:06:32,380
beauty convention and I went in New York

178
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:34,839
but I feel like this brow gel just

179
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:37,120
doesn't do anything for me I'm not that

180
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:38,710
it's bad I just think it doesn't do

181
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,550
anything so I got rid of it

182
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:45,580
I don't think it's bad I just I just

183
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:46,840
don't I don't think it's good and I feel

184
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:49,060
like it doesn't do anything to my brows

185
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,710
like it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't

186
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,850
feel like I have anything in my brows so

187
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:54,070
I just kind of got rid of it because I

188
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:55,960
wasn't it didn't do anything okay next

189
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:57,640
for eyeshadow primer I actually do have

190
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,620
an eyeshadow primer that I'm getting rid

191
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:02,020
of this is the Catrice prime and fine

192
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:03,970
brightening eye shadow base intensify

193
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:06,550
any eyeshadow I don't know why I bought

194
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:09,400
this I think I bought this at generation

195
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:10,690
beauty and it was like you can get it

196
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,000
was like five products for twenty

197
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:14,470
dollars I think I just grabbed this so

198
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,130
first of all it feels really kind of

199
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:19,120
like oily which is gross uhm and it is

200
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,980
white

201
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,960
cuz it's supposed to like intensify your

202
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:25,270
eyeshadow that looks a little crazy I

203
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,250
think okay so now for eyeshadow I have

204
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:31,000
two palettes I have the elf mad format

205
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:33,760
palette and the crown glam metals

206
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,620
palette so this elf palette I loved for

207
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,990
a really long time as you can see I hit

208
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:39,850
pan and one of the shades I just never

209
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,230
reach for this anymore so I am getting

210
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:42,910
rid of it but it's not in good enough

211
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:44,890
quality to donate because I have used

212
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:46,030
this shade completely up it's not a bad

213
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:47,620
palette it's a pretty good palette

214
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:49,990
actually I'm gonna take this first shade

215
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:52,360
right here and set the lid with that

216
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:55,480
it's just the base shade trying to

217
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:57,490
neutralize some of that white on my lid

218
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,630
right now I think it looks ridiculous I

219
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:01,540
feel like my eyelids still look really

220
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:03,070
weird and pale I don't like it I really

221
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:06,190
don't like that eyeshadow primer this

222
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:07,480
crown palette I've honestly never used

223
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:08,590
it but I don't want to donate it because

224
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,240
it broke

225
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:13,060
I got in boxycharm so twitty shades

226
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,860
broke when I got it so I'm trying to

227
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:16,570
think what kind of look I'm gonna do I

228
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,250
don't want to do anything too warm so I

229
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:20,110
think I want to use this shade here that

230
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:22,270
I've hit pan in right here it's the

231
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:24,940
fourth one in we're just gonna throw

232
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:28,150
them in the crease um so yeah more about

233
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:30,340
this eyeshadow palette I like it but I

234
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:33,130
think I just have better quality things

235
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:35,590
and I don't use I don't really do all

236
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:36,970
matte eyeshadow Lopes I usually have to

237
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:38,680
use another palette in conjunction with

238
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:40,600
it and this one just wasn't really

239
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,310
cutting it for me I might take a little

240
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,380
bit of this next shade this one right

241
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:46,030
here and also throw that in the crease

242
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:48,420
with the same brush also these

243
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:50,680
eyeshadows aren't the most pigmented

244
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,779
they're pretty good though they're good

245
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,600
for this is a 10

246
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:56,430
my palette so it's pretty good for that

247
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,230
but definitely it's not the best quality

248
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,790
palette in the world but it's definitely

249
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:03,120
it's a good staple especially if you're

250
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:05,579
a beginner and you want a good neutral

251
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,920
matte palette now I'm gonna take this

252
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:09,930
same shade right here the darker one

253
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:13,259
which is right here and I'm gonna take

254
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:16,079
that and just deepen up the crease in a

255
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:18,629
more focused way now I think I'm gonna

256
00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:20,459
take this shade right here and the shade

257
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:23,819
and put it in the outer corner I'm a

258
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:26,129
little bit concerned or nervous about

259
00:09:23,819 --> 00:09:28,740
these darker shades blending out because

260
00:09:26,129 --> 00:09:30,990
darker eyeshadows can get patchy okay

261
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,730
that blended okay honestly as I'm using

262
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:35,009
this palette I'm liking it less and less

263
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,550
I think I just used to really like it

264
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:39,870
before

265
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:43,110
I was extremely into makeup like I used

266
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:45,209
it a lot before like when I was more

267
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,569
starting out my eyeshadow just not look

268
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,100
great

269
00:09:45,569 --> 00:09:49,259
actually and I'm gonna go into this

270
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:52,589
crown palette I as I setting up this in

271
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:56,220
boxycharm I think I'm gonna go in with

272
00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:57,600
Wild Thing just right here I've never

273
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,879
actually used this palette and I'm gonna

274
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:04,439
take out my ring finger and put that on

275
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:07,079
the outer half of my lid umm this

276
00:10:04,439 --> 00:10:09,149
palette is also just not very exciting

277
00:10:07,079 --> 00:10:11,699
to me besides the fact that it broke

278
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:14,129
I just don't picture myself using it

279
00:10:11,699 --> 00:10:16,199
because these aren't really shades I

280
00:10:14,129 --> 00:10:18,329
would use that much I'm also gonna take

281
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:20,160
rebel which is this middle shade on my

282
00:10:18,329 --> 00:10:22,920
middle finger and put that on the inner

283
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,470
part of the lid okay color doesn't

284
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:27,629
really go with this look but it's a nice

285
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:29,040
color actually I just think this palette

286
00:10:27,629 --> 00:10:33,059
is kind of a weird palette if there's

287
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,139
like it's like these shimmers just like

288
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:39,170
don't really make sense they're not

289
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:41,399
vibrant and like nice kind of like dull

290
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:42,750
shimmers if that makes any sense I don't

291
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:45,420
really have an eyeliner so I'm just

292
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:47,279
gonna do regular winged eyeliner with a

293
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:49,679
liquid eyeliner off-camera and I'll be

294
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,139
back to do the rest of the makeup okay

295
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:53,939
so now I'm gonna set my eyeliner with

296
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:55,920
this black shade in the elf palette I

297
00:10:53,939 --> 00:10:57,899
always do that it's like an essential

298
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,779
step for me and then in the upper

299
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:01,309
waterline I'm going to take this ciate

300
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:04,079
Wunderland

301
00:11:01,309 --> 00:11:04,830
wonder what notes wonder wand CIT london

302
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,080
wonder wand

303
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:10,860
Kjell coal liner I think I got this in

304
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:12,960
if C or boxycharm so it is a gel liner

305
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:16,080
on one end and then this is weird like

306
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,640
angled brush I guess to blend it out but

307
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:20,160
I don't know it doesn't really make any

308
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:22,680
sense to me so this is pretty black

309
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,050
there it is washed right there um this

310
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:28,410
is some other stuff ignore that um but I

311
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:31,670
don't think that stays my waterline it

312
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:34,260
goes on pretty black but it smudges

313
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:35,970
pretty quickly and then I don't have a

314
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,350
mascara that I'm giving away so I'm

315
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:39,090
gonna do that off camera and I'll be

316
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:40,380
back for like bronzer blush and

317
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:42,540
highlight and that kind of stuff I

318
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:44,700
almost forgot about fitting shadow on

319
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:47,580
the lower lash line so I think I'm gonna

320
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:49,740
take this shade right here and put that

321
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:52,710
on the lower lash line I feel like since

322
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:54,690
this is more of like a dark and kind of

323
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:57,420
smoky eye shadow look I'm gonna make the

324
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:59,010
lower lash line a little bit more dark

325
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:02,400
and then I'm gonna blend that out with

326
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:04,680
the shade that I hit panning okay so the

327
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,870
eye look is done I feel like it's very

328
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:09,300
okay it's not great I don't love it but

329
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:10,920
it's there it's on my eyes now for

330
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,450
bronzer this might be a product that is

331
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,670
a little bit surprising to you guys and

332
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:16,740
this is the Tarte Park a princess

333
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:18,210
bronzer this is a deluxe sized sample I

334
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,610
had this product in my collection for a

335
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:22,920
while and I just I never used it I never

336
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:24,840
loved it it wasn't my favorite thing

337
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,970
ever I know a lot of people love this

338
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,920
bronzer this one does have a little bit

339
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:31,230
more of a sheen to it and I've tried

340
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:33,690
using this and I love bronzer and this

341
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:35,670
one for some reason I never wanted to I

342
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:39,930
never was reaching for I never wanted to

343
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:42,590
use it nothing about it like excites me

344
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:45,420
so it just kind of sat in my collection

345
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:48,570
never being used and then for blush I

346
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:51,000
have the Hikari tingle blush this I got

347
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:53,070
an Ipsy a long time ago this is quite an

348
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,590
old blush as you can see it's extremely

349
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:56,970
bright and I did keep this in my

350
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:58,890
collection for a while and I was using

351
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:00,900
it sometimes I wasn't using it that much

352
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:02,910
so I decided to get rid of it but I'm

353
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,800
just gonna take with a very light hand I

354
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:06,270
think it's pretty it's just I never was

355
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,010
reaching for it because it's so bright

356
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:11,190
and then for highlighter I have this

357
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:13,380
city color highlight trio I use this a

358
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:15,930
lot for a really long time I got it in

359
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:17,790
epsy I'm pretty sure and I just I'm

360
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:19,380
getting rid of it now because I never

361
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:21,030
use anymore and I do have highlighters

362
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,950
that I like more than this but it

363
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:24,840
definitely isn't a bad product by any

364
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:26,730
means I'm gonna take this middle shade

365
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,710
and this I'm gonna take these two shades

366
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:30,900
this one's more pinky you can't really

367
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:32,460
tell I don't think because my camera is

368
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,470
watching it out a little bit there we go

369
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:37,020
um so this is more pinky this is more

370
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:38,490
white and I'm gonna mix those two it's

371
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:41,040
pretty you can definitely see the

372
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:43,410
highlight I just wasn't reaching for it

373
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,880
and I have so many highlighters that I

374
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:49,100
didn't need to keep this one okay and

375
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:52,290
lastly for lips I have this MDM flow

376
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:54,210
retro liquid lipstick I don't think I've

377
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:56,190
ever really worn this but I did swatch

378
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:58,110
it and I probably put it on my lips just

379
00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:01,980
to see the color so I can't donate it

380
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:03,360
anymore cuz it's not brand new but this

381
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:05,820
is a liquid lipstick I'm pretty sure I

382
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,550
got an Ipsy and it's just kind of random

383
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:11,640
and I had colors similar to it it's a

384
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:13,680
pretty pink color let me put it on now

385
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,970
it's quite pigmented I feel like this

386
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,520
doesn't really go with my look either

387
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:21,930
it's very bright lip compared to my very

388
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:23,340
cool toned eye it's a fine product I

389
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:26,610
don't really like to smell it kind of

390
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:30,090
smells like plastic but it's drying down

391
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:33,390
it's getting very sticky which means

392
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:35,190
it'll probably dry down completely matte

393
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:36,900
once it's done so I'm gonna wait a few

394
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:39,000
minutes for this to completely dry down

395
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:40,350
okay so the liquid lipstick hasn't dried

396
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,960
down completely but I'm just kind of

397
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:45,480
noticing something as I'm pressing my

398
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:47,400
lips together and pulling them apart the

399
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:50,040
product is like lifting from my lips I'm

400
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:52,080
not sure if you can tell but I keep

401
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:54,680
going like that and then now there's

402
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:57,240
like a whole of product on my mouth

403
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:59,550
which is really weird I'm not sure if

404
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:02,160
you can see it but it's right that

405
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:03,630
there's like product missing it's really

406
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,920
weird I don't like that I'm gonna try to

407
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:06,570
put a little bit more on I don't really

408
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:09,660
want to layer this I don't like this

409
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:11,400
liquid lipstick either yeah I'm happy

410
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:13,980
I'm getting rid of it um yeah I really

411
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,960
don't like it at all okay so this is the

412
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:18,000
finished makeup look full of products

413
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:20,370
that I am getting rid of getting out of

414
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,300
my collection I think the makeup ended

415
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:26,010
okay I actually think it looks better

416
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:28,050
all put together than it did before

417
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:29,670
I will do a little close-up now so

418
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:31,590
here's the face all closed up the

419
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:34,260
eyebrows look pretty good I think

420
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:35,760
looks pretty good um the eyeshadow I

421
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:39,000
think the eyeshadow honestly looks

422
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:42,870
patchy and didn't blend really well and

423
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,370
this lip is just super weird it's still

424
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:48,120
kind of sticky I didn't want to wait for

425
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:49,680
it to dry down completely but I just

426
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,720
don't like it I don't really like the

427
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,490
way it feels um I think my skin feels

428
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,780
kind of heavy

429
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:56,970
because of the foundation and the powder

430
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:58,440
