everyone calls me Sophie also no one

30
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,900
ever knows how to pronounce my last name

31
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,810
it's really easy it's literally how it's

32
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,759
written just say des I was born in New

33
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:24,119
York City I was born in Manhattan I

34
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:28,409
moved to New Jersey when I was six years

35
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:30,960
old my birthday is March 15 1999 and

36
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:33,450
that makes me a Pisces I don't really

37
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,619
follow like astrological signs and stuff

38
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,710
like that or I don't read my horoscope

39
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:39,090
but I'm a Pisces and that would make me

40
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,579
18 years old

41
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,259
I have one brother Bennet you probably

42
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:46,020
know him if you watch my vlogs he's

43
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:48,689
always in them also I have a dog his

44
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,180

00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,000
put that together it's Ben and Jerry

48
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:59,280
like the ice cream so my brother and my

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,950

50
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,079

66
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:43,579
as much I actually want to be a criminal

00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:46,010
lawyer when I grow up as of right now

68
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:47,959

00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:50,569

00:02:52,969 --> 00:02:57,159
I'm planning on doing like NYU related

73
00:02:55,219 --> 00:02:59,389

74
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:03,379

00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:08,269
have seen her and some videos on my

77
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:10,069
channel before I love her very much

00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:12,019
and she has her own YouTube channel so

79
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:14,180
go check her out so I actually started

80
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:16,400
doing makeup when I was in seventh grade

81
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:17,930
my mom found that we do makeup and it

82
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,310
was it was a whole mess I didn't know

83
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:21,590
what I was doing I liked her blue

84
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:23,930
eyeliner a lot it was not a good look

85
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:25,729
I'm sorry I like blue eyeliner and eye

86
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:28,489
shadow or like purple and I drew school

87
00:03:25,729 --> 00:03:30,620
like every single day it was so bad but

88
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:32,150
I didn't really get like really serious

89
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:34,699
and to makeup until I was in tenth grade

90
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:36,139
I still wasn't that good but that's

91
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:39,530
really when I started like building my

92
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:41,000
collection and just learning a lot more

93
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:43,280
about how to do my makeup and that kind

94
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,319
of stuff so when I was a freshman in

95
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,540
high school I was super into doing nail

96
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:49,639
art I mean I wasn't super great at it

97
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:52,639
but I loved doing it like I would spend

98
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:54,650
like two hours painting my nails doing

99
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:57,590
like different things like I painted

100
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:59,569
cupcakes on my nails I think I did like

101
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:01,250
little cows on my nails ones I don't

102
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:02,840
know super into it I don't really do it

103
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,879
anymore and now I just like get my nail

104
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,349
done and I do gel or I just paint my

105
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,709
normal nails but I have a pretty big

106
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:12,919
nail polish collection also I am 5 foot

107
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:15,859
5 I'm technically 5 foot 4 and 3/4 but I

108
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:19,909
just say I'm 5 foot 5 I have broken two

109
00:04:15,859 --> 00:04:22,219
bones before I broke my left wrist when

110
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:24,300
I was in second grade and I also broke

111
00:04:22,219 --> 00:04:25,500
one of my ankle I don't

112
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,110
literally don't remember which angle

113
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,840
stood my left on my right but I broke

114
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:32,220
that in 5th grade I also got a

115
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,340
concussion freshman year of high school

116
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:37,229
and I hit my head on my wall and I got a

117
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,849
like relatively minor concussion I was

118
00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:40,889
out of school for a week but yes I hit

119
00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:43,949
my head on my own bedroom wall and I got

120
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:46,259
a concussion I have never had braces I

121
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:48,629
used to have like one of those like

122
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:49,889
permanent retainers on my bottom teeth

123
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:52,710
and then on the top

124
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:54,150
I had this retainer that I never wore so

125
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,470
my teeth just like straightened out on

126
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:58,110
their own I don't know how that happened

127
00:04:55,470 --> 00:05:00,719
but they did so I got glasses when I was

128
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:02,219
8 years old and now I just wear contacts

129
00:05:00,719 --> 00:05:04,560
I got contacts in middle school and I

130
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:06,030
hate wearing my glasses I rarely wear

131
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,069
them I just wear contacts basically

132
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:10,500
every single day I have a really bad

133
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:12,270
habit of biting my nails so that's

134
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,039
honestly why I always have nail polish

135
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,389
on my nails because otherwise my nail

136
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:18,810
pleasure is off I'll bite my nails

137
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:21,210

269
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:27,660

278
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:45,569
so much though my favorite season is

279
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:47,009
fall and then I also like winter and

280
00:10:45,569 --> 00:10:49,050
then my third favorite season is summer

281
00:10:47,009 --> 00:10:52,649
and then I hate spring and that is

282
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:53,939
because I am allergic to pollen and I I

283
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:56,100
used have really really really bad

284
00:10:53,939 --> 00:10:57,990
pollen allergies and now they're not as

285
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:01,559

289
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,140
and like color coding definite stuff but

290
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:15,750
at the same time I'm not like super like

291
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:17,460
I'm not super super super clean because

292
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,650
I need a lot of time to organize a long

293
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:21,030
time I don't have time so then things

294
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:23,820
kind of get like a little messy I

295
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:26,040
wouldn't say I'm a messy person but I'm

296
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,840
not like super clean but like when I get

297
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,960
the chance I love to organize like my

298
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:32,430
books on my shelf are alphabetized they

299
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:35,130
love color coding things that kind of

300
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:38,040
stuff yes I love it all right so those

301
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:40,080
