1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:03,990
I'm getting so sweaty I'm so hot right

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:05,640
now I'm like my nipple pasty imma

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,140
nowhere why am I wearing these nipple

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,059
pasty it's so hard

5
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:18,779
there's no a/c in this room as you guys

6
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:22,170
know okay anyways let's continue welcome

7
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:24,660
back to my channel today I am reshooting

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,400
this Q&A for those of you who have

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,170
submitted your questions about a month

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,599
ago you're probably wondering girl

11
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,329
where's the video so I filmed this video

12
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,340
about a month ago and I just I was just

13
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:37,140
filming off that day overall I just was

14
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,140
not happy with the video and I thought

15
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,540
maybe I just need to reshoot it so today

16
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,450
I am in a very positive mood I'm feeling

17
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,430
good so let's tackle this Q&A I wrote

18
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,170
down all the questions in my journal

19
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,840
what is the greatest growth you've

20
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,399
experienced in the past year there there

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,410
are so many layers to this question

22
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,079
because I feel like as human beings we

23
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:01,079
all grow and evolve so much every year

24
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,660
I've grown as a person as an individual

25
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:08,159
I've grown a lot as a partner to wall

26
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:10,020
I've grown a lot as like a dog mom and a

27
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,970
daughter I've just grown in a lot of

28
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,030
areas I guess I'm just finding more of

29
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:17,790
my own voice and my own confidence in

30
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:20,220
the last year I feel like I've learned

31
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,680
to be more just like forward about how I

32
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:25,170
feel and if I didn't agree to something

33
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,240
or I felt differently about something I

34
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,729
would just voice it and not worry about

35
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,890
how the other person may perceive it

36
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:33,750
because that's just kind of who I was

37
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,909
all the time I've always been worried

38
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,890
about coming off the wrong way to people

39
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:40,860
but in the last year I've realized that

40
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,479
if I'm just being myself and I'm being

41
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,299
the best version of myself in the most

42
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,399
honest version of myself however I come

43
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:48,899
off to another person that's just the

44
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,479
way that they're gonna perceive me but

45
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:54,030
that's not the truth of Who I am you

46
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:57,329
know I feel more confident in expressing

47
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,280
how I feel and I don't feel like I need

48
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:01,920
to be apologetic for who I want to be

49
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,509
and I don't feel as much of a pressure

50
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,030
of living up to other people's

51
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:09,270
expectations another example that I can

52
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:11,610
share is I grew up on YouTube pretty

53
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,950
much I was 15 when I made my first video

54
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,480
I was very very young

55
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:16,280
and even though it's very young at the

56
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,410
time a lot of people who watched me were

57
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,819
even younger than me and at the time I

58
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:21,260
remember a lot of people would say

59
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:22,970
things like I really look up to you

60
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,970
you're like the big sister I never had

61
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:29,120
and I always go to you for advice and

62
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:32,390
everything and I think with that I took

63
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,910
a lot of kind of responsibility about

64
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:37,519
the way that I would appear on YouTube

65
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:39,530
and I was still being myself but there

66
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,799
was that sense of where I always have to

67
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:44,810
do right by other people and that I

68
00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:45,590
can't let people down and I can't make

69
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,959
mistakes

70
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:49,610
that's like one example I think in the

71
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:51,470
last year I've learned that there are a

72
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:52,910
lot of people who will try to tell me

73
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,750
like hey Whaley like I don't like the

74
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:55,280
way you're thinking

75
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:57,110
or I feel like you shouldn't have said

76
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,880
that and immediately I'd be like oh my

77
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,950
god I knew I shouldn't have said that

78
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,680
like I really made a mistake but

79
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:07,489
sometimes those truly are my opinions

80
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,709
and I think I've really learned that I

81
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:11,569
don't need to share all of my opinions

82
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:13,489
even if I feel strongly about something

83
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:16,010
there's just a time and a place for it

84
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:17,810
not that I'm saying I'm silencing myself

85
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:20,239
but I realized that there are a lot of

86
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:21,889
opinions out there and if I feel

87
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,829
strongly about mine and I don't want

88
00:03:21,889 --> 00:03:26,329
someone to tell me otherwise I think the

89
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:27,950
best thing to do is just keep those

90
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:30,019
opinions to myself and like just let

91
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:33,380
myself process it and grow from it

92
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:35,060
instead of having it being like a public

93
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:37,489
thing does that make sense I've grown a

94
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:40,549
lot as far as just really letting myself

95
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:42,950
be human and like letting myself have an

96
00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:45,889
opinion and not feel like I am

97
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:48,170
responsible for everyone else or how

98
00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:50,480
other people perceive me because I just

99
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:52,220
need to do right by myself so yeah

100
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,769
that's like the biggest growth I think

101
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:57,319
for myself and I'll talk a little bit

102
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:58,819
more about like my growth in my

103
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:00,620
relationship with wah - because that's

104
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:02,450
actually one of the other questions but

105
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,819
yeah hope that answers the first

106
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:07,010
question how have you been supporting

107
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:08,750
local the past few weeks I've been

108
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:10,730
trying to support local mom-and-pop

109
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:12,230
restaurants as much as I can or actually

110
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:13,280
that's actually all I've been doing like

111
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:14,900
there was a day where I was really

112
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,150
craving Shake Shack but I'm like let me

113
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,799
just spend my money on like a local

114
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:21,169
burger joint instead of Shake Shack

115
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:23,270
because Shake Shack will survive but

116
00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:25,520
maybe not the mom-and-pop shop you know

117
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:26,630
but you know I thought the soup

118
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,400
plantation would survive

119
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:30,830
through it all but I just heard that

120
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,300
Souplantation is not gonna make it which

121
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,800
is just really really devastating

122
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,080
because it's like one of my favorite

123
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,990
salad bars they have like such good

124
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,150
prices such good quality all right piece

125
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:43,700
of vision we did launch our shop small

126
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:45,200
campaign which I'm so proud of on woman

127
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:48,050
if you guys missed it just to give you

128
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,790
like a little idea of what it was when

129
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:52,970
the whole pandemic first started we were

130
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:54,260
like okay this is crazy but we also were

131
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:56,360
aware that a lot of other small

132
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:58,520
businesses like us are taking a huge hit

133
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,110
so we thought like okay what are some

134
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,000
small businesses that we love that are

135
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:03,860
local that we can collaborate with and

136
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,870
support each other during this time so

137
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,430
we launched our shop small campaign and

138
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:10,340
I feel like that's what woman has always

139
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:11,990
been about for me where I mean obviously

140
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:14,240
we have our own brand but how do we

141
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:15,740
expand ourselves beyond that you know

142
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,110
how do we connect with our community and

143
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:20,240
other women and I think the shop small

144
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:22,850
campaign really just like hit hit like

145
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,220
the it hit like the jackpot or like it

146
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:27,830
really is exactly what I would envision

147
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:29,960
women to be so I was really proud that

148
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:33,500
we did that so that's another way we've

149
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:35,030
been supporting small businesses and I

150
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,620
think that's about it I think like you

151
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,120
know the best ways that you can if

152
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:40,070
you're wondering like how you can help

153
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,360
support your local community is just

154
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:43,400
whenever you're about to make a purchase

155
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,350
think about do I really need to buy this

156
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:48,320
item at Target or can I find it at like

157
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:50,900
a smaller mom-and-pop local market or a

158
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:54,380
restaurant do you let your dogs on your

159
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:56,570
bed um I think if I didn't live with wah

160
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:59,240
I probably would let the dogs on the bed

161
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:01,460
I used to always actually like growing

162
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,630
up our dogs were allowed on the bed here

163
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,400
and there as long as they were cleaning

164
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:06,050
obviously if they're muddy they're not

165
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,850
gonna be allowed on the bed you would

166
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:10,250
think after so many years he'd build an

167
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:12,590
immunity to it but no he's still really

168
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:14,510
allergic to them so anytime they lay on

169
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:16,340
the bed and if the dogs laid on his

170
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:18,350
pillow or on the sheets like he would

171
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:20,330
get really really severe allergies from

172
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:21,860
it so because of that we don't usually

173
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,210
let the dogs on the bed but we also

174
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,950
learned from our trainer that you have

175
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:26,600
to set these boundaries with your pets

176
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:27,740
once in a while we'll like if they're

177
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,180
clean and they have just been bathed

178
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,890
we'll let them on the bed for like a

179
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:34,130
little bit but they sleep on their own

180
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:36,080
beds we have like so many dog beds so

181
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:37,610
they're comfortable and I think it's

182
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,290
kind of nice having that balance our

183
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,100
bedrooms really small so we have a

184
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,930
queen-size matter

185
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,120
which is a decent size but if you put

186
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:45,950
two full-sized humans on a queen-size

187
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,750
mattress and you put three more dogs on

188
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:49,550
top of that that's just like too much so

189
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,770
yeah to answer your question they don't

190
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:54,170
sleep on the bed and we let them

191
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:55,940
sometimes how is woman doing during this

192
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:58,820
difficult time if I'm being completely

193
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:01,190
honest we like most small businesses are

194
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:04,100
not doing so well I am hopeful that

195
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:06,470
things will get better and yeah I I

196
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:08,330
don't I don't know I don't really know

197
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:09,980
how to answer that because I feel so

198
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:11,720
fortunate and lucky that we're in a

199
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:14,570
position where we're still able to stay

200
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,370
afloat for now and I know there are so

201
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:20,660
many businesses who are closing down and

202
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:22,940
I just I don't even know what to say

203
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:24,680
like I feel like you know we're doing

204
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,210
okay I don't want to sit here and say

205
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,820
like oh we're doing great when we're not

206
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:30,200
but yeah we're doing okay and I'm just

207
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:32,630
grateful for what it is right now

208
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:35,180
I am just hopeful that things will get

209
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:38,090
better I am very excited for our summer

210
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:39,680
collection and we just have new ideas

211
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:41,570
for the company that hopefully will be

212
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,060
more exciting for you guys but for now

213
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:46,760
I'm very grateful and glad that we're

214
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:49,190
not closing down it is a very scary

215
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,330
thing to think about but yeah I don't

216
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:52,880
know I don't know what the future holds

217
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:56,390
and if the pandemic continues to go on

218
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:58,010
for who knows how long I think us along

219
00:07:56,390 --> 00:08:00,170
with a lot of small businesses we would

220
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:02,900
really be struggling but as of now we're

221
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:04,310
trying our best and I'm I'm just hopeful

222
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,320
I think I'm just being optimistic about

223
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:08,000
the future and I want to say thank you

224
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,860
to all of you who supported our shop

225
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,780
small campaign or are continuing to

226
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:15,350
support us it really really means a lot

227
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:17,300
and yeah thank you how do you cope with

228
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:19,490
the lockdown how do you stay positive

229
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:21,110
I've been reading a lot more self-help

230
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:23,390
books during this time and I think

231
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:25,190
that's been very helpful in the

232
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:27,950
beginning when all of this kind of first

233
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:30,680
went down I was watching the news a lot

234
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:32,960
and I think that kind of drove me into

235
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:36,260
like a state of panic and just worry and

236
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:38,479
anxiety and now I've just lessened the

237
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:40,039
amount of the news I'm watching because

238
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,500
I realize like that was kind of the

239
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:44,210
source of me feeling so stressed so I

240
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,580
think if you're feeling very stressed

241
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:48,800
out and worried and you happen to be

242
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,600
watching the news a lot I would say like

243
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,490
first start by just cutting that down a

244
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,390
little bit I know it's important to stay

245
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,790
informed

246
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:57,710
you can't just like overwhelm yourself

247
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:58,970
with information you know because a lot

248
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:01,820
of the information right now is very

249
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:04,670
scary and very negative so the best

250
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:06,560
advice that I can give is that you just

251
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:08,180
have to keep trying and keep believing

252
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,310
and being optimistic about life like

253
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:12,350
whenever anything bad happens to me or

254
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:14,000
like in life in general I feel like

255
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:15,620
there are just two ways you can look at

256
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,050
the situation you know you can either

257
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:20,900
take the route where you crumble and you

258
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:22,910
fall into fear and anxiety or you can

259
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,510
take the higher Road where you can try

260
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,640
your best

261
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:27,530
to be optimistic and positive about the

262
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,810
situation I think naturally our minds

263
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:31,790
are just geared more towards like having

264
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:33,710
negative thoughts it's a lot harder to

265
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:35,000
convince yourself to be positive and

266
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:37,880
keep pushing forward

267
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,560
but if whatever is happening to you or

268
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:42,260
whatever is happening right now is

269
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:44,810
happening regardless would you rather

270
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:46,550
make yourself continue to go down a

271
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:48,590
deeper hole or would you rather push

272
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:50,870
yourself to get out of the hole I think

273
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:52,670
that is like the best advice that I can

274
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:55,100
give any time you're faced with any

275
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:56,780
challenges there are always two ways to

276
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:59,150
look at a situation one thing my dad

277
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:00,680
said to me years ago that I still carry

278
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:02,270
with me till this day which is very

279
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,070
surprising because I don't really talk

280
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:06,110
to my dad that much but one thing my dad

281
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:08,150
said to me years ago that really stuck

282
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:10,820
was that as long as you keep trying it's

283
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:12,890
not over and when he said that it made

284
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:15,590
me really think like wow like as long as

285
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:18,410
I don't give up there is still a chance

286
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:20,870
I carry that with me for a lot of things

287
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:23,270
in life whenever I feel like damn like

288
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:25,250
this really sucks or like damn how do I

289
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:27,200
get out of this I remind myself that as

290
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:29,300
long as I don't give up there's still a

291
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,890
chance whatever you're going through no

292
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,690
matter how shitty the situation is right

293
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:34,400
now you are not alone and that things

294
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:36,410
will eventually get better because if it

295
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,300
doesn't it's not the end just surround

296
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:40,340
yourself with positive people if you can

297
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,650
and if you are around people that are

298
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:44,630
really negative during this time try to

299
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:46,610
be the light in their life you know it's

300
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:47,960
easy to just like fall into that I used

301
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:49,400
to be that type of person to when like

302
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,980
I'm around someone that's just negative

303
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,600
I will absorb all of that energy and I

304
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:55,130
will just be negative with them but I

305
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,510
realized that I would rather be the

306
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:58,370
light in someone's life and even though

307
00:10:56,510 --> 00:11:00,680
it's hard to try to be that positive

308
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:02,870
person just be that person's light you

309
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:05,200
know like if you can be the positive

310
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:07,070
person in this situation and you can see

311
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,320
beyond the negative

312
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:11,690
right now why not help that person get

313
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,910
there so try your best not to let other

314
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:15,440
people's negativity whether that be in

315
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:17,900
your household or your roommates right

316
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,000
now bring you down try to be the light

317
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,800
in their life and I'm sure that one day

318
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,570
they will appreciate it and that one day

319
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,010
they will see what you've done for them

320
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:26,810
and that one day they will be that light

321
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:27,950
for you what are some things you realize

322
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:30,950
you could live without during this

323
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:33,380
quarantine well this is finally a

324
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:35,890
lighter question I've realized that I

325
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:39,640
can live without my eyelash extensions I

326
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:41,960
realized that I don't have to get mine

327
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:44,540
we're just gonna wait I realize that I

328
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:47,330
can do my own nails I mean I've always

329
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:49,100
known that I can do it but of course you

330
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:50,900
know it's nice getting your nails done

331
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,700
just like I think a lot of like the

332
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:55,010
maintenance things that I would use to

333
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,960
do you know I think I can definitely

334
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:58,130
live without those things I've always

335
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,900
been able to live without those things

336
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:01,640
but you know what I'm saying oh I can

337
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,260
live without going to coffee shops yeah

338
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,790
that's another big one because I would

339
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:06,470
always go to coffee shops it was just

340
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:08,450
more of the experience I really enjoy

341
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:11,240
the experience of like meeting up with a

342
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:12,800
friend at a coffee shop but I also spent

343
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,810
a lot of money on coffee shops you know

344
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,870
and I can make my own lattes and I make

345
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:19,610
some really Bond lattes shout-out to men

346
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:23,210
espresso machine what jobs have you had

347
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:25,880
before or while starting youtube so if

348
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:27,680
you guys are like ogee viewers you

349
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,960
probably have known of every single job

350
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,610
of mine but let's go down the list so my

351
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:35,060
first job ever was actually on my

352
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:37,250
parents restaurant and if you group saw

353
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:38,630
something and some people may think like

354
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:41,840
oh well you worked my parents it's not

355
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:44,570
really a real job no bish it was a real

356
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:47,030
job like my sister and I legit ran the

357
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:48,320
restaurant and we learned the ins and

358
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:50,060
outs of how to run a restaurant

359
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,380
obviously like a small restaurant it's

360
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,720
not like a big chain restaurant it was

361
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:55,940
like a local mom-and-pop Chinese

362
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:58,250
restaurant and I seriously grew up in

363
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:59,660
that restaurant at the time I hated it

364
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,970
and I was really embarrassed by it

365
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:03,230
because every summer all the other kids

366
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:05,390
at school would be going on family

367
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:06,770
vacations but for me summer vacation

368
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:08,270
meant that I would go and work at the

369
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:10,160
restaurant and I remember I would used

370
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:11,300
to lie to my friends at school and I

371
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,190
would say like oh yeah my parents are

372
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,630
taking me to Disneyland oh yeah we're

373
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:17,090
gonna go here and there but in reality

374
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:18,410
literally the day after school ended I

375
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:19,379
would be working at the restaurant all

376
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:21,239
summer long

377
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:24,689
and at the time I really hated it but I

378
00:13:21,239 --> 00:13:27,029
think like that whole experience I'm so

379
00:13:24,689 --> 00:13:28,289
grateful that my parents had me and my

380
00:13:27,029 --> 00:13:30,359
sister work at a restaurant at such a

381
00:13:28,289 --> 00:13:31,949
young age I was 8 when we first started

382
00:13:30,359 --> 00:13:34,410
we had the restaurant up until I was

383
00:13:31,949 --> 00:13:35,939
like 13 and we worked we worked at the

384
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:38,429
restaurant pretty much every single day

385
00:13:35,939 --> 00:13:40,529
after school obviously after we did our

386
00:13:38,429 --> 00:13:43,949
homework and stuff but that was my life

387
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:45,959
from 8 through 13 almost every single

388
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:48,239
day I had school and then I had a job

389
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:49,499
afterwards and my parents weren't like

390
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:51,569
the type of parents where they were just

391
00:13:49,499 --> 00:13:53,549
like letting us kind of slack off we

392
00:13:51,569 --> 00:13:55,529
actually had to really run the

393
00:13:53,549 --> 00:13:57,239
restaurant take all the phone calls pack

394
00:13:55,529 --> 00:13:59,489
all the orders take care of all the

395
00:13:57,239 --> 00:14:00,959
customers I would come in and I remember

396
00:13:59,489 --> 00:14:02,369
at the time like people would just kind

397
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,599
of laugh because they would see me and

398
00:14:02,369 --> 00:14:04,859
my sister behind the counter and they

399
00:14:03,599 --> 00:14:06,419
would think like Oh like what did these

400
00:14:04,859 --> 00:14:08,519
little kids know but in the end they

401
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:09,839
would always be so impressed by the way

402
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:13,319
my sister and I handled the whole

403
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:15,329
restaurant and yeah like I grew so much

404
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:17,789
until this day I look back to that

405
00:14:15,329 --> 00:14:19,470
experience and think about how much that

406
00:14:17,789 --> 00:14:21,179
whole experience of working at my

407
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:23,069
parents restaurant has molded me as a

408
00:14:21,179 --> 00:14:25,859
person today so that was my first job

409
00:14:23,069 --> 00:14:28,229
and then after that my parents opened a

410
00:14:25,859 --> 00:14:30,209
flower shop I was the delivery girl so

411
00:14:28,229 --> 00:14:32,129
some of you guys may remember some of

412
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:33,569
the vlogs from back then where I would

413
00:14:32,129 --> 00:14:35,609
deliver flowers I think I deleted those

414
00:14:33,569 --> 00:14:37,049
blogs already but yeah I delivered

415
00:14:35,609 --> 00:14:38,879
flowers from my parents for quite a few

416
00:14:37,049 --> 00:14:40,769
years and then at one point most of my

417
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:43,019
friends worked for my parents and they

418
00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:44,549
all delivered flowers too and then wall

419
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:47,309
worked at the flower shop too so it was

420
00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:50,579
like a family and friends business so

421
00:14:47,309 --> 00:14:52,769
that was my second job experience and

422
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:55,139
then when I was in college I worked

423
00:14:52,769 --> 00:14:57,149
retail at Victoria's Secret I didn't

424
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:59,039
work there for very long but I was there

425
00:14:57,149 --> 00:15:01,139
during college just to make some monies

426
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:03,659
and I remember at the time when I first

427
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:05,609
received the call from the person who

428
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:08,669
interviewed me she was like hey you got

429
00:15:05,609 --> 00:15:11,639
the job is $10 per hour okay and I was

430
00:15:08,669 --> 00:15:13,379
like yeah I felt so proud because it was

431
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:14,669
like my first job outside of working for

432
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:17,039
my parents I didn't care how much the

433
00:15:14,669 --> 00:15:18,509
pay was but ten dollars an hour was not

434
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:20,309
bad and I worked at the San Francisco

435
00:15:18,509 --> 00:15:22,169
Union Square location so being in a big

436
00:15:20,309 --> 00:15:23,729
city the pay was higher too compared to

437
00:15:22,169 --> 00:15:25,529
the suburbs I lived in I think at the

438
00:15:23,729 --> 00:15:27,449
time minimum wage was like eight

439
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:29,159
something in the town that I grew up in

440
00:15:27,449 --> 00:15:32,009
but working in San Francisco is getting

441
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:33,010
paid $10 an hour so I was like yeah or

442
00:15:32,009 --> 00:15:35,110
was it $9

443
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:36,790
somewhere between their $9 or $10 and

444
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:39,370
then while I was in college I interned

445
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:40,690
for Stila cosmetics which was a really

446
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,579
really cool experience I was really

447
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:45,579
proud of that experience because it was

448
00:15:42,579 --> 00:15:47,529
like my first corporate job so I was

449
00:15:45,579 --> 00:15:49,990
interning and I was doing like customer

450
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:51,519
service for Stila so just answering a

451
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:53,350
lot of emails and stuff like that and I

452
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,680
had a supervisor who I would help her

453
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:58,660
like pack orders and stuff so yeah and

454
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:01,600
that kind of pretty much catches me up

455
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:03,430
to date and then after college I wanted

456
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,920
to work corporate that's what I majored

457
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:07,300
in infinim I wanted to do like product

458
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,279
development or something like that for a

459
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,050
beauty company but I ended up just

460
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,899
taking YouTube full-time because right

461
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:15,850
after I graduated I think I got my first

462
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:19,029
big like opportunity with Bobby Brown

463
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:20,139
and that I think was like kind of like a

464
00:16:19,029 --> 00:16:22,180
wake-up call for me where I was like

465
00:16:20,139 --> 00:16:24,160
this could actually be my career like I

466
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:26,589
can't believe a big company like Bobby

467
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,470
Brown would ever come across my channel

468
00:16:26,589 --> 00:16:31,449
and want to film I campaign with me so I

469
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:33,100
thought like there is definitely value

470
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:35,699
in this so like let's see where this

471
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:38,410
takes me so I was faced with either

472
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:41,079
continuing to get my bachelor's which

473
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:42,459
would have been another 60 grand or take

474
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:45,639
you to full-time and just start working

475
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:47,380
so I decided to start working um are you

476
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:49,600
baking and have you been experimenting

477
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:51,910
in the kitchen I've been seeing like

478
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,130
literally everyone I follow bake during

479
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:55,839
this quarantine and I haven't gotten

480
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:58,149
into it because to be honest I don't

481
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,829
really have a sweet tooth I don't really

482
00:16:58,149 --> 00:17:02,290
like eating sweets it's just not my

483
00:16:59,829 --> 00:17:04,209
thing I'm more of like a savory tooth I

484
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:05,650
like it when people bake for me you know

485
00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:07,270
like if if my friends brought me over

486
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:09,189
like a brownie or something like I'm all

487
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:10,900
for it but yeah I'm overall not super

488
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:13,390
like crazy about baked goods

489
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:17,790
so no I have not do you think you would

490
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:21,069
use dating apps if you were single well

491
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:23,079
I don't know I mean it's hard to say

492
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:25,809
like I am not in that position so

493
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:29,169
obviously I don't know maybe maybe no I

494
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:32,200
would say like a 50/50 because I am more

495
00:17:29,169 --> 00:17:34,000
like traditional and like conservative I

496
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,790
don't know if I appear that way but like

497
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,679
who I am as a person I am very like kept

498
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:40,299
to myself you may not believe that

499
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:42,370
because I think on YouTube I portray

500
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:44,590
that I'm very like outgoing and I am

501
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:46,150
when I'm comfortable you know like after

502
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:47,500
doing YouTube for so many years I am

503
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:49,000
with speaking in front of the camera and

504
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,860
I'm comfortable with my friends and

505
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,350
people like that but to strangers I am

506
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:55,480
more shy and reserved so I feel like

507
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:57,790
something like a dating app although I

508
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,560
can see I can see why like people use it

509
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:01,540
because during this like day and age

510
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:04,120
especially like with living in LA - I

511
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:06,220
think it's so hard to meet people and if

512
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,930
you work full time like what like what

513
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:09,850
time do you have to go meet people like

514
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:13,060
naturally I think dating apps are a good

515
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:14,860
place to like meet people so I say 5050

516
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:17,920
because I feel like because of who I am

517
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:19,690
I am just more like I guess like

518
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:23,410
traditional where I would want to meet

519
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:24,820
someone in person rather than online but

520
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:27,370
I think if I reached a point where like

521
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:28,660
it's just been drive for a long time and

522
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:31,000
like you know I'm not meeting anybody

523
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:32,470
you know single then I would give dating

524
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,030
app to try like I wouldn't be opposed to

525
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:38,080
it what's your favorite part about being

526
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:40,120
a youtuber there are lots of things that

527
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,560
I love about being a youtuber I think if

528
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,300
the first thing would have to be if

529
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:45,910
you're able to create a career out of

530
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:48,280
being yourself you know like all the

531
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:50,230
other jobs that I listed earlier to you

532
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:52,360
guys is that all of these jobs I'm

533
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:54,940
working for someone or I'm working for

534
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:57,100
something and it's fulfilling that

535
00:18:54,940 --> 00:19:00,610
business or that person's goals it's not

536
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:02,620
my own you know I think being on YouTube

537
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:04,780
has really allowed me to make a brand

538
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:06,820
out of just Who I am and like my beliefs

539
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:08,080
that part about YouTube I think is just

540
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:10,570
absolutely amazing

541
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,040
and especially just looking at where my

542
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:14,860
parents come from my dad was like a

543
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:17,500
villager from Vietnam and he came to

544
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:19,270
America as a refugee and as for my mom

545
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:21,790
she came here as an immigrant as well

546
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:25,030
and my families they have nothing like

547
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:25,870
they literally had nothing I remember my

548
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,880
parents would tell me these stories

549
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:28,960
about like their upbringing and what it

550
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,380
was like when they first came to America

551
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,990
and when I just compared my life and

552
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:36,850
what I get to do in my career compared

553
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:38,860
to like what my parents come from like

554
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:41,590
what what more can I ask for you know

555
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:43,930
I'm so so blessed to have this

556
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:46,390
opportunity like I can't believe this

557
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:47,350
thing that I started doing when I was 15

558
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:50,350
because I was bored

559
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:54,820
became my career like not a day goes by

560
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:57,940
where I talk about this but yeah like

561
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:59,299
not a day goes by where I don't

562
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,860
appreciate this but

563
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:02,210
yeah hope that answer your question and

564
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:04,249
on top of that another thing that's

565
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:07,190
really rewarding about this job is just

566
00:20:04,249 --> 00:20:09,019
knowing that like how do I put this so I

567
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:11,179
remember like one time this person was

568
00:20:09,019 --> 00:20:13,279
saying to me how you know in life you

569
00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:14,690
have to leave behind your legacy you

570
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:16,190
know whether that be your children or

571
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:18,379
like something philanthropic that you

572
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:19,610
did and I was just thinking like oh you

573
00:20:18,379 --> 00:20:21,190
know I don't really care to have a

574
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:23,840
legacy like I just want to live my life

575
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:26,629
but then the person was like well think

576
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,460
about it like once you die if you didn't

577
00:20:26,629 --> 00:20:31,489
leave behind something whether that be

578
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:34,220
another generation or like something to

579
00:20:31,489 --> 00:20:36,919
your name then you like never existed

580
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:38,480
and which is true you know not that I

581
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:40,639
would care honestly like if I'm dead I'm

582
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,080
dead so like it don't matter but then it

583
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:44,269
kind of did get me thinking where I'm

584
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,460
like okay well it's kind of cool to

585
00:20:44,269 --> 00:20:48,590
think that beyond my family and my

586
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:50,809
friends there are so many other people

587
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:52,850
who know of my existence who've got to

588
00:20:50,809 --> 00:20:55,009
be a part of my life or people that I

589
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:56,600
had the opportunity to like impact you

590
00:20:55,009 --> 00:20:58,909
know or they have an impact on their

591
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:01,399
life whatever it is that like I preach

592
00:20:58,909 --> 00:21:03,889
and show it's crazy to think that it can

593
00:21:01,399 --> 00:21:05,659
have a positive impact on someone else's

594
00:21:03,889 --> 00:21:06,980
life and that's really really rewarding

595
00:21:05,659 --> 00:21:08,989
like how many people can go through

596
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:12,200
their life and say that they were able

597
00:21:08,989 --> 00:21:13,489
to touch and impact a lot of people you

598
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,109
know what I mean like I think that

599
00:21:13,489 --> 00:21:17,509
part's really really cool and really

600
00:21:15,109 --> 00:21:19,399
rewarding about YouTube how are you and

601
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:21,649
while keeping your relationship strong

602
00:21:19,399 --> 00:21:24,320
okay can I talk how are you and wha

603
00:21:21,649 --> 00:21:26,330
keeping your relationship strong during

604
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:29,359
quarantine in this relationship with wha

605
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:31,940
oh my god we've been together for going

606
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:33,590
on nine years this September so it's

607
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:35,600
been like eight and a half years now and

608
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:37,309
we have just grown so much

609
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,529
when this quarantine first happened I

610
00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:41,929
was thinking like oh damn I'm getting so

611
00:21:39,529 --> 00:21:43,730
sweaty I'm so hot right now I'm like my

612
00:21:41,929 --> 00:21:45,320
nipple pasty imma nowhere why am I

613
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:47,690
wearing these nipple pasties it's so

614
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:50,960
hard there's no AC in this room as you

615
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:53,149
guys know okay anyways let's continue I

616
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,869
think just being patient with each other

617
00:21:53,149 --> 00:21:58,879
is my answer like if you are struggling

618
00:21:56,869 --> 00:22:00,559
with your relationship during this time

619
00:21:58,879 --> 00:22:03,190
just be patient with each other

620
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:06,169
understand that you both are equally as

621
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:08,450
stressed out of whatever's going on you

622
00:22:06,169 --> 00:22:10,549
know sometimes I think it can feel very

623
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:12,180
one-sided especially if you're feeling

624
00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:13,350
something so stronger like

625
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,940
I'm going through this like you just

626
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:16,380
need to understand but in a time like

627
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:18,660
this we just gotta be there for each

628
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:20,580
other you know both parties are feeling

629
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:22,890
the anxiety and the stress of what's

630
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:25,200
happening in the world so how can you as

631
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:26,760
a couple be strong and be there for each

632
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,060
other and be supportive but also be a

633
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:32,040
listener for each other yeah so patience

634
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:34,530
patience really is something that will

635
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:36,270
take your relationship so far if you

636
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:38,940
just have the patience for each other

637
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:41,250
and I think that's what's kind of helped

638
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,830
wanna I get through our relationship too

639
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:45,270
like we've always been patient with each

640
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:47,160
other even though sometimes we're not

641
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:49,020
patient initially at the moment but

642
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,360
we'll always have that space in our

643
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:52,860
hearts to be patient and be a good

644
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,360
listener for each other and just hear

645
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:56,670
each other out the first thing you want

646
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:58,140
to do after quarantine you guys probably

647
00:22:56,670 --> 00:23:02,070
already guessed it but I want to go

648
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:05,280
camping I am having the itch to go

649
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:07,470
camping I just want to be back in nature

650
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,450
so badly and maybe not even just camping

651
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:11,670
even hiking like I would love to be able

652
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:13,560
to just go hike again I just want to be

653
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:15,450
like out of nature again you know I

654
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:17,100
could be obviously in my backyard but

655
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:18,900
it's different like I want to be on a

656
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:22,530
hike I want to be like in the mountains

657
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:24,900
I want to like smell that air like oh I

658
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:27,090
just love camping it's like one of my

659
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,860
favorite things to do in life camping is

660
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:29,790
just something that brings me so much

661
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:32,370
joy

662
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:34,110
like I've learned so much while being in

663
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:36,330
the outdoors anytime that I'm faced with

664
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:38,190
any problems being outdoors

665
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:41,370
I feel like always helps me find an

666
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:43,590
answer I love the outdoors and I just

667
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:45,900
really cannot wait to be like on the

668
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:47,070
road again that's what I'm really really

669
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,200
looking forward to and that's what I

670
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:51,390
miss the most how do you deal with

671
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,850
negativity from people even when it's a

672
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:55,320
family member so actually this is kind

673
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:57,000
of like something I answered earlier but

674
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:59,280
whenever dealing with negative people

675
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,690
you can't there's just like two options

676
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,820
you know you can either just be negative

677
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:04,230
with them let their negativity affect

678
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:06,900
you or you can be the light in their

679
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:09,180
life and my biggest thing with people

680
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:11,370
that are negative is that you don't have

681
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:13,770
to be them you know like if you're

682
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:15,840
around someone that's super negative you

683
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:18,000
don't have to be them you don't have to

684
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,740
let it affect you it's up to you like

685
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,420
you can't change how an another person

686
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:23,070
feels but you can change how you react

687
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:25,370
to it and how you feel find it in

688
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:26,630
yourself to just have more patience

689
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:28,160
you know and we're like find it in

690
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:29,900
yourself to be like confident and

691
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,720
express how you feel without being

692
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:33,290
negative you know so yeah hope that's

693
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,820
helpful

694
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:37,550
what are pros and cons about living

695
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:40,160
together before marriage there are lots

696
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:41,930
of pros and cons I think I think more

697
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:44,630
perrault's than cons I made a little

698
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:46,970
list so some pros are that you spend a

699
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:48,920
lot of time together you can help share

700
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:50,480
expenses and responsibilities especially

701
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,190
if you guys have kids or if you have

702
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,890
pets like having someone to share that

703
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:56,600
responsibility is very very nice you

704
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:58,370
never really feel lonely you know you

705
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,540
always have someone to sleep next to

706
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:01,820
you'll always have someone to watch

707
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:03,440
movies with have someone to eat with so

708
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:04,640
you don't feel as lonely and then

709
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,040
someone to help you when something

710
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,110
breaks or need repair which is a huge

711
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:11,179
thing in this household things are

712
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:12,800
always breaking or leaking it's really

713
00:25:11,179 --> 00:25:14,090
nice having someone that you can count

714
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,980
on like someone that you can lean on

715
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:17,510
like obviously I take it upon myself to

716
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:19,640
do a lot of the things to in the house

717
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:21,620
but I love that I'm able to like share

718
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:23,600
that with someone for example when the

719
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:25,400
whole house flooded you know the

720
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,200
backyard flooded I was able to share

721
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:30,280
that stress with someone but yeah some

722
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:32,690
cons is that there are no more surprises

723
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:35,210
not that there's no more but it makes it

724
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:36,679
a lot harder and you don't miss the

725
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:38,000
person like you don't have time to miss

726
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:39,980
the person that's one thing I really

727
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,080
miss about just like the honeymoon stage

728
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:43,820
where like I'm really looking forward to

729
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,650
seeing him but now it's like I wake up

730
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:47,840
and there he is so there's like no time

731
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:49,610
for you to really miss each other or

732
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,290
like planned surprises for each other

733
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:53,960
because you're always together so that's

734
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:55,730
one con you don't really have so much

735
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,700
personal space anymore because you

736
00:25:55,730 --> 00:26:00,620
obviously are sharing your space so it's

737
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,940
all about like being more mindful of how

738
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:03,380
you can live with each other but still

739
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:06,530
have your personal space because you

740
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:07,910
still can but it is different than like

741
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:09,320
if you were to live alone if you lived

742
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:11,870
alone you can have everything exactly

743
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:13,490
how you want it you know you can have

744
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:14,840
your space whenever you need you can

745
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:16,640
have quiet time whatever you need but

746
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,140
when you live with someone say I want to

747
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,670
have quiet reading time but was like

748
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:21,800
watching TV like we have to find a

749
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:24,200
balance between that and another con

750
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:26,570
would be living habits this is something

751
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,710
that one I struggled with a lot in the

752
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:31,760
beginning of our relationship we're a

753
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:34,400
lot more into now but early on he was

754
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,690
such a clean freak that I just didn't

755
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,990
know how to match up to that and we

756
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:41,330
fought so much about it because he is so

757
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:42,860
cooller about how he wants things and i

758
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:44,000
just didn't care you know i would be the

759
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:45,679
type where I'm just like throwing my

760
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,170
clothes all over the place I didn't do

761
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:50,750
laundry I would leave dishes in the sink

762
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:52,580
but he's like a clean freak okay like a

763
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:55,100
germaphobe he's a lot better now he's

764
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:57,230
like he's not so crazy anymore but yeah

765
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:59,510
early on our living habits did not match

766
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:01,700
up and that was very stressful for the

767
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:03,890
both of us I hated hearing him nag about

768
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:06,260
how he wanted me to be more responsible

769
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:08,450
and more clean and he hated the fact

770
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:09,950
that he had to always bring it up so and

771
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:11,150
then the last thing that I listed here

772
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:12,650
I'm sure there are more pros and cons

773
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:13,820
but this is just like when I came up

774
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:15,950
with quickly another thing is that

775
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:18,140
you're sharing all of your life

776
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:20,360
basically obviously you have your own

777
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:22,580
things but majority of the things you

778
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:24,140
share so you have to be mindful of these

779
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:26,120
things anyways I hope you guys enjoyed

780
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:28,100
