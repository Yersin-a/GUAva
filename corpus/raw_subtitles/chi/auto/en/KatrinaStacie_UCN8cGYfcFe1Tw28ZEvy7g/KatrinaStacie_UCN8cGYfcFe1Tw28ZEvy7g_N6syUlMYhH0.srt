00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:13,349
hi everyone its Katrina and welcome back

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,900
to my channel so today I have another

4
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:18,000
Q&A video for you all about a year ago I

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,320
did a Q&A video and answer some of your

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,090
questions about like the college

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,430
application process my thoughts about

8
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,050
going to Harvard and all these pre grad

9
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,699
school feels and I thought it'd be cool

10
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,410
to do another Q&A video now that I'm

11
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:31,140
more than halfway through my program and

12
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:33,780
then do a final one after I graduate and

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,520
create a little series to just track how

14
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,590
I feel and what are my thoughts

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,239
throughout this journey so I want to

16
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,829
give a huge huge thank you to everyone

17
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:42,270
who left a question or multiple

18
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:44,219
questions and I'm gonna try my best to

19
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,989
get through a bunch of them and actually

20
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:47,850
outline this video because I didn't want

21
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:49,829
to keep rambling on and on so the first

22
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,750
question is which school are you in so

23
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:54,149
I'm currently in the Harvard Graduate

24
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,280
School of Education teacher education

25
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:57,570
program or Thep and I'm in the history

26
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,309
cohort and I'm currently doing my

27
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:01,469
student teaching and I'm teaching AP US

28
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,879
history question number two how did you

29
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:04,920
decide on what to study and which

30
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,810
program to pick for grad school so I

31
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,430
went in to UC Irvine knowing that I

32
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,840
wanted to go into the education field

33
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,430
and I've always been thinking about

34
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,900
being a teacher when I first got

35
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,939
admitted to UCI there wasn't an

36
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,680
education major available so I chose

37
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:18,630
psychology and social behavior because

38
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,750
that seemed like the closest thing and

39
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:24,509
then once the education major opened up

40
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,189
during my second year I decided to pick

41
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:28,409
up both of them so I graduated with a

42
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:30,420
double major as I was considering grad

43
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:33,060
schools I knew I wanted to continue in

44
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,000
the education field but I started

45
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,740
thinking about counseling maybe a little

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,470
part of me thought about research for

47
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,869
time teaching but I eventually committed

48
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:44,939
to teaching and I knew that I wanted to

49
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:46,710
do a combo program I knew I wanted to

50
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:48,780
get my masters and teaching credential

51
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,030
at the same time so I was only looking

52
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,619
at grad schools that offered the

53
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,720
master's degree and the teaching

54
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:56,340
credential I ended up applying to four

55
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,250
different programs I applied to

56
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,140
Harvard's program UCLA UC Davis's and

57
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,420
Stanford's and I was just about to

58
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,060
submit my application for UC Irvine but

59
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,860
then I got into Davis and I realized

60
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,690
that I wanted to go to Davis more than

61
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,760
UCI so I decided to save myself the

62
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:14,040
application fee and I didn't end up

63
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,959
to UC Irvine for the results just to be

64
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,579
transparent and you all I got into to

65
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:20,579
school so I got into Harvard and I got

66
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:22,379
into UC Davis and on the same day that I

67
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:25,379
got admitted into Harvard I got

68
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:28,470
wait-listed to UCLA so for me like the

69
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:30,060
top two were Harvard in UCLA my family

70
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:32,220
really wanted me to go to UCLA since it

71
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,480
was close to home I really enjoyed the

72
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,579
people that I met and the interview I

73
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,200
had with UC Davis but I ended up going

74
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:40,920
with my number one choice which was

75
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:44,400
Harvard and I eventually got rejected

76
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:47,010
from UCLA like months after I said yes

77
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,620
to Harvard so yeah those were overall my

78
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:51,450
results Stanford net zero chance so the

79
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,129
next question is did you consider a PhD

80
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:55,590
instead of a masters and what factors

81
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:57,959
that you consider slash help you weight

82
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,519
your decision for me it was pretty clear

83
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:01,470
that I wanted to do a master's a

84
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,680
professor once told me that a good sign

85
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:07,530
that you're ready for the PhD path or

86
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,239
that PhD path is the right one for you

87
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,549
is if there is a question that just

88
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:13,799
keeps you up at night that sparks a fire

89
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:16,139
within you that you just really feel the

90
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:18,629
need to dive deeper into and research

91
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:21,389
and for me there wasn't a question that

92
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:23,129
did that for me and honestly when I was

93
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:25,919
involved in research and during my

94
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:27,989
senior year and a little bit post-grad

95
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:29,459
it was kind of dreadful like I don't

96
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:32,280
know every time I would have to bright

97
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:34,470
those papers I just did not really enjoy

98
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,660
it and so I couldn't imagine doing that

99
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:38,669
for four to five years but I'm not

100
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,169
closed off to the idea like I think I

101
00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:42,750
just wanted to get into the classroom

102
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:45,060
first and then if you know after years

103
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,530
if I noticed things or a question pops

104
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:49,019
up then maybe that will be the time to

105
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:51,180
go research more and get a PhD but for

106
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:53,040
now I think that a master's was really

107
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,530
the clear decision for me I'm sending my

108
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,799
AB soon for online grad school and how

109
00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:00,030
was your flow different from undergrad

110
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:01,560
congratulations on almost submitting and

111
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,120
good luck there were some big

112
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,069
differences between undergrad and grad

113
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,690
school for me for undergrad I felt like

114
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:10,079
I was always playing it very safe in

115
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:12,840
that I had a pretty hard like I'm gonna

116
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:14,970
take 12 academic units like three

117
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,280
classes a quarter and then let myself

118
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:19,799
fill up on extracurriculars in undergrad

119
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,109
I flew solo for the most part I did not

120
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:24,060
really consult with like friends or you

121
00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:25,110
know peers to take classes I would just

122
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,400
take whatever I needed

123
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:28,740
I would go to class I didn't really

124
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,710
study with others didn't really like no

125
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:33,659
people in my classes my academics were

126
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:35,069
very important and my extracurriculars

127
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:37,349
were also very important to me so I

128
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:38,879
definitely prioritize both those things

129
00:04:37,349 --> 00:04:40,830
and I felt like I had a pretty

130
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,810
well-rounded schedule for grad school is

131
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:44,729
really different because I really

132
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:47,669
realized that I'm capable of a lot more

133
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:50,759
than I previously thought I was before

134
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:52,919
you know as the child teenager undergrad

135
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:55,050
I just felt like I was constantly

136
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:57,629
limiting myself and saying like okay

137
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:59,340
this is your you know zone of proximal

138
00:04:57,629 --> 00:05:01,349
development this is where you can

139
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,819
succeed if you go any more than that

140
00:05:01,349 --> 00:05:05,099
it's just gonna be too much for you

141
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:06,930
right and you're not gonna succeed and

142
00:05:05,099 --> 00:05:09,360
the reason why you're doing well is

143
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:11,250
because you're kind of finding that

144
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,620
comfort zone and putting yourself in

145
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:15,090
there in grad school I really couldn't

146
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,909
stay in that comfort zone because there

147
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:20,189
was just not enough time and I usually

148
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:22,620
took 12 units right as I said in grad

149
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:25,080
school fall semester I took 24 units it

150
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:28,169
was a completely like new intense

151
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,729
schedule for me but I did it I conquered

152
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:32,639
it I was able to get straight A's and

153
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:34,710
for the first time I relied on other

154
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,539
people a lot of my friends were in my

155
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:38,669
classes we had cohort mates and it was

156
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:40,770
just really nice to see familiar faces

157
00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:42,449
in class and a made class just so much

158
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:45,210
more enjoyable as I'm sitting with my

159
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:47,490
friends and for the first time I had a

160
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:50,009
reading group so we would split up the

161
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:51,750
readings and we would each take turns

162
00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:54,719
taking our notes and that helped

163
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:56,699
commenced me I I loved the Technic

164
00:05:54,719 --> 00:05:58,259
Studies reading group and I felt like I

165
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:59,909
didn't need a sit in front you know

166
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:01,169
before I was like oh I always succeed

167
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:02,969
because I sit in the front

168
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:05,610
I buy my textbooks I take notes on paper

169
00:06:02,969 --> 00:06:07,469
and I had such a different routine in

170
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:09,210
grad school I'm constantly taking notes

171
00:06:07,469 --> 00:06:10,919
on the computer just to save paper and

172
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:12,930
it's more efficient and quick and just

173
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:14,879
to have things in one space I'm not

174
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:16,379
really sitting in the front although I

175
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:18,539
think it would be better for my own

176
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:20,250
focus and engagement sometimes I just

177
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:22,650
don't even think I have the time or

178
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:24,150
energy or capacity to be getting

179
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:27,240
involved in like on campus involvement

180
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:28,830
so I'm here to you know finish the

181
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,139
program take my classes do my student

182
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:33,120
teaching but I'm not as concerned about

183
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:34,949
getting involved which I do regret

184
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,569
because I feel like I only have three

185
00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:39,000
more months of the resources that are

186
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:41,370
available to me and I just don't think I

187
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,110
even made like a little dense thing what

188
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:45,600
is offer here so there's just not enough

189
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:48,480
time and another thing I don't know this

190
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,070
fits within flow but I think that it's

191
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,890
nice because in grad school I see a

192
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:55,560
clear relation between what I'm learning

193
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:58,560
in either my classes or workshops or

194
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,090
student teaching to my future career so

195
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,430
I feel like I'm walking into these

196
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:04,830
spaces looking for things that I can

197
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:06,780
pool and take away with me to use in the

198
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:08,010
future where as an undergrad I felt like

199
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,600
there was just a variety of different

200
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:12,090
things that I was learning and not

201
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,750
everything was directly related to what

202
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:15,090
I would be doing

203
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,680
I think grad school I'm like reframing

204
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:18,870
the way that I'm walking into these

205
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,730
spaces so it's really cool to just see

206
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:22,530
what I can get out of these things next

207
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:24,870
question is how do you manage to keep

208
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:26,120
your coolness at an all time high all

209
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:29,520
the time

210
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:31,470
Thank You Philip you too so the next

211
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,230
question is by Karen and it is can you

212
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:39,000
bring me back a Harvard Shot cup tada

213
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:42,360
oops price tag that uh-oh

214
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,090
good cash did I you're welcome next

215
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,680
question is I'm going to why is s or

216
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:48,240
Yonsei international summer school this

217
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,970
summer and I watch your Yonsei video

218
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,740
thank you how rigorous for the classes

219
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:55,050
during my summer I young say I took two

220
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,790
classes I took developmental psychology

221
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:58,800
which was a major class for me and then

222
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:01,860
contemporary Korean culture which was a

223
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,360
GE and they weren't too rigorous but one

224
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,770
thing I do want to point out is that

225
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,390
they were inconsistent in their

226
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,640
structure and the way they were taught

227
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:10,620
because the two professors were from

228
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,600
very different parts of the world so my

229
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:15,060
psychology professor was from California

230
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:17,130
so her teaching style the way her class

231
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:19,260
was run was very familiar to what I was

232
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:23,160
used to whereas my Korean contemporary

233
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:24,720
culture professor was from Korea but he

234
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,840
is currently a professor at a university

235
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,640
in Singapore so I'm not exactly sure if

236
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,830
the classes are very different but I

237
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,659
felt like the way he ran his class was a

238
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:35,669
little bit different than I was used to

239
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:37,140
so I felt like I had a slightly harder

240
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:39,000
time in that class and I was going to

241
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:41,219
office hours a lot more I would probably

242
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,169
recommend taking two courses instead of

243
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:45,570
three if you still want to you know have

244
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:48,780
some fun while you're there and not be

245
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:50,520
too into studying so even with those two

246
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:52,050
classes I really spent my weekdays

247
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,430
studying and then I

248
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:55,050
myself have fun and go out on the

249
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:57,480
weekends I hope you have a good time at

250
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:58,890
Yonsei have fun so the next question is

251
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,030
how do you know if you're doing

252
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:02,310
something that you're most passionate

253
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:03,660
about I really like this question and it

254
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:05,700
got me thinking because I actually

255
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:09,060
didn't really know how to answer it for

256
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:10,890
me if I get really excited thinking or

257
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,570
talking about something it's usually a

258
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:14,970
good sign that I'm passionate about it

259
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,590
and if it consumes my mind as I'm doing

260
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:18,540
random things like you know getting

261
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:20,670
ready to sleep or showering or walking

262
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:22,140
to school and just these ideas pop up

263
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:24,300
and I get really excited about it

264
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,920
that's how I know that this is something

265
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:28,440
that I'm passionate about for example

266
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,330
sometimes as I'm showering I'll think of

267
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,010
like lesson plan ideas for school and

268
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:34,110
and I get really excited and I had to

269
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:35,880
tell Ryan right away um when I'm

270
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:37,530
planning my family parties and the games

271
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:40,050
like those are the things that I would

272
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:41,550
stay up late thinking about a doing u2

273
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:43,590
idea sometimes I would just be like

274
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:45,270
walking and I think about a an idea and

275
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:47,250
I get really excited or I think about a

276
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:49,440
brand that I want to ask to collaborate

277
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:51,150
with and I get really excited I feel

278
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,160
like because I don't like staying up

279
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:54,780
late if I'm staying up late to do

280
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,370
something that is not like due or an

281
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,290
assignment that's usually a good sign

282
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:59,970
that I'm passionate about it because I

283
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:01,770
don't like staying up late to do things

284
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:03,000
so yeah and maybe you'll be different

285
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:05,100
for other people but that's just how I

286
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,960
kind of think about things that I'm

287
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,640
passionate about so the next question is

288
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,340
what was the scariest part about moving

289
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,840
so far away I feel like for me many of

290
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:15,690
the things that would have been scary

291
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:17,340
like being alone here moving to a new

292
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,780
place not knowing anyone being in a

293
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:21,510
possibly rocky long-distance

294
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:24,210
relationship all of that we're not scary

295
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:26,490
because Ryan came with me so huge huge

296
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:28,350
huge thank you to Ryan I always tell him

297
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:30,240
that's what I was an ugly heart huge

298
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:32,370
thank you to Ryan for coming with me I

299
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,990
really feel like because he came with me

300
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:36,330
so many of the things that would have

301
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:39,120
been scary and concerning for me and my

302
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:40,940
family were alleviated so now when I

303
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,470
think about the scariest thing is

304
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:45,720
probably being far away from my family

305
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:48,600
and not being able to immediately be

306
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,980
there if something happens and to just

307
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,570
not always be in the loop of what's

308
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,430
going on because the only way I'll know

309
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:56,010
what's going on is if someone decides

310
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:58,140
texts or call me so I don't find out as

311
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:59,910
fast as I would if I were there and I

312
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,350
just feel like because of that I get

313
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,880
worried what if something happens like

314
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:05,100
it's gonna take us a while to get there

315
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,690
and it's gonna cost money and

316
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,400
stuff like that so I think that's

317
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:11,040
probably been the most concerning thing

318
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,810
for me next question is how is the class

319
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,730
culture like at Harvard and did you

320
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:16,800
experience any culture shock so I have a

321
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:19,620
lot of notes for this question I feel

322
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,880
like at the education school people that

323
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,530
I've met I'm really nice and they're

324
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,390
very open to helping and engaging with

325
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:26,430
one another and I've noticed and

326
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:28,140
appreciated how much people are willing

327
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:30,780
to share in class and how much we learn

328
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:32,550
from each other even in classes where it

329
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:34,350
doesn't seem like you might have a

330
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:37,200
connection with you know the topic or

331
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:39,150
the material I've really appreciated how

332
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,010
much I've been able to connect my own

333
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:42,450
experiences in my own story with what

334
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:44,250
we're learning about and it that really

335
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:46,860
just enriches like the learning

336
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:49,470
experience and makes it so much more

337
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:51,630
powerful I feel like we derive most of

338
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:53,760
our learning from each other and the

339
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:55,020
text rather than our professor just

340
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,210
telling us what's going on because

341
00:11:55,020 --> 00:12:00,060
rarely did I have professors just

342
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:01,860
lecturing I only had one class where it

343
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,300
was like an undergrad course so there

344
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,470
was like a mix of undergrad and grad

345
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,360
school students and it wasn't in the

346
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:07,800
education school where the professor

347
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,960
would be lecturing the whole time and

348
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,910
that brought me back to undergrad vibes

349
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,770
but in the grad school like we're

350
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:16,140
constantly getting up doing activities

351
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:18,360
group discussions breakout groups to the

352
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,500
point where I remember like in one of

353
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,180
our classes we would have to get up

354
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,690
multiple times during those three hour

355
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,210
classes

356
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:25,680
and we were really tired from like being

357
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,720
at our school sites the whole day so we

358
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,640
were just like please stop making us get

359
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,320
up like just lecture for three hours you

360
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,700
just in our classes we're definitely

361
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,530
forced to discuss more and to

362
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,090
participate and share our ideas and it

363
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:39,630
made me feel really anxious because I

364
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:42,930
felt like my ideas were so I don't know

365
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:44,700
like basic compared to my peers and I

366
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:47,460
felt like I didn't really have so much

367
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,900
to add to our conversations so that was

368
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:50,940
definitely a source of anxiety but it

369
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,680
was really nice to see like some of my

370
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:54,150
friends and peers felt the same way and

371
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,010
that we were able to be vulnerable and

372
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:57,990
open to admitting that yeah like this is

373
00:12:56,010 --> 00:13:00,120
how we feel although you think that like

374
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:01,500
some people would be like hey like what

375
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,600
you said I was really grand you know

376
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,740
like it feels so good when you're saying

377
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,390
something and people like snapped

378
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,920
because in grad school like people snap

379
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:11,280
a lot when they agree with what you say

380
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:13,560
and let me tell you the validation the

381
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:16,110
good feeling that comes when you hear

382
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,449
like you say something and then is in

383
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:20,250
the back crap

384
00:13:17,449 --> 00:13:21,630
so thank you to everyone who has told me

385
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:23,279
that they appreciate something that I've

386
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:25,139
said in class or that they've snapped

387
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,120
for me because it really takes like a

388
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:29,310
lot for me to be able to share and I

389
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,399
just really appreciate like the external

390
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:34,560
validation oh as for culture shock I

391
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,050
definitely experienced a positive

392
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,449
culture shock with just the different

393
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:41,579
demographics of students peers that I

394
00:13:39,449 --> 00:13:44,160
have here with me for those of you don't

395
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:47,670
know I come from a part of LA that is

396
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,500
very how to say like monolithic it's

397
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:50,730
like an ethnic Enclave where everybody

398
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,709
kind of comes from the same background

399
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:55,199
right most of the people that I grew up

400
00:13:52,709 --> 00:13:57,000
with our families where Chinese or

401
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:59,550
Vietnamese and our parents were from

402
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,100
Vietnam and they escaped the Vietnam War

403
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:04,110
they came as refugees and that's kind of

404
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,779
like the narrative that every family all

405
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:09,000
my friends have so for me like that was

406
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:11,880
what I was used to and coming here like

407
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,529
I'm working with students and peers from

408
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,209
so many different parts of the world and

409
00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:17,910
from the different parts of the US as

410
00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:19,800
well so my students like I have so many

411
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:23,790
students from the West Indies Cape Verde

412
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:26,790
Jamaica Ethiopia Eritrea Somalia Algeria

413
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:28,620
Morocco Bangladesh just so many

414
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:30,839
different places and when I first saw

415
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:32,370
the roster of our students there were so

416
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:35,279
many names and I just never heard of

417
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:37,470
before and that just really was kind of

418
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,810
like culture shock to me because like I

419
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:42,000
was just used to the names like Brandon

420
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:44,370
Kevin Ryan Brian

421
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,290
those kind of things back home so seeing

422
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:48,930
these different names was really amazing

423
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:50,550
to me and even in my cohort where often

424
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:52,649
the United States but were from such

425
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:54,269
different parts of the United States so

426
00:14:52,649 --> 00:14:55,980
it's really cool to see what was

427
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:57,389
different in our experiences growing up

428
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:59,069
what was the same in our schooling

429
00:14:57,389 --> 00:15:01,050
experience isn't just to learn from each

430
00:14:59,069 --> 00:15:03,269
other there I think of all the things

431
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:04,709
that I've gained I feel like that is the

432
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:07,829
number one thing that I'm grateful for

433
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:09,690
for being able to go to Harvard and live

434
00:15:07,829 --> 00:15:11,760
in Cambridge is to work with such a

435
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:12,990
diverse group of people I don't I don't

436
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,600
know if I would have another opportunity

437
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:17,430
to live outside of that specific part of

438
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,810
LA that I'm from and so I just feel

439
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:21,600
really grateful to have this opportunity

440
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:24,149
to be able to live here and experience

441
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,100
such a different part of America so I

442
00:15:24,149 --> 00:15:28,920
guess kind of related to that a huge

443
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:30,150
fear that I've had going into teaching

444
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,280
coming to

445
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:34,080
however was how am I gonna connect to

446
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,370
students or friends if I don't know

447
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:38,370
anything about where they're coming from

448
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:40,170
and I mean this was definitely a flaw in

449
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:43,440
my own mentality that I was so fixated

450
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:45,060
on potential differences right like well

451
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,220
I don't know so much about this

452
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:50,610
ethnicity or this part of the world or

453
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:52,920
this language and I felt like that would

454
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:55,050
be a huge disadvantage for me working

455
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,220
with a group of students who I wasn't

456
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:58,710
familiar with their culture and

457
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,840
background but I realized that there are

458
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:02,430
so many more similarities and the

459
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,260
differences are a great opportunity to

460
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:06,660
learn from each other because whereas I

461
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:08,040
thought that oh everybody knows my

462
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,270
narrative because I come from a place

463
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,520
where everyone has such a similar

464
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:13,170
background story it was the common you

465
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,640
know the common narrative for me but

466
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:16,590
coming to this place and sharing my

467
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:19,020
story I'm so shocked to see how

468
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:21,180
surprised people are and my family had

469
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:23,670
this kind of journey and for so many of

470
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:25,350
them they had no idea about like the

471
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:27,510
boat people and stuff like that so it's

472
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:29,730
been a really great opportunity to share

473
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:31,950
my story my family's story and to learn

474
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:33,870
about others family stories as well this

475
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:35,580
question hi if you also feel very

476
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:37,410
disappointed when you study for this

477
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:39,120
test but then you get a very bad score

478
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:41,010
and you lose all motivation in your body

479
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,590
and end up soaking if you have

480
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:44,850
experienced this how do you cope up so

481
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:48,450
when I read this I immediately thought

482
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:50,010
to two instances one was right after my

483
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:52,380
stats midterm in my senior year of

484
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:54,450
college and another was right after my

485
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:57,210
health psychology midterm also in my

486
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:59,460
senior year of college I just felt so so

487
00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:01,860
so discouraged and disappointed because

488
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:03,630
I did feel like I studied so hard and I

489
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:06,240
felt like I was confident and then I

490
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:08,820
came out of there feeling so shitty to

491
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,560
the point where I was crying right so I

492
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:13,290
think my advice would be to one sit in

493
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:16,020
those negative sad disappointed emotions

494
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:17,310
and to cry if you need to cry to do

495
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:20,550
whatever you need to do to let those

496
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:23,280
feelings out to is to you know maybe

497
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:24,630
still soak but as you're sulking reflect

498
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,209
on what you could have done differently

499
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:29,280
maybe and come up with an action plan to

500
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:30,930
bounce back so I just think like it's

501
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,520
normal to feel so upset when you've

502
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:34,170
studied so hard and you felt confident

503
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:36,450
walking in and the result is just

504
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:39,270
completely opposite but just try not to

505
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:41,370
beat yourself up over and to be sad but

506
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:42,790
also find a way to cheer yourself up

507
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:44,380
that day that day

508
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:46,060
to that health psychology midterm I

509
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,440
actually came home and filmed a video

510
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:50,260
because I knew that that would make me

511
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:53,110
feel better so out of that day came my

512
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:54,280
study tips video so you know that

513
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:55,750
there's something that would make you

514
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:58,450
feel better whether it's turning our

515
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:59,920
music eating something I would treat

516
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:02,020
yourself to that right because you did

517
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,880
work hard and then after that come up

518
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,650
with an action plan of what you can do

519
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,930
better next time so the next question is

520
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:10,240
how do you feel about going back home so

521
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:12,040
I definitely feel mixed feelings about

522
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,630
going back home I feel like on the one

523
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,430
hand I'm really excited to be back with

524
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:18,220
my family my friends to be able to see

525
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:20,290
them more often on the other hand I feel

526
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:22,450
like I fear that I'm gonna be this like

527
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:24,430
post grad slump but like I was after

528
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:26,650
undergrad where I'm just gonna feel so

529
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:28,300
unproductive and unmotivated and lazy

530
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:30,460
there's something just about home that

531
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:33,370
makes me feel that type of way sometimes

532
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:36,280
so I feel like I'm excited to you know

533
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:38,200
start my real career get a job and do

534
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,460
all that and then at the same time I

535
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,320
know that I'm going to miss being a

536
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:43,780
student here despite how stressful it is

537
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:46,750
sometimes just the independence just the

538
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:47,920
routine living with Ryan looking forward

539
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,750
and not looking forward to it I don't

540
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:51,250
know a lot of feelings so the last

541
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:54,730
question is who is your favorite

542
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:56,650
Australian cousin that's a toughy I'm

543
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:57,600
gonna have to go with definitely not

544
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:59,860
Darren's

545
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:03,190
just kidding you're all right you're all

546
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:04,840
right mate so that wraps up this Q&A

547
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:06,670
