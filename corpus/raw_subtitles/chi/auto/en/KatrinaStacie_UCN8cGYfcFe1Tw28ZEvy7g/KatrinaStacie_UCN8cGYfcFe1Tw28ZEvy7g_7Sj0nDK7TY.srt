1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,840
happy Asian Pacific American Heritage

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:11,940
Month hi everyone its Katrina and thank

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,830
you so much for cooking so the month of

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,049
May is Asian Pacific American Heritage

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,670
Month and for this month I really wanted

6
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:19,680
to make a video talking a little bit

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,510
more about my culture and my experience

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,160
growing up as an asian-american you

9
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,080
might be familiar with the phrase a

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,000
picture's worth a thousand words and so

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,130
that's kind of my idea for this video I

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,790
wanted to share short anecdotes through

13
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:34,980
photos so let's go first photo is a

14
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,420
picture of me and my mentee Martin and I

15
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,010
want to talk a little bit about my

16
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,070
Chinese name and what I'm wearing here

17
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:44,070
so my Chinese name is yet shower in

18
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:48,750
Mandarin and I believe the name could be

19
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:51,570
translated to skillful child and in Chiu

20
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:54,629
Chow it's pronounced yep Chi Yi in

21
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:57,960
Hokkien it's yep Kali and in Cantonese

22
00:00:54,629 --> 00:01:00,660
its EEP Howie so nobody really calls me

23
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,250
that because everybody my family just

24
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,250
calls me now or Nana which is a

25
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,170
shortened version of Katrina but yeah

26
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,180
that is that's my Chinese name and then

27
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,250
too I'm wearing a cheap how here which

28
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,979
is the traditional like Chinese dress

29
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,240
for women and this was my first time

30
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:15,780
wearing a cheap how it's actually my

31
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,299
roommate's

32
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,860
but I was M seen for a Lunar New Year

33
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,049
event and she let me borrow it and I

34
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,970
just felt so so beautiful in it and I

35
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:25,740
remember just thinking to myself that I

36
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,049
really wanted to wear one for my wedding

37
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,450
so that is still on the agenda I hope I

38
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:30,869
can find a really nice one yeah thank

39
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,240
you Darcy

40
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:35,610
so the second photo here is a photo of

41
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,130
me and my preschool class that is me in

42
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,450
the front center and I use this photo to

43
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,880
talk a little bit about the community

44
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,470
that surrounded me growing up I'm so

45
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,350
I've said this in multiple videos before

46
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,880
but from the get-go the community that I

47
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,649
went to school with the community that I

48
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,479
lived around were filled with a lot of

49
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:52,560
people who look like me so even though I

50
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,320
was a minority

51
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,180
I didn't often feel like one growing up

52
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,219
because there were so many people around

53
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,619
me that had similar backgrounds similar

54
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:05,130
family histories spoke similar languages

55
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:08,550
at home ate the same food and so I never

56
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:10,410
felt like I was really embarrassed of my

57
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,940
culture because so many people around me

58
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,100
also had

59
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:15,620
in culture and I think because of that I

60
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:18,020
was able to develop a very strong sense

61
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,910
of cultural pride and belonging and

62
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:21,710
self-worth and this wasn't something I

63
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:23,930
realized until I got much older I

64
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:26,510
actually took a class this past fall and

65
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:28,460
we learned about colonial education and

66
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:30,500
the effect that it has on minority

67
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:33,200
students in America and across the world

68
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:35,510
and I did a whole paper on the benefits

69
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,630
of ethnic enclaves for minority students

70
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:41,300
especially in America and how having

71
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:43,330
these ethnic enclaves not only helped

72
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,290
foster the sense of belonging and

73
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,330
confidence and self-worth in these

74
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:49,880
students but it also has benefits

75
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:52,430
towards their academic performance right

76
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:54,230
social performance and how they view

77
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:56,420
themselves in comparison to their peers

78
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:58,550
it made me think a lot about my own

79
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:00,470
experience growing up but also as an

80
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:02,420
educator how can I make sure that these

81
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:04,880
spaces are created in the schools so

82
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:08,090
that all students feel the sense of

83
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:09,560
belonging so this next picture here is a

84
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:12,380
picture of me coming home from Chinese

85
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,970
school and this is the award that I got

86
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,500
and a couple of trophies that my sister

87
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:17,480

88
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,989

00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:03,999
it

170
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,709
a lot of people who bring you know

171
00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:07,389
ethnic foods to school sometimes they

172
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:09,490
have this traumatizing experience where

173
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:10,749
everybody makes fun of them and I did

174
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:12,369
have an experience like that but it

175
00:07:10,749 --> 00:07:14,529
wasn't as traumatising because I was a

176
00:07:12,369 --> 00:07:17,949
lot older so in high school I remember

177
00:07:14,529 --> 00:07:20,139
that I would bring food and one dish

178
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:22,389
that I brought was Dubai Tokyo which is

179
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:24,579
this ground pork and ginger and I loved

180
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:26,919
it is super good and I brought it with

181
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:28,569
rice and I didn't get to eat it in time

182
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:31,659
during lunch so I have to bring it to my

183
00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:33,759
fifth period class and I remember it was

184
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:35,860
like open a jar I didn't start eating

185
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,329
yet but my teacher who by the way like

186
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,529
I'm not mad at him or anything I'm his

187
00:07:37,329 --> 00:07:40,029
friend like we're friends on social

188
00:07:38,529 --> 00:07:42,369
media he's a really cool and nice guy

189
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:46,539
but I think what he did was a little

190
00:07:42,369 --> 00:07:50,069
insensitive so that day he was like oh

191
00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:53,009
my god hoorah fish into my classroom

192
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:56,469
smells so bad and then he looked at me

193
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:58,149
it was you wasn't it what is that do not

194
00:07:56,469 --> 00:08:00,519
bring that into my classroom ever again

195
00:07:58,149 --> 00:08:02,259
and I was a little bit mortified just

196
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:05,019
sitting in the front like oh my gosh

197
00:08:02,259 --> 00:08:06,339
okay I didn't take it like oh my gosh

198
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:07,719
I'm so embarrassed of what I'm eating

199
00:08:06,339 --> 00:08:09,490
and I'm never gonna bring this to school

200
00:08:07,719 --> 00:08:13,240
again more so just like I'm not gonna

201
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:15,129
bring this into his classroom again this

202
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,689
stuff is good and it smells good it's

203
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:18,490
not even fish to begin with do you

204
00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:21,459
understand that I think certain smells

205
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:23,619
can be a little bit off-putting or

206
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:25,839
foreign to people but I don't think and

207
00:08:23,619 --> 00:08:27,879
I would not suggest you call out

208
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:31,389
anybody's food like that like I think

209
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:32,889
young people um is so distasteful yeah I

210
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:34,779
wouldn't do it so the next photos are

211
00:08:32,889 --> 00:08:37,509
pictures of me and my sister and this is

212
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:39,849
when I was about like nine ten eleven

213
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:41,529
and this is really when my hair started

214
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:43,839
to kind of get crinkle

215
00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:46,839
and frizzy and wavy towards the front

216
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,490
parts of my hair and growing up when I

217
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:50,499
was very young my hair was very straight

218
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:52,029
and all of a sudden as I got a little

219
00:08:50,499 --> 00:08:54,819
bit older my hair started getting very

220
00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:57,370
frizzy and it was a really difficult

221
00:08:54,819 --> 00:09:00,519
transition for me because all my friends

222
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:03,189
my sister my family they had straight

223
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:06,519
hair very silky straight like that Asian

224
00:09:03,189 --> 00:09:09,160
hair that I just really wanted and I

225
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:10,269
remember just it was so hard to like

226
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,709
look at myself in the mirror everyday

227
00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:13,149
and just have this like fringe ball I

228
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:15,129
couldn't have a cute thing that

229
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:17,139
everybody had because the shorter that

230
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:18,730
my hair went like the crazier it would

231
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:20,620
get when I got my hands on a

232
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:22,360
straightener like that was my baby and I

233
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:24,639
wouldn't never go to school without

234
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,439
training my hair it is still something

235
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:28,300
that like if I were to do one thing to

236
00:09:26,439 --> 00:09:30,999
make myself feel better and look better

237
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:33,220
in my own eyes like I straighten my hair

238
00:09:30,999 --> 00:09:34,629
so these next photos are gonna be of my

239
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:38,529
family and I just want to talk a little

240
00:09:34,629 --> 00:09:40,329
bit about the struggle that I've had and

241
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:44,499
still have when trying to balance

242
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:47,259
between the filial piety of Asian

243
00:09:44,499 --> 00:09:49,660
culture and the individualism of

244
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:51,459
American culture I'm constantly like

245
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:55,209
faced with trying to balance these two

246
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:56,829
and this has definitely rang true when

247
00:09:55,209 --> 00:09:59,559
I'm making these bigger decisions like

248
00:09:56,829 --> 00:10:01,480
where to go to school I'm for certain

249
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:04,149
and that a huge huge huge reason why I

250
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:06,490
chose UCI over UC Davis was because it

251
00:10:04,149 --> 00:10:08,800
was closer to my family and that's why

252
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:10,329
making that decision to even move across

253
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,699
the country to come to Harvard was such

254
00:10:10,329 --> 00:10:15,220
a difficult decision and even in terms

255
00:10:12,699 --> 00:10:17,439
of like who I'm dating I think whether

256
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:19,240
or not like my family approves or gets

257
00:10:17,439 --> 00:10:21,189
along with them is such a huge factor

258
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,740
and it's not always been like the

259
00:10:21,189 --> 00:10:25,689
easiest but I do think that that is

260
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:27,100
something huge that I consider and I

261
00:10:25,689 --> 00:10:28,959
think along the lines of that something

262
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:31,959
that you know me my cousin's my sister

263
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:33,519
and also the older generation are trying

264
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:35,920
to navigate is this balance between

265
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,170
being more open-minded to the other

266
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,929
generation and not just kind of butting

267
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:42,519
heads time after time and trying to be

268
00:10:40,929 --> 00:10:44,649
more understanding about where we're

269
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:46,120
coming from as this generation and where

270
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:47,499
they're coming from knowing that

271
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,889
everybody in our family is very

272
00:10:47,499 --> 00:10:53,160
sensitive but just trying to be open and

273
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:55,000
understanding I think is is this ongoing

274
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,529
struggle and journey

275
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,240
I'm happy to say that I think there's

276
00:10:56,529 --> 00:10:59,829
been a lot of improvement but I think

277
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,720
there's always gonna be more learning

278
00:10:59,829 --> 00:11:04,180
that we all can do so these next photos

279
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,490
I want to put are going to be me my

280
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:08,319
sister in our very kpop fangirl phase in

281
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:09,879
high school and I just want to talk

282
00:11:08,319 --> 00:11:11,949
about comments that I've got throughout

283
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:13,810
the year saying oh you look Korean wow

284
00:11:11,949 --> 00:11:16,029
you look just like Korean girl just like

285
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:18,009
a Japanese girl and my relatives or

286
00:11:16,029 --> 00:11:20,470
friends or acquaintances they're always

287
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:21,879
saying this as a compliment and it

288
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:24,220
wasn't until I got older that I realized

289
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:26,860
how problematic it was that people are

290
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:29,019
saying oh you look Korean or Japanese as

291
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:31,300
a compliment rather than saying hey you

292
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:33,220
look good a lot of times when my

293
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,839
relatives say it before I was just kind

294
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:37,449
of like thumbs up give you a little

295
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:39,160
sticker but more so I think I'm trying

296
00:11:37,449 --> 00:11:40,870
to say like no I look like a Chinese

297
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,250
girl I look like a Chinese Merrit girl

298
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:44,500
but I want to look like a Chinese

299
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,699
American girl for these next photos I

300
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,740
want to share a little bit about my

301
00:11:45,699 --> 00:11:50,889
experience as an asian-american stepping

302
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:53,259
outside of my bubble of my hometown and

303
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:55,629
of me in college as an undergrad and me

304
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:57,670
in grad school here in Massachusetts so

305
00:11:55,629 --> 00:11:59,470
in undergrad I worked a lot with

306
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:01,870
international students and they

307
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:03,879
primarily came from China and so I

308
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:06,730
started to identify myself and others

309
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:09,220
would identify me as an ABC or an

310
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:10,839
American born Chinese or a domestic

311
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,819
student that would come out a lot

312
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:14,110
because I would be in a lot of mentoring

313
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:16,149
program where we would mentor

314
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:18,430
international students and I felt like

315
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:20,259
it was a great position and advantage

316
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:23,139
point for me because I was able to

317
00:12:20,259 --> 00:12:24,339
navigate and kind of switch coat switch

318
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:26,920
a little bit and understand those

319
00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:29,439
cultures the Chinese culture and also

320
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:31,750
the American culture so I felt I felt

321
00:12:29,439 --> 00:12:34,029
really good about my identity there so

322
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,350
now coming to Harvard Massachusetts it's

323
00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:38,829
really the first time where I'm

324
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:40,269
experiencing not being a part of the

325
00:12:38,829 --> 00:12:42,699
majority in terms of what I look like

326
00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:45,610
and for the first time I'm in classes

327
00:12:42,699 --> 00:12:49,149
where it's very visible that I am one of

328
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:52,149
only few Asians and I have struggled a

329
00:12:49,149 --> 00:12:54,339
lot with where my voice fits in in what

330
00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:56,829
often seems like this racial binary and

331
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:59,290
this is something I touched upon on my

332
00:12:56,829 --> 00:13:00,910
presentation video as well and I was

333
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:02,740
talking about this with my friend the

334
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:05,380
other day who is also Asian American

335
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,819
that sometimes in these spaces like for

336
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,140
the first time where we're talking about

337
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:10,120
Asian Americans

338
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:12,520
in educational space we have conflicting

339
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,080
feelings because on the one hand it's

340
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,910
great to like whoa we're finally talking

341
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:18,010
about the group I belong to it but at

342
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:19,900
the same time whenever asian-americans

343
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:21,910
are brought up it's not in a good light

344
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:24,670
right it's talking about the model

345
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:27,370
minority myth or stereotypes or the

346
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:29,770
Chinese Exclusion Act or covin 19 and

347
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:31,840
all the discrimination and so it's just

348
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:34,270
this kind of like conflicting feeling

349
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,560
we're like yay we're finally being

350
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:38,110
talked about and then like oh god

351
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,550
everything is really shitty so there's

352
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:42,070
there's those kind of feelings that

353
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:43,750
arise so the last picture I have is this

354
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:46,180
picture of me and Ryan going to see the

355
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:47,680
farewell and fall and I want to use this

356
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:49,900
to talk a little bit about Asian

357
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,310
representation in media but recently my

358
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:54,010
friend and I were talking about this

359
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:55,960
increase in Asian representation in the

360
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:57,340
media and how exciting it was to see

361
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,950
things like never have I ever

362
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:02,560
James conveniens fresh-off-the-boat

363
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:03,940
crazy rich Asians and how problematic it

364
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,730
is that people are looking to these

365
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:08,770
shows to represent the entire group that

366
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:10,390
they're depicting I think an example of

367
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:12,370
this is when people were getting mad at

368
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:15,010
crazy rich Asians because it was not

369
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:17,050
depicting Chinese people in what they

370
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:19,420
saw as accurate right they were saying

371
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:22,870
not everybody is rich like this this is

372
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:25,540
just a very small set but that movie was

373
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:27,880
never looking to represent all Chinese

374
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:29,830
people but I think it's because there's

375
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,840
not a lot of Chinese people in the media

376
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:34,960
we look to these couple of movies that

377
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:37,810
we can get to see oh is this gonna tell

378
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:40,270
my story correctly like we look to see a

379
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:42,670
reflection of ourselves and in some ways

380
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:45,700
it is and it's great but in many ways

381
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:48,700
when we feel like oh they got it wrong

382
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:50,980
it becomes this like tension because we

383
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:53,530
get so concerned about how people are

384
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:56,110
gonna perceive our group whereas we

385
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:58,330
never look at friends the TV show or

386
00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:01,330
like nothing's really coming to my mind

387
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:03,370
except head amant at our Will & Grace or

388
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:05,320
Everybody Loves Raymond I'm even though

389
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:07,270
I didn't really watch those shows no one

390
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:09,010
really looking to them and say but

391
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:11,170
that's not really how my family and my

392
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:13,360
friend group is because there's so many

393
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:15,790
white families and friends depicted on

394
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,800
television but there's not a lot of

395
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:20,220
Indian Americans so people are gonna

396
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:22,710
look to never have ever to see well how

397
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,300
of a job they do did they exaggerate

398
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:26,100
these stereotypes a little bit too much

399
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,630
but in the end like I'm really excited

400
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,700
to see these shows but I think that it's

401
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:32,160
something that needs to be talked about

402
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:34,410
that these shows are not trying to be

403
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,730
representative of every single Asian

404
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:37,590
American family out there

405
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:39,570
so that's all for this video I hope you

406
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:41,580
all found it either to be enjoyable

407
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:43,560
