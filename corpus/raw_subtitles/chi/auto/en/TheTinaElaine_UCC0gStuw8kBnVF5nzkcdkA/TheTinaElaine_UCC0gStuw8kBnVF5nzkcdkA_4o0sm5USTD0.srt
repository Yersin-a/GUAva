57
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,399
let's briefly talk about my school so my

58
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,399
elementary school had about 400 people

59
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,920
predominantly white but are you really

60
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,320
surprised and there was

61
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,360
little to no diversity and when i mean

62
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,119
little to none

63
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,320
i mean like none i was the only asian

64
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,600
person at school

65
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:11,599
the only chinese person at school and

66
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:14,000
one of two pocs in our entire

67
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,640
school it didn't help that i grew up in

68
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,360
a small

69
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,599
town in the suburbs so people here were

70
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,080
very close-minded very racist to begin

71
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,720
with

72
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,440
plus they had no exposure to people of

73
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,000
color

74
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,920
growing up asian-american meant that

75
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,319
people would constantly pull their eyes

76
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,360
back

77
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,360
to greet me and sing chinese japanese

78
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,640
people would constantly mock my eyes and

79
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,680
say

80
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,000
are your eyes even open like they're so

81
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,720
small people would make fun of my facial

82
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,879
features

83
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,560
say that they're too flat to say that i

84
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,040
look like a pancake

85
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,680
people would say that my skin is weird

86
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,319
because it's

87
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,120
yellow people would make fun of my

88
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,599
culture

89
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,319
and my language by mocking me and saying

90
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,080
i know chinese too

91
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,239
it meant that i was my school's

92
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,319
laughingstock when it came to lunch time

93
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,200
because my mom would always pack me cold

94
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,200
lunch

95
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,239
and it would always be traditional food

96
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,239
from home

97
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,760
and people would always say i bet you

98
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,840
eat cats and dogs and that's why it

99
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,920
smells so bad and looks so weird it's

100
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,640
kids telling you to go back to your own

101
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,400
country

102
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,080
go back to where you came from why don't

103
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,799
you just go back to china

104
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,640
when you were born in the u.s like i

105
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,840
hate to break it to you tom

106
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,760
but i was born in chicago so sit down

107
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,239
it's working hard in school and then

108
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,319
having people discredit your hard work

109
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,159
because you get good grades and tell you

110
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,519
things like of course you get good

111
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,599
grades like you're asian

112
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,879
asians are naturally smart it's in your

113
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,760
genetics

114
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,000
like please if it is in my genetics then

115
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,480
why

116
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,920
is it that i suck that math it's

117
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,000
constantly being treated

118
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,360
as a perpetual foreigner when people

119
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,599
hear you speak

120
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,480
and say things like wow your english is

121
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,000
so good

122
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,519
when did you come to the u.s where did

123
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,680
you learn english

124
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,040
you sound just like a native english

125
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,720
speaker these are just

126
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,840
a few simple examples of everyday life

127
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,840
that we experience

128
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,439
as an asian american like there's so

129
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,519
much more that i could say about it but

130
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,000
this was just a very brief

131
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,519
breakdown overview of what it's like so

132
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,440
let's start off with kindergarten

133
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,079
basically in kindergarten i had a

134
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,079
teacher

135
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,919
who liked to do this thing called star

136
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,639
of the week and star of the week was

137
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,120
essentially

138
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,960
show and tell so each week our teacher

139
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,759
would have one student present

140
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,040
a item an animal a toy basically

141
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,840
anything that they want to share with

142
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,680
the class

143
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,440
and this is a fun way to get students to

144
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,120
learn how to present build speaking

145
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,919
skills and build

146
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,560
confidence well i was a very energetic

147
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:45,759
happy

148
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,600
bubbly outgoing kid and i would raise my

149
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,120
hand each week very politely

150
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,040
hope that my teacher would call on me

151
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,600
and she would not so it's been a few

152
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,840
months

153
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,440
and nothing happens so i come home from

154
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,520
school one day really depressed and i

155
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,199
just tell my mom like hey

156
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,039
kids at school have been able to present

157
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,120
for start of the week for like two or

158
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:06,000
three times already and i have yet to go

159
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,080
once and my mom was like why didn't you

160
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,639
tell me sooner

161
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,639
i'm sitting there obviously just really

162
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,240
innocent and naive of what is happening

163
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,600
and i just told her like oh i never

164
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,120
thought about it i thought i just

165
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,479
had to wait my turn because every time i

166
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,440
asked my teacher she was just like it's

167
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,400
not your turn yet

168
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,000
my mom was so furious and my mom is just

169
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,560
a strong independent asian

170
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,080
woman she will go and call you out if

171
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,000
you are racist towards her

172
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,919
so she dragged me back to school this

173
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,680
was like 4 p.m when i came home from

174
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,160
school she dragged me back to school

175
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,840
into the principal's office and she told

176
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,120
the principal what happened then my mom

177
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,199
got to talk to my teacher

178
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,199
and basically nothing really happened

179
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,280
that day she spoke her thoughts i was

180
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,960
really thankful that my mom spoke fluent

181
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,880
english and she was able to speak up for

182
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,800
me she basically told her this is not

183
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,560
okay you should not be discriminating my

184
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,919
daughter just because she is asian just

185
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,479
because she is chinese and she's

186
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,520
different

187
00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:01,199
so more months go by and nothing happens

188
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:04,000
until it is the last week of school

189
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,800
it is the last week of june and i

190
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,600
finally

191
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,880
get called on and it is my turn to be

192
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,639
star of the week

193
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,000
something that i've always wondered is

194
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,600
whether or not my teacher would have

195
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,080
given me a chance

196
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,520
had i not told my mom and had she not

197
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,840
complained to the school

198
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,919
but honestly letting me present that one

199
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,440
time was also just kind of like a slap

200
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,560
in the face because it's basically her

201
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,639
just telling me like

202
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,639
hey i gave you what you want you asked

203
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,759
for it i gave you a chance to present

204
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,160
and that's it that's all you're gonna

205
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,400
get

206
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,319
my school life was not the best because

207
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,639
people always bullied and discriminated

208
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,520
me

209
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,120
for being asian and so i was always left

210
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,199
out and i didn't really have a lot of

211
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,639
people who played with me during recess

212
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,479
so there was this one day in

213
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,199
kindergarten where it was

214
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:49,280
pouring rain okay i just remember

215
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,599
vividly it was pouring rain and i was

216
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,360
just

217
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,599
sitting on the blacktop by myself

218
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,599
because i had no one to play with

219
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,360
and there was this group of girls that

220
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,680
was playing red light green light

221
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,840
and they invited me to join them and i

222
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,560
was just genuinely so excited i was like

223
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,400
oh my gosh

224
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,000
like maybe this is the day that i make

225
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,479
some new friends

226
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,520
and so i go play with them everything is

227
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:14,080
great

228
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,080
until this one girl stepped on my

229
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:20,160
shoelace

230
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:23,280
middle school okay so this teacher miss

231
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,280
k did not like me you know some teachers

232
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,599
their first impression of you no matter

233
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,280
what you do they just do not like you

234
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,720
she was one of those teachers she

235
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,720
absolutely hated me

236
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,960
and she made it clear that she did not

237
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,880
like me one day during passing time i'm

238
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,880
trying to rush and grab my textbooks for

239
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,240
my next class i'm at my locker just

240
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,080
trying to grab my textbooks

241
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,759
shoving them into my backpack i just had

242
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,560
no time it's like five minutes you guys

243
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,080
know how it is

244
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,919
and people are running behind me in the

245
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,479
hallways right trying to get to class

246
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,759
and my teacher is a mile away down the

247
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,800
hallway okay

248
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,240
she sees me she blows her whistle at me

249
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,039
she had a little whistle that was like

250
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,680
on a necklace

251
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,680
she blew her whistle and she was like

252
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,919
young lady you better stop now

253
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,639
and change out of that outfit or i'm

254
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,800
sending you to the principal's office

255
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,720
keep in mind my mom was the one who came

256
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,479
up with my outfits for school

257
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,160
even when i was in middle school so this

258
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,520
was mom approved because she was the one

259
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,440
who picked my outfit okay

260
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,599
my family is very conservative when it

261
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,400
comes to how much skin exposure i have

262
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,560
and in general

263
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,520
i have like a very modest style too like

264
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,199
i don't really show

265
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:29,759
anything you know so this was completely

266
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,879
appropriate for school but my teacher

267
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,919
had to call me out

268
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:36,880
you guys i was wearing a yellow

269
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,959
long sleeved hollister top it had

270
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,719
hollister on the side of the sleeves

271
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,719
the neckline was just like this one

272
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,240
right here very high i made sure that it

273
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,640
was not see-through by wearing

274
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,720
a white tank top underneath and then i

275
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,640
wore gray leggings on the bottom

276
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,880
my teacher told me that my outfit was

277
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,519
way too inappropriate because of my gray

278
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,760
leggings

279
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,080
which were distracting for the boys in

280
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,080
class i talked to my friends and we just

281
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,680
all didn't understand but we all came to

282
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,480
the conclusion that she was just

283
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,720
concerned

284
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,800
about either camel toe or my butt

285
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,440
showing i made sure when i went to

286
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,920
school

287
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,760
that everything was covered i was so

288
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,399
skinny in middle school like there was

289
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,279
no butt

290
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,440
okay i had no butt that existed and yes

291
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,720
she was so pressed about my outfit that

292
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,440
i had to go

293
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,640
and change into my gym clothes otherwise

294
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,399
i would have been called to the

295
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,120
principal's office so this was high

296
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,680
school

297
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,040
and my geometry teacher had us do

298
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,880
homework the night before

299
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,560
and so i do my homework and then i come

300
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,480
to class and i find out that i

301
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,240
have been picked to be the volunteer to

302
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,560
write down like my answers

303
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,760
on the board and so i do it and i sit

304
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,000
down

305
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,920
we go through the answers and come to

306
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,320
find out that i actually got the answers

307
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,720
correct and turns out i spelt the word

308
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,680
theorem wrong but like i got the actual

309
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,760
answer correct

310
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,600
so we should have just moved on but my

311
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,560
teacher proceeded for the next 10

312
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,959
minutes

313
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,680
to laugh about how i could not spell

314
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,440
that word

315
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,839
and he was just being so dramatic like

316
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,880
he was like repeat after me

317
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:08,320
t h

318
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:10,320
e o r

319
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,399
like he literally was having me spell

320
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,480
out every single word so i'm in

321
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,480
university i'm an english major and i

322
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,760
also certified in teaching english as a

323
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,600
second language

324
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,000
and there was not a lot of asian people

325
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,440
who were in this department and any pocs

326
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,040
that we had in class were mostly

327
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,040
international students we're sitting in

328
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,839
linguistics class and our teacher asks

329
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,519
only the international chinese students

330
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,360
to talk about what problems they faced

331
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,640
while learning english or any words that

332
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,240
they struggled pronouncing

333
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,640
so obviously i'm just sitting there

334
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,160
quiet because i'm not an international

335
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,720
chinese student so i'm just sitting

336
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,640
there

337
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,880
and listening my teacher thought she was

338
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,519
real smart and she goes and picks on me

339
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,200
tina you've been quiet all class let's

340
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,279
hear about your experiences

341
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,480
in china so i'm sitting there unsure

342
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:55,040
what i should say

343
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,800
and so i open my mouth and i'm like miss

344
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:00,640
with all due respect

345
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:03,120
and she cuts me off and says oh my gosh

346
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,480
you sound just like a native english

347
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,360
speaker where did you learn

348
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,800
english like your english is so good and

349
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,279
i tell her

350
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,279
i was born in chicago miss and she

351
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,120
replied with well how was i supposed to

352
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,200
know it's not like you spoke up and told

353
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,320
me first of all she blamed me for not

354
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,920
speaking up

355
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,600
when obviously i wouldn't speak up

356
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,560
because she was asking for only the

357
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,279
international

358
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,240
students second of all she just assumed

359
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,480
by my face

360
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,480
because i was asian that i was an

361
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,240
international student and i had learned

362
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,640
english and that my english was so

363
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,800
good and then she got upset at me the

364
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,600
following week we had a final exam in

365
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,760
her class

366
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,640
and she docked off four points from my

367
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,160
exam

368
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,079
otherwise i would have gotten a perfect

369
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,640
score she knocked off four points

370
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,560
and the question wasn't even a yes or no

371
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,560
answer so technically nothing should be

372
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,720
a wrong answer and therefore i shouldn't

373
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,279
have lost those points like she asked

374
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,240
an opinionated question she said in your

375
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,320
opinion

376
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,079
what do you think of this and this and

377
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,480
it was a long answer question

378
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:04,639
so i answered it very thoroughly and she

379
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,040
gave me zero points for that question

380
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,320
and i lost four points and so i go to

381
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,160
her office hours

382
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,839
and i ask her why i got the question

383
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,959
wrong and she told me

384
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,760
because your opinion is wrong apparently

385
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,959
you can have

386
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,800
a wrong opinion my mom and i have always

387
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,720
loved going to tj maxx because of the

388
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,880
variety of things that are there

389
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,079
and we love buying suitcases and purses

390
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,480
and things like that

391
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,880
and every single time we check out and

392
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,839
we buy a suitcase or a purse or a

393
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,560
backpack

394
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,480
they always look at us as if we're

395
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,720
stealing things from the store

396
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,720
like they are checking every single

397
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,040
pocket every single crack they're just

398
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,040
like

399
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,720
flipping everything inside out to make

400
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,800
sure that we're not stealing anything

401
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,000
my mom has confronted them multiple

402
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,399
times before

403
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,279
asking them are you discriminating me

404
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,959
right now

405
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,360
why is it that you have to check all the

406
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:57,920
pockets and they always tell her

407
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,880
ma'am it's just a store policy but the

408
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,279
interesting thing

409
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,000
is there's always white people in front

410
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,360
of us

411
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
who buy purses and bags and just get to

412
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,000
check out and

413
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
leave without having them check the

414
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,399
pockets or anything like that they don't

415
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,200
check

416
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,720
anything and they just leave so how are

417
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,000
you going to tell me that this is store

418
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,279
policy or store

419
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,040
protocol but not do it for all

420
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,880
this other time i was shopping alone at

421
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,320
the mall and i called my mom to see if

422
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,560
she needed anything

423
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,600
and she told me yes so she was listing

424
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,920
off different things

425
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,079
and then i was reciting them back to her

426
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,079
all in chinese mandarin because even

427
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,839
though my mom speaks english it's just

428
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,680
easier and faster for her to speak in

429
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,360
mandarin and so i respond to her in

430
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,240
mandarin because i'm on the phone with

431
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,839
her

432
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:46,399
and this white woman stops me

433
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,639
while i'm in my conversation with my mom

434
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:52,160
and she tells me

435
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:55,600
this is america

436
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:58,880
we speak english here

437
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,079
and i'm like ma'am i'm on the phone with

438
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,440
my mom

439
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:06,320
do you mind and she was like i do

440
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,600
mind if you're going to talk to her then

441
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,680
speak in english

442
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,279
what does me talking to my mom have to

443
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,360
do with you

444
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,120
like i do speak in english but do i

445
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,839
really have to speak in english with my

446
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,320
mom

447
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,360
on the phone when i'm asking if she

448
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,279
needs anything

449
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,120
this woman really just went out of her

450
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,880
way to tell me that i needed to speak

451
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,639
english because this was america

452
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,040
this story is not mine but it's from my

453
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,199
cousin and this was roughly about 15

454
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,160
years ago he was walking around college

455
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,279
campus

456
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,760
and all of a sudden he got jumped after

457
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,519
he got

458
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,839
jumped they beated him until he passed

459
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,839
out

460
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,519
and proceeded to steal all of his money

461
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,880
and belongings that he had

462
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,440
in his backpack this pandemic i used to

463
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,680
think

464
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,600
that everything ended with verbal

465
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,560
harassment or verbal bullying

466
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,360
verbal abuse but now i see that people

467
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,320
have become

468
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,199
so violent and their hatred is so deep

469
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,600
to the point

470
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,560
that they are murdering our people that

471
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,360
they are killing

472
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,959
and burning and stabbing our people all

473
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,480
because of what all because of the

474
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:12,160
chinese virus

475
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:15,680
the china virus the kung flu

476
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:18,320
it is way too late to go back now

477
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,519
but saying these things were never okay

478
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,320
to begin with

479
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,519
and asians and asian americans were

480
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,480
warning

481
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,839
people that this was going to end up

482
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,240
very badly

483
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,959
if you just generalize a whole group of

484
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,920
people

485
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,920
as a virus

486
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:45,360
it is not a chinese virus or an

487
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,800
asian virus and it is sick that people

488
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,320
have made it that way

489
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:53,600
and now i fear to go out of my house

490
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:56,240
i fear to allow my parents to go outside

491
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,240
of this house

492
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,600
when i was little my parents owned a

493
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,519
restaurant and there had been plenty of

494
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,079
encounters that i've had with racist

495
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,759
people

496
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,519
when people would come and grab their

497
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,480
take out there were many people who were

498
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,320
very rude

499
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,800
and they would just chuck their money at

500
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:16,079
us throw their coins like that

501
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:18,240
and it just felt like we were treated as

502
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,519
dogs it felt like we were being treated

503
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,440
as less than

504
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,040
and the reason why i say dogs is because

505
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,519
in like the chinese culture

506
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,680
being treated like a dog is kind of just

507
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,959
a form of expression to say that we are

508
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,480
being treated

509
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:34,560
very poorly speaking of dogs every year

510
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,000
when it's around the holiday season we

511
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,480
get really busy at the

512
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,519
restaurant and so that year it was on

513
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,920
christmas eve

514
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,040
the bar was packed with people waiting

515
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,000
for their orders

516
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,199
and this woman comes in this white woman

517
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,399
comes in

518
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:53,759
and chucks her food onto the bar table

519
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:56,240
spills her takeout onto the table

520
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,240
and demands me to give her a refund

521
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:02,160
instantly i noticed one thing

522
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:04,880
and that is the bag and the containers

523
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,919
were not even from our restaurant and

524
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,480
the dish

525
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,319
was not from our restaurant so this

526
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,280
person had bought takeout from some

527
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,679
other place

528
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,679
and came to our restaurant and expected

529
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,520
me to give her a refund

530
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:21,360
for something that we didn't even sell

531
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:24,480
to her she yells on the top of her lungs

532
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:27,679
i want a refund because you

533
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:30,480
fed me dog food i fed this to my dog

534
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,080
and even my dog threw up the last

535
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,200
scenario that i'm gonna talk about

536
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:37,919
just sets a fire in my soul

537
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,400
and perhaps it's because ironically it

538
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,360
does

539
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,640
involve a fire one day my dad came home

540
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,960
and i gave him a hug

541
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,000
and he smelled like smoke and i asked

542
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,000
him like daddy

543
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,440
what happened why do you smell like that

544
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,160
like you smell burnt

545
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,280
and he tells me very quietly under his

546
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,679
breath

547
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,480
that there had been a fire at the

548
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,240
restaurant

549
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,080
the person who set the restaurant on

550
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,559
fire was not

551
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,679
happy that a chinese restaurant was

552
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,919
doing better

553
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,840
than the white restaurants in a

554
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,559
predominantly white city

555
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,720
and i come to find out that this isn't

556
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,960
even the first time that it happened

557
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,160
our restaurant had been set on fire

558
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,720
twice

559
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,840
by two separate people just because we

560
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,240
were doing well

561
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,440
what did we do to deserve that my mom

562
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,720
and dad

563
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,799
worked 364 days a year

564
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,799
with no breaks in between and they

565
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,559
worked all day long at the restaurant

566
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,720
so that they could make a living for me

567
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,760
and for our family and someone was so

568
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,280
upset

569
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,200
that my parents were just trying to make

570
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,160
a living that they would do that to our

571
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,559
family restaurant

572
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,240
it didn't really ruin the infrastructure

573
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:47,039
of the actual building itself

574
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,039
but it is just upsetting and it is scary

575
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,760
to see that people will want to set you

576
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,160
on fire

577
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,039
while we were having customers and

578
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,559
employees

579
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,400
inside of the building it's not like

580
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,480
someone set the building on fire during

581
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,640
after hours and no one was there

582
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,480
let's talk about k-pop so as you can

583
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,160
tell from the background i am a k-pop

584
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,240
stance specifically a pts

585
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,679
army and i have a tick-tock account that

586
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,400
has over 82

587
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,799
000 people that seems like a huge number

588
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,120
right

589
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,840
because it is i've had multiple of my

590
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,200
videos

591
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:19,039
go viral over a million views so tell me

592
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,720
why when weeks ago i started to talk

593
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,840
about my experiences growing up as an

594
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,000
asian american

595
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,679
and how hurtful and harmful these recent

596
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,200
actions have been towards me

597
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,799
and towards the traumas that i have

598
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,440
faced in my past and me

599
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,400
asking people to speak up and if you

600
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,039
can't speak up

601
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,480
then please share links and share infos

602
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,320
and share my videos

603
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,320
about what is happening to the asian

604
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,039
community tell me why when i

605
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,840
asked people to just do the bare minimum

606
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,640
to just

607
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,000
care to just give me some of their time

608
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,400
that my videos

609
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
ended up getting like 50 views but in

610
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,559
comparison to 82

611
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,640
000 people in comparison to the fact

612
00:19:54,559 --> 00:20:00,559
that i know i can have viral videos

613
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,000
that people couldn't make one of those

614
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:05,679
videos where i'm talking about

615
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
serious things viral i'm not complaining

616
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,039
about

617
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,880
views i'm not asking you to make me go

618
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:13,360
viral this is not about me

619
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,159
it's about a whole community that i am

620
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,880
involved in

621
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,960
that i take part in that involves you

622
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,080
the people who support k-pop because

623
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,240
your idols

624
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,080
are asian and you're within the asian

625
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,720
community you are in taking

626
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:29,039
asian culture this is not about me

627
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:32,159
complaining about give me viral videos

628
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:34,799
this is not about me but views and

629
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,159
shares and comments is what is going to

630
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,400
boost the algorithm

631
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,400
so more people see it more people hear

632
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,360
about it and more people hear people

633
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,919
like me

634
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,840
tell you that people need to speak up

635
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,640
that more people need to talk about this

636
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,159
issue

637
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,159
and that we can make a difference if we

638
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,880
all just said something or shared

639
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,799
something

640
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,320
it's upsetting to know that media

641
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,640
doesn't really do anything

642
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,440
it's upsetting to me because then i

643
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,919
question

644
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,480
how much people love asians in asian

645
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,200
culture

646
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,679
when you are watching k-pop when you are

647
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,320
watching anime when you are eating asian

648
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:10,720
food chinese food whatever it is

649
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,240
you are consuming asian culture what's

650
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,559
upsetting is that you guys

651
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,000
only choose the parts of our culture

652
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:18,159
that you enjoy

653
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,480
you only choose to accept parts of the

654
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,480
culture that is palatable to you

655
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,720
you only choose parts of the culture

656
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,640
that is trendy or aesthetic

657
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,760
we are not your aesthetic we are not

658
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,080
your trend

659
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,600
when you say you like asian culture or

660
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,000
korean culture because you

661
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,919
like k-pop then do something for the

662
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,120
asian community if you don't want to be

663
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,039
a part of the struggle

664
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,640
the actual issues that we are

665
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,240
experiencing if you don't want to care

666
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,880
about people like me

667
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,640
who are not your idols fine but think

668
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,200
about your idols

669
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,280
who are asian-american themselves i hope

670
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,960
that when you think about it that way

671
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,520
that it can encourage you to speak up

672
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,240
about this issue because i'm honestly so

673
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,600
hurt and disappointed by this community

674
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,760
what we're getting is just

675
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,600
crickets i'm not saying that every

676
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,000
single person has not spoken up about

677
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,880
this

678
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,520
but just by looking at my mutuals list i

679
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,200
see

680
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:14,240
giant creators in the k-pop community

681
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:17,919
who are directly affected and

682
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:20,400
involved with asian and asian americans

683
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,559
and just people of color this is a fight

684
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,000
for pocs too this is not just about

685
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,320
asian americans only

686
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,080
and i do not see these creators doing

687
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,640
their part in doing their share

688
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,480
when you have a platform use it it

689
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,280
doesn't matter how big or small of a

690
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,520
following

691
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,320
but when you have a bigger following it

692
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,159
does reach

693
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,080
more people potentially but then you

694
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,919
also might be in my situation where i

695
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,280
thought that i had a big following and

696
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,120
it would reach a lot of people

697
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,400
but people just don't care enough and so

698
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,600
those videos flop

699
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:52,640
armies are so powerful we can make

700
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,640
a huge difference for this movement and

701
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,000
on top of it all i get messages from

702
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,480
people asking me

703
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,520
why haven't i posted as much content as

704
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,240
i usually do

705
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,559
if i'm being honest i don't want to post

706
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,320
about bts at all during this time

707
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,240
because it makes me upset and it reminds

708
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,440
me of how people are not talking about

709
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,559
the situation

710
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:14,240
and i know kpop is just a genre okay i

711
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,280
shouldn't take things too personally but

712
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,679
i'm sorry

713
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,720
because this directly involves the asian

714
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,120
community

715
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,000
it's really not as far-fetched as you

716
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,919
think it is

717
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,240
i made a video on my new tik tok account

718
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:30,559
today that had only six

719
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:33,600
followers and i reached far more people

720
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,400
than it did on my other account which

721
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,720
had 80

722
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,640
000 followers the number of your

723
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,440
following doesn't matter if you truly

724
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,400
care about this

725
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,000
issue then please speak up if you don't

726
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,480
want to speak about it that's fine too

727
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,720
share my videos please share them share

728
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,440
them on your socials

729
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,400
share links share resources share

730
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,720
petitions

731
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,720
share my link tree please just do

732
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,960
something and don't stay silent

733
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,520
because silence hurts more than anything

734
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,400
else alright so we talked about a lot of

735
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,320
things today

736
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,200
and i know that i kind of got pretty

737
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,080
heated and excited about a lot of things

738
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,080
because

739
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,600
these type of topics are never easy to

740
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,080
talk about and it does get me

741
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,200
kind of upset i hope you guys found this

742
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,600
video helpful

743
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,279
or insightful or comforting i just hope

744
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,520
that this video benefited you

745
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:23,840
in some type of way i'm really curious

746
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,720
about your stories and your experiences

747
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,679
growing up as an

748
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,400
asian or asian american and what acts of

749
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,240
racism

750
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,400
you might have faced or any struggles

751
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,320
