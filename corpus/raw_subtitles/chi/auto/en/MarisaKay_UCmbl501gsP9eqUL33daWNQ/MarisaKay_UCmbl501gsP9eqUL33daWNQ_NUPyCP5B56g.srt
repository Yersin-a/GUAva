1
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:09,360
okay here we go

2
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:12,090
hey guys and welcome to my college Q&A

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,980
video in this video I am basically going

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:16,619
to be answering every question that I

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,810
had as a freshman and throughout college

6
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:21,260
to figure out how I can make the most of

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:24,210
my time at college specifically

8
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:26,730
academically so that I could get a job

9
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,400
after I graduate so now that I have

10
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:32,009
officially been a college graduate as of

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,950
one-week commencement was supposed to be

12
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:38,430
one week ago today and I'm now living in

13
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,960
Portland with my first full-time job but

14
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,540
getting a jumpstart on my career I

15
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,789
thought that it was time to do this Q&A

16
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,770
so I asked all of you guys on Instagram

17
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:47,850
to send me all of your questions about

18
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,210
college

19
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:53,730
resumes networking interview tips and

20
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:56,370
just how to get a job because that is

21
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:58,320
usually everyone's number one goal after

22
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,390
college so you guys sent me so many

23
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,879
amazing questions I actually am going to

24
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,129
be splitting them up into two different

25
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:08,400
videos so this video is specifically

26
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:11,220
talking about my college experience and

27
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,799
what I did in college and then like in

28
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,450
the last term coming up to graduation to

29
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,369
get a job and then in the next video

30
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:21,330
we'll be going more in depth about

31
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:24,180
actual like job application processes

32
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,860
interview tips in-depth networking

33
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,229
advice but I'm going to be talking more

34
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,570
generally about all of those things - in

35
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:32,610
this video so because this video might

36
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,409
get a little lengthy and you all might

37
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,390
be here for different types of college

38
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:38,579
advice I did include all of the time

39
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,710
stamps in the description box down below

40
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:42,810
to every question that I'm answering so

41
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,490
feel free and open that up jump around

42
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,770
to the different questions that you want

43
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,240
to hear answers to and hopefully that

44
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,280
makes it a little bit easier for you to

45
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,140
watch so with all of that being said I

46
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,210
do just want to introduce myself if any

47
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,549
of you are new here so that you know

48
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:59,100
where I'm coming from in this video and

49
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:01,229
my college experience so I just

50
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,500
graduated from Oregon State University

51
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:06,869
with an honors Bachelors of Science in

52
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:09,840
merchandising management a lot of words

53
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:11,730
and I got my first full-time job three

54
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,610
months before I graduated from college

55
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,620
as so

56
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:17,260
show media and marketing manager for a

57
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:19,060
local fitness apparel company now social

58
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:21,100
media and marketing manager doesn't

59
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:23,590
exactly fall under the umbrella of

60
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:25,330
merchandising management majors however

61
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:27,310
that was exactly what I wanted to go

62
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:29,200
into and you guys will see as you watch

63
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:31,360
this video that I kind of had my own

64
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,580
pivot during college and ended up going

65
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,050
the social media route anyways now that

66
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:37,270
you guys know a little bit about me I

67
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:39,640
would love if you followed along on my

68
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:42,250
Instagram at its Marissa underscore Kay

69
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,810
I post a bunch of everyday elevated

70
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:46,330
style inspiration on there

71
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:48,190
just little bits of my life as well so

72
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:50,350
with that I hope you guys enjoyed this

73
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:52,450
video and let's just get into the

74
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:54,790
questions I also just wanted to say

75
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:56,320
before we jump into this video you guys

76
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:59,590
can probably tell from my major but I

77
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:01,330
did major in business and fashion so my

78
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:03,880
college experience is coming from that

79
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:05,320
background and I went into marketing so

80
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,300
if that's an industry that you're

81
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,430
interested in a lot of this advice will

82
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,660
be super applicable and I will be

83
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,910
answering a question at the end

84
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,959
specifically about marketing and social

85
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,850
media marketing

86
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:17,410
I just wanted to preface my video with

87
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:19,480
that before I get into the questions

88
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:22,330
because I'm sure that the college

89
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,610
experience and career path of a business

90
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:27,220
student is very different than someone

91
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:29,680
going to school for like nursing to be a

92
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:31,570
doctor an engineer whatever it is but I

93
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,209
will try and keep my advice as

94
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:35,739
applicable in general as possible no

95
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:38,140
matter what you're thinking of going to

96
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:40,299
college for okay so I did write out all

97
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,440
the questions in a Google Doc and

98
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:43,180
they're sitting on my laptop right

99
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,610
behind this camera to make sure that I

100
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:48,220
stay on track with everything so if you

101
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:49,780
see me looking over there that's why and

102
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,060
question number one that I'm going to be

103
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:54,100
answering is how do you choose your

104
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:56,680
major when you don't know what you want

105
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:58,390
to be yet and I'll just breakfast this

106
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,400
by saying this is a question that I

107
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:02,590
think goes through almost every single

108
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,170
student's mind whether you're in high

109
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:07,209
school or in college or you're even

110
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:09,070
graduating in your life I got this major

111
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:11,320
and I still don't know what the heck I'm

112
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:13,810
going to be doing with it so you are not

113
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:15,610
alone in your decision and in your

114
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:18,010
struggles it's something that we all go

115
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:19,959
through so I think at the core if you're

116
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:21,789
struggling to figure out what you want

117
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,750
to major in you should think about two

118
00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:25,480
different things

119
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:27,700
what you enjoy doing and what you're

120
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,860
good at because I do think like to put

121
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,540
it the most simply everyone's goal is to

122
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,490
major in something and have that kind of

123
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:35,830
be a segue into what they're going to do

124
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:37,480
after college and obviously you want

125
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:39,280
your career to be something that you're

126
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,780
interested in that you enjoy and that

127
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,790
you're good at I think that's not like

128
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,170
the base where you want to start and

129
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:46,300
trying to figure out what you want your

130
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:48,490
major to be and then as far as like

131
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,960
actionable things that you can do to

132
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:53,950
figure out what you're going to major in

133
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:55,750
I started by taking elective classes in

134
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:57,640
high school and then also throughout

135
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:59,740
college to figure out what I wanted to

136
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:02,650
do so my high school offered a variety

137
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:04,330
of elective classes if you were

138
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:07,060
interested in like computer science you

139
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:09,910
wanted to be an EMT childhood

140
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:12,700
development business law so I think

141
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:14,590
taking an introductory class to a

142
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,419
certain type of like industry or career

143
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:18,400
is a really good place to start while

144
00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:20,410
you're in school and college offers all

145
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,300
sorts of classes like that - like

146
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:23,760
introduction to global health or

147
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,020
introduction to business management

148
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,280
something like that also if you don't

149
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,919
want to make a total commitment to

150
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,540
taking a full class to figure out what

151
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,270
you want to major in you can always join

152
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:36,250
student clubs or extracurriculars to

153
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:38,320
help you explore certain job paths or

154
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:40,450
industry as well something else I did

155
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,640
because I'm such a planner and I like to

156
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:44,200
get as much information as possible when

157
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:47,169
I was trying to figure out what I wanted

158
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:49,000
to major in I actually just read through

159
00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:51,610
all of the different undergraduate

160
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,160
degrees and majors on University

161
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:56,440
websites and on those pages usually the

162
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,330
university will give like a complete

163
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,190
list of what types of classes you're

164
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:03,310
going to be taking to get that degree

165
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:05,200
and what types of jobs are expected for

166
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:07,419
someone who graduates with that major

167
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,100
okay and then one more actionable thing

168
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:11,470
you can do to figure out what you want

169
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:13,630
to major in is job shadowing and

170
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:15,850
informational interviews if there is

171
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:17,950
anyone in your network or anyone you can

172
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:19,720
reach out to who is currently working in

173
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:21,970
a position or industry that you're

174
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,250
interested in being able to even have a

175
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:26,620
30-minute phone conversation with them

176
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:28,360
or go and meet up with them for coffee

177
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,520
or lunch and just pick their brain a

178
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,520
little bit about what they do in their

179
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,919
job why they like it kind of

180
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:37,319
realities of the workplace I think that

181
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:39,840
is a great place to start and actually

182
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:42,120
here like firsthand from someone in the

183
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,949
workforce what it's like to be working

184
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,240
in that job and if they've been in the

185
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:47,099
industry for a while I don't think

186
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,830
probably also have some academic advice

187
00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:52,409
for you too for the best academic path

188
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:55,050
that you can take to get that job so I

189
00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:57,449
know choosing your major is like what

190
00:06:55,050 --> 00:07:00,810
keeps a lot of students up at night

191
00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:03,150
having this like quarter life crisis of

192
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:04,710
what the heck am I going to major how am

193
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:06,150
I supposed to choose what I want to do

194
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:08,130
for the rest of my life when I'm 20

195
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:09,930
years old like I have student debt I

196
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:11,819
don't even have a full-time job and like

197
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,979
it's it's just a lot and it can be

198
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:15,449
really overwhelming so what I wanted to

199
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:17,099
make sure I included it's kind of the

200
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:18,810
perspective that I picked up throughout

201
00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:21,900
college and I've taken with me into my

202
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:24,449
career that really helped ease my mind

203
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:27,630
in figuring out what I wanted to do in

204
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:30,150
college so to me I see college and my

205
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:32,280
major is just a start and a launchpad

206
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:34,590
into my career I would look at your

207
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,539
major as an opportunity to learn as much

208
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:38,250
as you can about a topic and explore

209
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:39,930
something that you're interested in and

210
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,880
look at it as something to kickstart

211
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:43,500
your career that does not mean that what

212
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,840
you're going to major in is like the

213
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,099
end-all be-all fate of your career and

214
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,110
what you're going to be doing for the

215
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:50,789
rest of your life I promise you there

216
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:53,009
are so many opportunities throughout

217
00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:54,990
college to pivot your major or once you

218
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:57,150
get into the workforce as you get

219
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:59,940
experience to jump to a new industry or

220
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:02,279
position in your major really is just

221
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:03,990
the foundation and the start there are

222
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:05,340
so many industry professionals that I

223
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:08,219
met and networked went throughout

224
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:10,889
college who said yeah I'm working in

225
00:08:08,219 --> 00:08:12,900
this I majored in this and I just had to

226
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:15,029
find the path between the two to connect

227
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,650
it but realistically they have nothing

228
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:19,590
to do with each other and they still

229
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:21,509
have flourishing successful careers so

230
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:23,340
with that being said I'm going to tell

231
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:24,930
you guys my biggest College advice at

232
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,789
the start of this video I'm not gonna

233
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:28,319
make you wait till the end so I'm just

234
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:30,810
going to tell you guys right now that

235
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,669
your major isn't everything with the

236
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:34,770
exception of maybe like being a doctor

237
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:37,260
or a lawyer where like you need a

238
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:38,520
certain degree to have that job I can't

239
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:41,039
speak a lot to that though because I

240
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,729
majored in business but but anyways I

241
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,769
think what makes you the best

242
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:47,769
candidate is just focusing on your

243
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:49,839
overall college experience not just your

244
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:52,029
major but everything that you're doing

245
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,720
in those four or five or however many

246
00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:54,760
years

247
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,040
to get as much as you can out of your

248
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,560
college experience I think it's a time

249
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,630
to really learn as much as you can about

250
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,310
yourself from your major from the

251
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:05,079
different jobs that you have along the

252
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:06,970
way it's a great time to learn about

253
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:08,680
your strengths and your weaknesses and

254
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:10,510
your experience and when you kind of

255
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,730
come to like the end of the college Road

256
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:15,399
and you're looking for a job employers

257
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:17,470
want to see who you are as a person and

258
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:20,019
what you did with those four years of

259
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:21,639
college they want to see who you are not

260
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:23,529
just what you majored in and that's why

261
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:25,720
I think it's so important to look at

262
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:27,310
your overall college experience and how

263
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,160
you can make the most out of those four

264
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:31,899
years even beyond your major obviously

265
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,940
try and have your major be something

266
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:36,040
that's useful and applicable to help

267
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:38,079
jump-start your career but you also need

268
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:40,630
to be working on other experiences

269
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:42,730
outside of your degree to be the best

270
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:45,490
possible job candidate you can be so

271
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:47,529
longest winded question done right off

272
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:50,500
the bat question number two that I got

273
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:51,819
is how do you find your passions and I

274
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,760
kind of split it up into two different

275
00:09:51,819 --> 00:09:56,769
things I think finding your passion like

276
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:59,860
finding your major everyone has their

277
00:09:56,769 --> 00:10:01,810
own path to doing that as far as finding

278
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:04,110
my own passions I kind of did it in two

279
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:06,490
different ways one was just

280
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:08,800
self-reflection taking the time to

281
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:11,500
really look inwards at what I enjoy

282
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:14,260
doing what brings me joy and

283
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:16,209
gratification and like what kind of work

284
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:17,829
do I like doing that doesn't feel like

285
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:18,970
work at all because I just love it so

286
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:20,649
much

287
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:22,449
the second way to find your passion and

288
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:24,819
this can even be applied to figuring out

289
00:10:22,449 --> 00:10:27,639
what you want to do job and career-wise

290
00:10:24,819 --> 00:10:29,470
is just to learn by doing I think it's

291
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:32,139
so easy to just want to get everything

292
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:33,730
right on the first try and so you kind

293
00:10:32,139 --> 00:10:35,769
of just like stand at the edge of the

294
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:37,839
cliff trying to figure out like am I

295
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:39,339
ready for this am I qualified is this

296
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,500
the right thing for me and you're

297
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:43,839
spending so much time preparing that you

298
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,910
never actually do the thing that you're

299
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,889
set out to do so I think just learning

300
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:50,740
by doing and taking that leap of faith

301
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:52,329
into a passion or a job that you're

302
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,400
interested in it's the best way to

303
00:10:52,329 --> 00:10:56,040
figure out if it's

304
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,840
wrong for you because even if it doesn't

305
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,250
turn out to be right you just figured

306
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,900
out okay this is something that I

307
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,820
actually don't want to do let's pivot

308
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:05,010
and try something else instead of

309
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:07,110
spending so much time just contemplating

310
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:09,000
and trying to figure it out and getting

311
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:10,080
it right on the first try and that is

312
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,360
something that I have been totally

313
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:14,430
guilty of for most of my life because I

314
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,590
can be a perfectionist I want to get

315
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:18,360
things right on the first try but what

316
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:20,700
college taught me is that you just have

317
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,410
to take that leap of faith and go with

318
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,330
your gut and you will figure it out

319
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:27,270
along the way okay so question number

320
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:28,440
three that I got is scholarships and I

321
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,450
actually got a couple different

322
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:33,150
questions about scholarships and college

323
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:35,280
finances are really a case-by-case basis

324
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:37,560
for everyone's financial situation so

325
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,810
I'm just going to talk briefly about my

326
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,250
college experience applying for

327
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:43,950
scholarships and just keep it a little

328
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:45,500
bit general honestly so I kind of split

329
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:48,240
up scholarships into three different

330
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,200
buckets if you will there's the private

331
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,690
scholarships

332
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,970
there's FAFSA scholarships and then

333
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:56,190
there's scholarships through your school

334
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:57,990
which is like super general and then in

335
00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:00,660
addition to that scholarships can be

336
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:03,360
awarded for all different reasons they

337
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:05,120
can be specific to your major they can

338
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,980
be based on your academic merit

339
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,840
athletics are a big one sometimes there

340
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:13,230
is even scholarships for like minorities

341
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:14,820
or your financial situation so there are

342
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:16,890
all different types of scholarships and

343
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:19,050
it can be super overwhelming to figure

344
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:21,120
out okay like which ones do I even apply

345
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:23,640
to so I'll just briefly share my

346
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,530
experience with scholarships so I

347
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,810
applied to the bulk of my scholarships

348
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:29,640
my freshman year of college and my

349
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:31,920
freshman year I think was when I had the

350
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:34,830
most scholarships as well I think I had

351
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,830
one or two private scholarships I got

352
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:39,660
some through FAFSA and luckily that year

353
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:41,340
too they said like these scholarships

354
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:44,220
will carry over throughout your entire

355
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:46,950
time at college and then I also got some

356
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:49,350
based on my high school GPA that really

357
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:51,030
helped out for my freshman tuition so I

358
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:53,670
did the bulk of my scholarship

359
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:56,400
applications my senior year of high

360
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:59,750
school and then after that I continued

361
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:02,900
to apply for FAFSA every year and then I

362
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:05,570
to apply to my University's kind of Bank

363
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:08,360
of scholarships Oregon State just had

364
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:09,590
like one or two scholarship applications

365
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,540
where you just put in all of your

366
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:13,400
information and they would kind of

367
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:15,620
disseminate it from there and pick the

368
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,210
right scholarships for you so it was a

369
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:19,730
really nice like one and done

370
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:22,040
application and I didn't have to apply

371
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:23,870
to like a plethora of scholarships to

372
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,670
try and get money to help with my

373
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:28,160
tuition so with that being said

374
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:30,260
scholarship applications can be a super

375
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,950
lengthy process and I think that if you

376
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:34,940
have the time it is well worth it to

377
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:36,700
dedicate that time to scholarship

378
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:39,200
applications however my personal

379
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:42,980
experience was private scholarships just

380
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:44,930
weren't worth my personal time I did get

381
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:47,740
enough financial assistance from the

382
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:50,510
university based on my academic success

383
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:52,670
to help me with my tuition so I stopped

384
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:55,670
applying for private scholarships after

385
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:58,010
my freshman year but it's totally up to

386
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:59,510
you in your financial situation but just

387
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:01,640
some general advice what I've noticed

388
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:04,220
from different scholarship applications

389
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:06,890
is that they just want to see what sets

390
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:09,350
you apart from your peers what makes you

391
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:11,690
unique what is your story and what do

392
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:13,910
you plan to set out to do you know like

393
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:16,040
with your major and with your career

394
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:17,870
dreams so in a lot of ways you can look

395
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,610
at a scholarship application almost like

396
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:22,250
a job application you want to put your

397
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:24,260
best foot forward and show why you are

398
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,730
the best candidate for that scholarship

399
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:27,260
and for that opportunity

400
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:29,570
already I think we are on to question

401
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:36,070
number four now and my mouth is getting

402
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:39,980
dry from talking so much so okay so

403
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:41,960
question number four I believe is how do

404
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:44,960
you find a job in the career field

405
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:46,880
you're interested in during college to

406
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:49,300
see if you like the career okay so I

407
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,380
briefly touched on this and my answer to

408
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,520
figuring out what you want to major and

409
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,290
I think about starting with

410
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:57,320
informational interviews and job

411
00:14:54,290 --> 00:15:00,350
shadowing once again amazing way to get

412
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:02,190
like hands-on first-hand experience with

413
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:04,590
a job position that you're in

414
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:07,230
and reaching up to your personal network

415
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:09,210
or your professors or the alumni network

416
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:10,770
at your school to find industry

417
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:12,600
professionals who are in a position that

418
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:14,910
you're interested in to see if you can

419
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,400
just have 30 minutes or an hour of their

420
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:19,380
time to talk to them about their job

421
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:21,900
experience also I don't think I've

422
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:24,150
mentioned this yet but LinkedIn amazing

423
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:26,610
amazing networking platform pretty sure

424
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:28,530
every business student swears by this I

425
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:30,060
have so much I can say about LinkedIn

426
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:32,490
and using it as a platform to your

427
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:35,640
advantage but I'm gonna save that for my

428
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:37,860
career Q&A coming baby soon but yes

429
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,750
LinkedIn amazing place to find

430
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:42,060
connections for informational interviews

431
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:43,920
and job shadows okay so we are just on

432
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:47,190
to question number five how do you

433
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,750
juggle work and school so this is a

434
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:51,240
question that I got from one of my

435
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:53,490
followers on Instagram so I share a lot

436
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,740
of my life on Instagram they know me a

437
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:57,090
lot better than you guys probably do so

438
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:59,160
I'll just share a little bit of like

439
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:01,680
what I was doing during college and why

440
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,540
I probably got this question so my goal

441
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:07,440
of the four years that I was in college

442
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:10,470
was to do everything I possibly could to

443
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,300
get a job after graduation that was my

444
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:14,760
number one goal of these four years and

445
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:16,980
I just did everything that it took to

446
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:19,380
set me up for success to get a job with

447
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:22,290
that being said I spent most of my free

448
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:24,330
time working part-time jobs that had

449
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:26,400
some sort of segue into my career or

450
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:28,620
building my own business as a fashion

451
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,300
blogger and social media content creator

452
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:33,810
so with that being said for the last

453
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:36,060
four years I was a full-time honors

454
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:38,130
student in college and also working 30

455
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:40,380
to 40 hours a week on top of that

456
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:42,600
between my part-time job and building my

457
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:46,350
business and looking back on it now I

458
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:48,450
was literally crazy to do that like I

459
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:50,580
like I don't I don't know how I got

460
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:52,770
through the last four years to be honest

461
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:55,980
I think that I have chronic stress and

462
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:57,870
I'm also a self-proclaimed workaholic so

463
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:00,450
that probably explains how I got through

464
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:02,520
it but also at the end of the day I just

465
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:04,680
didn't really mind putting in the work

466
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,660
because I knew that it would pay off in

467
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:08,850
the long run and you know what it did

468
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:11,160
because I got a full-time job and

469
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:12,030
exactly what I wanted to do three months

470
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,310
before I even

471
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:16,560
we did from college so hard work pays

472
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:19,140
off delayed gratification can feel

473
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:21,930
amazing when you actually get it in yout

474
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:24,210
for me juggling work in school I just I

475
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:26,970
just grinded through it honestly it was

476
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:29,010
sheer grit and work ethic and thinking

477
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:30,270
about how it was going to pay off in the

478
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:32,820
long run I just knew it was something

479
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:36,120
that I had to do to be successful also I

480
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:39,630
am like a super planner organizer type-a

481
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:41,850
person so I lived by my planner I did a

482
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:44,310
lot of time management and also

483
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:46,740
prioritizing all of my work and school

484
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:48,510
tasks to make the most of my time as

485
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,340
possible and be really productive every

486
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:51,960
single day and week I've actually been

487
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,360
thinking about doing a video about that

488
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,040
because I have a planner that I swear by

489
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:58,260
and kind of like a system for

490
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,550
prioritizing my tasks so if that's

491
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,530
something you guys would be interested

492
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:03,960
in let me know and I can make that video

493
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:06,090
too okay on to the next question another

494
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,700
big topic a lot of college students are

495
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:11,040
interested in which is internships more

496
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,020
specifically how do I get one and is it

497
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:15,060
essential to have an internship so also

498
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:16,770
depending on what sort of industry

499
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,430
you're going into the importance of an

500
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:20,310
internship

501
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:22,200
I'm sure varies however in general I

502
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:25,230
think that internships are an amazing

503
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,730
opportunity to get a real taste of the

504
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:29,280
job and career that you could be

505
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:31,710
possibly going into it is an amazing way

506
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,570
to set yourself apart experience and

507
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:35,850
resume wise when you're applying for

508
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:38,100
full-time jobs and it's also an amazing

509
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:39,990
opportunity to get experience working

510
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,640
for a company that you're interested in

511
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:43,890
because I also think that the company

512
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,810
that you work for is just as important

513
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,950
as the job that you're actually doing I

514
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:49,110
just think that like the overall

515
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:50,670
workplace culture and the people that

516
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:52,350
you surround yourself with are just as

517
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:54,030
important as the actual job that you're

518
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:56,010
doing so so figuring out the right

519
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:57,810
company for you is also a good question

520
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:59,310
to ask yourself with that being said I

521
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:01,140
don't think that it's absolutely

522
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:04,100
essential that you have an internship

523
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:06,870
during college to get a full-time job

524
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:09,240
afterwards I actually didn't have an

525
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:11,730
internship during college and I still

526
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:14,880
got a job before I graduated I think

527
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:17,310
more importantly it's about how you use

528
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,520
your time in college and if you can get

529
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:20,410
experience in an

530
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:22,150
in a way that doesn't explicitly have

531
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:24,670
the word internship and it that is

532
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:27,130
totally fine and still very applicable

533
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:29,860
my mindset about internships though was

534
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:31,780
totally different my sophomore in junior

535
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:34,030
year when I was gearing up to apply to

536
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:35,410
internships so backtrack to a couple

537
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:37,360
years ago when I was considering

538
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:41,020
internships I thought it was absolutely

539
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:43,000
essential to have one and my dream idea

540
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:45,580
was that I was going to intern at a

541
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,560
company I was interested in basically

542
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:49,510
like one of their kind of training

543
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:51,370
programs for college students and it was

544
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:54,130
almost expected that once you went

545
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:56,500
through that internship program you

546
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:58,780
would be offered a full-time job your

547
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:00,310
summer before senior year and then that

548
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,450
job would kind of be waiting for you

549
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:05,590
when you graduated

550
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:07,450
that was my like dream plan a what I

551
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:09,430
wanted to happen as a merchandising

552
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:12,010
major when I thought that I wanted to be

553
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:13,510
a buyer or merchandise or something like

554
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:16,090
that that was kind of like the dream

555
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:18,850
path that you would go in so a little

556
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:21,880
bit of a spoiler alert I did get to the

557
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:23,830
final interview of my dream company

558
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,570
dream internship what I had always

559
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:28,570
wanted to do I had my final interview

560
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:31,110
and I didn't get accepted to their

561
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:34,900
internship program and I was absolutely

562
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:37,420
gutted because my plan a of what I had

563
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:39,520
been working so hard for to get what I

564
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:40,840
thought that I was qualified for didn't

565
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,580
end up working out for me

566
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,590
and it took me a little bit honestly to

567
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:46,420
like pick myself up off the ground and

568
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:48,850
convince myself that I wasn't a failure

569
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:51,160
because that's what I felt like at that

570
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:54,040
time but honestly looking back now that

571
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:56,260
rejection was just a redirection for me

572
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,670
and a kind sight I am so glad I didn't

573
00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:00,340
get that internship because it would

574
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:02,530
have set me down another path that now

575
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:03,940
I'd actually realized isn't right for me

576
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:06,850
I don't know what that story is

577
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:09,490
depressing or hopeful for you guys but I

578
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:11,410
hope that I can be living proof that you

579
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:13,360
don't need an internship to get a

580
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:16,420
full-time job and it's really just about

581
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:18,310
the overall experience that you have in

582
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:20,770
college that sets you apart as a

583
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:23,560
candidate so because I didn't get that

584
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:24,740
internship I buckled down and spend even

585
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,690
more time

586
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:28,940
building my own business and getting

587
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:31,610
experience in social media marketing

588
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:33,710
building out my portfolio through my

589
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:35,540
college classes because once I picked

590
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:37,490
myself up I was like you know what I

591
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:40,850
didn't get this internship I'm not going

592
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:43,220
to have formal experience in this area

593
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:45,050
but there are still so many things that

594
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:46,760
I can do getting like informal

595
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:49,520
experience and learning as much as I can

596
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:51,770
by myself to still set me apart as a job

597
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,750
candidate so that's what I did in place

598
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:55,850
of having an internship I just buckled

599
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:57,730
down and did the work myself made an

600
00:21:55,850 --> 00:22:00,320
opportunity for myself and that is

601
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:03,559
really what benefited me in the long run

602
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:06,190
okay chugging right along next question

603
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:09,170
is how much networking should I do in

604
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:10,670
college okay okay my answer might be a

605
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:11,990
little bit biased I don't know if this

606
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:14,929
is the same for every single industry

607
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:18,170
but networking in business and as a

608
00:22:14,929 --> 00:22:20,720
business student is like everything so

609
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:23,120
my answer is going to be network as much

610
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,610
as you possibly can in college

611
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,830
especially for business majors I really

612
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:29,690
think it's about who you know as much as

613
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:31,460
what you know there are so many

614
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:33,530
opportunities that just come up because

615
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:36,500
of the connections that you have in your

616
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:38,809
network and being being and knowing the

617
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:40,910
right place at the right time so if your

618
00:22:38,809 --> 00:22:43,610
school has networking events please

619
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:45,679
please go to them especially at these

620
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:47,420
networking events like employers and

621
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,550
professionals are there because they

622
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:51,230
want to talk to students they want to

623
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:52,970
give you advice they want to connect

624
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:54,890
with you and this is just like a free

625
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:57,200
pass to shake the hand and introduce

626
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:58,850
yourself to a professional and like you

627
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,710
don't have to do any of the like work to

628
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:02,270
like cold call them or anything like

629
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:04,190
that they are there right in front of

630
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:06,350
you at that networking event and it's an

631
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:08,990
amazing opportunity to connect with them

632
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:11,210
employers also love to see initiative

633
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:12,890
from students if you are still a college

634
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:14,630
student and you're already introducing

635
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:16,880
yourself to people in the industry that

636
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:19,040
is amazing and proactive and please

637
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,440
please do it if you're interested in

638
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,780
learning more about how to network how

639
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,970
to leverage your network to get a job I

640
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:28,790
will also be talking about that in my

641
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:30,470
career Q&A so part two of this video

642
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:32,630
okay I think we've covered all of the

643
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:33,810
questions about like college experience

644
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:36,090
so we're kind of gonna jump

645
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:38,430
ship into more of like the job

646
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:40,800
application process as you're coming up

647
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:42,810
on graduation in your senior year so the

648
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:46,260
next question that I got is when do I

649
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:49,710
start applying for jobs so I started to

650
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:53,070
apply for jobs my Spring Break of senior

651
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:54,990
year which was about three months out to

652
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:57,510
graduation I felt like that was kind of

653
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:59,730
the sweet spot of like hey I'm coming up

654
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:01,530
on graduation I can start working at

655
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:03,300
this time so it was like close enough

656
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:05,580
that the employer would actually be able

657
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:08,550
to hire me in like a timely fashion but

658
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:11,580
I also had enough time to apply to a

659
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:13,260
number of jobs possibly get rejected go

660
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:15,180
through the interview process apply to

661
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:16,800
more jobs it was just like I think that

662
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:20,070
the three-month mark was just like a

663
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:22,500
nice buffer to prepare me for whatever

664
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:24,870
might happen in that timeframe but I

665
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:28,110
actually started to kind of prospect a

666
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:31,020
job search I would say my winter term of

667
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:33,720
senior year starting like I think it was

668
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:36,840
over a holiday break I was already

669
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:38,580
looking at job positions not necessarily

670
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,590
once I was going to applying to but just

671
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:43,020
seeing like okay what companies are

672
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:45,120
hiring right now what types of jobs are

673
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:47,400
available I was just being super

674
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,650
proactive and kind of feeling out the

675
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:51,360
job market six months before I was going

676
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:54,120
to graduate so yeah if you want to be

677
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,620
super proactive and on top of things you

678
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,960
know it doesn't hurt to start looking

679
00:24:55,620 --> 00:25:00,270
early but I think that kind of

680
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,950
three-month last term or semester of

681
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:04,740
senior year is the best time to start

682
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:06,210
applying okay next job question I got is

683
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:08,790
how many jobs

684
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:10,860
should I be applying for so after giving

685
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:12,330
those questions some thought I think to

686
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:14,430
make the most of your time because like

687
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:16,020
first and foremost you're already a

688
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:19,020
full-time college student and now you

689
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:21,600
have to throw applying to jobs on top of

690
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:23,220
your already super busy schedule I think

691
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,900
to make the most of your time the best

692
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:26,790
thing that you can do is to compile a

693
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:30,480
list of job postings you're interested

694
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:33,060
in let's say like 10 to 15 that you are

695
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,790
interested in applying for of those pick

696
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:37,560
your top five and your top 5 jobs are

697
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:39,690
like I love this company I love the

698
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:41,220
sound of this position I think that I

699
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:44,040
would be a really good candidate for

700
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:46,380
this and focus your time and energy

701
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:49,140
on those five applications and make them

702
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:51,750
the best you possibly can instead of

703
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:53,130
like spreading yourself then over 20

704
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:55,350
different job applications and just

705
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:56,880
hoping that one of them comes back and

706
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:58,650
says that they want to interview you

707
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,360
I think prioritizing your time and

708
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:02,130
effort to the jobs that you are most

709
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:04,560
interested in is the best thing to do

710
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:06,120
and once you start hearing back from

711
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,130
those then start putting out your job

712
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:10,830
applications to the rest of your list

713
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:11,790
and kind of just go from there and the

714
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:13,740
reason that I think you should

715
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:16,710
prioritize your job applications is

716
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:19,140
because most the time your application

717
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:21,210
is the first impression that a company

718
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:23,580
is getting of you and you want to make

719
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:26,130
it the best possible impression that you

720
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:28,020
can so don't half-ass your job

721
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:29,790
applications don't just send the same

722
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:31,560
resume to every single place and hope

723
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:33,570
that one of them likes it I know this

724
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:35,160
video is already getting super long so

725
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:38,100
once again I'm going to be talking about

726
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:40,440
like resumes cover letters interview

727
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:42,600
tips portfolio those things like that

728
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,830
and my career QA but yeah hopefully that

729
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,020
answers your question of how many jobs

730
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:48,090
you should be applying for okay final

731
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:50,730
question is for anyone interested in

732
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:52,860
going into the marketing industry so I

733
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:54,780
got a question that says if I'm not a

734
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:57,510
marketing major how do I get into the

735
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:59,580
marketing industry and I feel like this

736
00:26:57,510 --> 00:27:01,830
question was just made for me so I

737
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:03,180
majored in merchandising management

738
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:06,120
which is like a fashion and business

739
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:08,880
degree and I ended up getting a job as a

740
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:10,770
social media and marketing manager so I

741
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,410
think this question needs to be narrowed

742
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:15,300
down a little bit into what type of role

743
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:17,670
in marketing do you want because there

744
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:19,200
are so many different roles in marketing

745
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:20,670
and figuring out how you're going to get

746
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,730
your foot in the door in that type of

747
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:26,340
position really varies but like I said

748
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:28,800
before job shadows informational

749
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:30,810
interviews and looking for like an

750
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,950
entry-level job in the industry is a

751
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:33,840
great way to get your foot in the door

752
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:36,360
because I was interested in going into

753
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,250
like social media and advertising I did

754
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:40,800
a number of informational interviews and

755
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:42,300
advertising agencies to figure out if

756
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,760
that was something I was interested in

757
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:47,010
and like spoiler informational

758
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:49,590
interviews are a time for obviously

759
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:51,690
you'd ask them questions about their job

760
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:55,230
and the company but it's also an

761
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:57,960
opportunity to introduce yourself and

762
00:27:55,230 --> 00:28:00,450
like if them your resume tell them about

763
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:02,610
your experience so that's how I leverage

764
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:04,950
those informational interviews and I

765
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:06,419
highly recommend that you do the same as

766
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:07,860
far as different marketing roles go

767
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:10,820
though there are a lot of ways that once

768
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:12,870
again you can get informal experience or

769
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:15,780
qualifications to kind of boost your

770
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:17,520
resume as a candidate so depending on

771
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:19,190
what kind of marketing role you are

772
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,299
interested in there are tons of

773
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:24,870
certifications that you can get like

774
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:27,120
Google Analytics HootSuite you can learn

775
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:29,100
about Shopify I'm just rattling off a

776
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,110
couple different things you really need

777
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:32,610
to do research on the types of positions

778
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:34,679
you're interested in and what

779
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:37,200
qualifications they typically expect

780
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:39,480
because a lot of those can be obtained

781
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,790
through like online marketing courses

782
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:44,190
that you can do in your free time I also

783
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:45,960
think that working on marketing projects

784
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:48,270
like if you're still in school is an

785
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:50,700
amazing way to have something to show

786
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:52,200
for like tangible experience it's

787
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:54,630
something that you've been working on in

788
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,940
the marketing realm and like any other

789
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:59,400
industry not just in marketing just try

790
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:01,470
and learn as much as you possibly can on

791
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:04,770
your own and get as much experience as

792
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:06,990
you can I am a firm believer to make an

793
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:09,450
opportunity for yourself if there isn't

794
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:11,520
one there so I really paved my own path

795
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:14,460
to get into the social media marketing

796
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:16,770
industry because I was building up my

797
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:19,020
own social media platforms and by the

798
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:21,419
time I graduated I had four years of

799
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:22,799
experience managing my own social media

800
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:24,720
accounts and that's what made me a

801
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:27,450
really strong candidate even though I

802
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,010
didn't major in marketing oh my gosh I

803
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:31,169
need to take a deep breath I need to

804
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:33,150
