1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,319
what's up sling schlongs I've tried to

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:12,840
film this video like six times already

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:15,240
so just update you guys a little bit why

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,340
I loved you know wasn't feeling very

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,869
motivated to make videos and I was

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,970
making a lot in the summer but there's a

7
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:23,670
lot of sponsors and with like fash

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,680
fashion brands man you know I'm like I'm

9
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,449
over it conflicted on this subject of

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,480
fash fashion but I'm definitely a

11
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:31,969
thrifty thrifter heart so if there's any

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,399
more fashion Tings

13
00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:38,160
probably will be thrifted one so yeah

14
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:41,550
also people and Germany just like art

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,890
not I don't know I don't want to make a

16
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,020
big assumption but if you bought the

17
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,420
Bauhaus that I've met people who are a

18
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,620
bit older they're not like they don't

19
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,620
understand social media they don't

20
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:57,680
understand why it's happening and I just

21
00:00:52,620 --> 00:01:01,320
feel like judged and attacked because

22
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,390
you don't think no I'm not attacked by

23
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,119
anyone but it's just not something that

24
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:08,400
I like tell people that I have what's

25
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:10,830
your Instagram let's hear you this that

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,960

social media and how I want to use it

29
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:19,140

53
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:17,680
amazing I've met some super dope ash

54
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:20,800
people and it's incredible like I feel

55
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,270
in real life especially on Erasmus first

56
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,990
month you're like partying with everyone

57
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:27,940
getting crunk as hell and then you

58
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:30,430
realize you're like most of these people

59
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,900
like I don't connect with any of you we

60
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,820
don't really have similar hobbies of

61
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,860
course I don't want to say I didn't make

62
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:38,440
any bomb friends because I did there's

63
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:40,480
so many amazing people also in second

64
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,920
semester that I like finally got around

65
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,620
to meeting and then they're just all

66
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:48,820
[ __ ] left

67
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:51,459
um but yeah like it's crazy that I

68
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:54,730
didn't do anything well I made videos

69
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:59,890
but I just like everyone that I've met

70
00:02:54,730 --> 00:03:04,390
is so kind hearted and lovely freaking

71
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:06,820
real people just like I relate to and

72
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:09,400
it's [ __ ] amazing I can just trust

73
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:11,110
your judgement that if you like me and

74
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,390
think we'll be friends then we'll be

75
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:14,230
friends and like so far worked a hundred

76
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:16,269
percent of the time because I've

77
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:21,370
genuinely loved every single person that

78
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:22,750
I've met in Paris Leon Berlin Lisbon but

79
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,579
also in couchsurfing a lot which is a

80
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:26,860
complete different experience I'd rather

81
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:28,780
just like I don't know you guys don't

82
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,280
really on couchsurfing but I wish like I

83
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,829
could just go surf and hang out with you

84
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,780
guys instead because no I don't know

85
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:37,989
couchsurfing is an interesting thing I

86
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:40,030
recommend it I think it's a very unique

87
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:42,850
way to meet people that you wouldn't

88
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:44,829
otherwise me and like you have to have

89
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:46,989
conversations with them for a long time

90
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:48,790
because you're like living in their

91
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:51,190
house so like you really get to know

92
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:52,570
someone and they could be a lot older

93
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:56,350
than you they could just be really

94
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:58,720
different like one guy was like he

95
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:02,270
literally said he thought white men were

96
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:05,060
genetically more attractive

97
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:07,880
and I was like really because you're

98
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:10,550
[ __ ] 30 and balding and your face

99
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:13,970
looks frumpy and sad and you're like

100
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:19,040
complaining about how you can't find a

101
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:25,490
girlfriend in dirt dirt Dutch land halt

102
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:28,730
Netherlands um and he basically like has

103
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:30,560
only dated people in places where he has

104
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:32,360
an advantage as a foreigner so like in

105
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,640
Newark say you're like in Tokyo because

106
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:37,160
apparently like all girls there but for

107
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:41,630
white guys which I'm like okay whatever

108
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:43,640
like you're sad um but like I wasn't

109
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:47,540
even like mad at him I just felt really

110
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:50,120
sad for him because like that's [ __ ]

111
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:52,880
sad and also a lot of people have been

112
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:56,210
asking about sub and how he's doing he's

113
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:59,840
doing great he's just the [ __ ]

114
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:02,390
go I love him forever seriously like

115
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:07,310
he's one of my favorite people in this

116
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:12,020
entire universe and we did break up in

117
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:13,610
October and it was really flipping hard

118
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:16,610
for me I didn't see it coming it was

119
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:19,390
like a big punch or like a brick thrown

120
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:24,020
in my face maybe like acid I don't know

121
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:26,360
but you know I think it was really good

122
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:29,210
for me because I was able to like step

123
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:31,160
back and see the relationship and maybe

124
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:32,660
it wasn't really working because we

125
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,240
don't want the same thing in the future

126
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:38,210
I don't know I still love him to death

127
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:41,630
and I saw him last month when I went to

128
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:45,920
Portugal to visit him and it was so nice

129
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:48,770
to hang out and just be my complete 100

130
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:53,540
percent gross self and like fart freely

131
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:56,840
and just be disgusting and be accepted

132
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:58,730
and not judged best feeling ever

133
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,950
that's like a real true friend I just

134
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:03,740
think we're always gonna be BFFs I would

135
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:05,840
take a freaking bullet or two or three

136
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:10,010
or four or five or a million for this

137
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:11,340
kid and yeah like sometimes I'm so sad

138
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:14,160
about it and some

139
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:18,120
they cry and like that's okay that's

140
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:21,750
just bugging emotions man and I think

141
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:23,400
it's like natural human senses and if

142
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:26,060
you're not sad that maybe you're just

143
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:29,729
dead I am seeing someone now who's

144
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:33,900
really wonderful and I didn't really

145
00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:37,500
expect or anticipate or want to be in a

146
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:40,229
relationship again so soon but it kind

147
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:42,540
of just happened and I just decided like

148
00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:44,550
you should can't control life and what

149
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:47,790
happens and when you meet people so you

150
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:49,500
just have to take it as it is and I

151
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:51,240
think it would have been a really big

152
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:55,250
shame if I was like no I don't want to

153
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:59,330
get to know you because blah you know so

154
00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:04,650

155
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:06,990
like yeah I'm going next week to Greece

00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:24,980
shattered it is like

182
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:27,390
I don't know if you can see this but

183
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:29,070
this from afar maybe it looks like an

184
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:34,100
iPhone or something if you really go

185
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:37,020
back a far but this is a samsung galaxy

186
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:40,169
s5 I remember when this came out in

187
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:41,820
grade 11 and one guy my class had it and

188
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:45,450
was like dipping it into water and now I

189
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:50,190
have it in 2018 when everyone else has

190
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:51,240
like an iPhone 300 so that's fine

191
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:53,520
whatever

192
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,350
I think I might just force myself to buy

193
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,570
a proper phone because this one's really

194
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:58,980
cracked so slow like I don't realize how

195
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:01,950
bad my phone is until I use other

196
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:04,170
people's phones and I'm like yours

197
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:08,490

198
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:13,010

199
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:16,890

200
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:20,700
stopped using my bullet journal um in

00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:23,910
March February yeah and I've been using

202
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:25,350

203
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:28,860

207
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:37,620

208
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:41,160
notebook with ideas and journaling and

209
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:44,370
