seeking to fill your curiosity or you're

31
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,640
trying to gain some relatability just

32
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,590
because of the nature of the video I'm

33
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,479
gonna be talking about what it was like

34
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,960
growing up Asian it's called the growing

35
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:26,880
up Asian American tag and I'm kind of

36
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,460
new to the YouTube world

37
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,320
obviously and I just feel like I don't

38
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,610
know when this tag actually started but

39
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,320
because it's Chinese New Year's I've

40
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,299
been inspired and I just thought it'd be

41
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,070

42
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:39,960

and I know all you Asian Americans can

58
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:17,980
relate to me when I say like how many

59
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:20,379
times people ask me this question and oh

60
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:21,970
my god it's so annoying especially when

61
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:23,140

62
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:27,879

65
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,069
you know like whatever moving on to the

66
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,069
next question

67
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:40,500
what generation are you so I was

68
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,700
actually born in southern China I'm

69
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,750
gonna put a map up right now so yeah

70
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,820
that's where I was born

71
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:52,350
it's Q Ming or my pronunciation in

72
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:54,090
Chinese is very bad yeah it's really

73
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:57,030
embarrassed roast me I took me a lot to

74
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:59,280
actually say that but yeah so um I was

75
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:01,290
born in southern China and I became

76
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,890
asian-american aka I became an American

77
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:07,410
citizen when I was adopted right before

78
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:09,830
2000 and I've been Asian American ever

79
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,830
since

80
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:15,000
question is what is the first time that

81
00:03:12,689 --> 00:03:17,640
you felt different / you felt like you

82
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,189
were a minority and there's a few

83
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,900
difference I guess I will talk about my

84
00:03:20,189 --> 00:03:23,909
first different is when I felt different

85
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,530
and it didn't feel good or bad my second

86
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:27,090
different is when it felt different and

87
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:29,010
negative and then my third different

88
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:31,470
when it felt different and positive so

89
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:33,239
I'm gonna get started with that my first

90
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:35,819
time I felt different I was in

91
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:37,590
kindergarten and I my teacher was going

92
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:39,840
over the continents and it was like you

93
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:43,349
know North America South America Europe

94
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:46,049
Australia Australia Europe Asia Africa

95
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:47,400
Australia and I just remember that

96
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:52,129
remember she pointed to me I was like

97
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,129
gee like you're from Asia and I was like

98
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,739
[Music]

99
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:59,849
no seriously in all seriousness I

100
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,620
remember that and I really felt

101
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:03,840
indifferent like I was like oh okay and

102
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,519
the funniest part was going up because I

103
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,470
was adopted my parents are not Asian

104
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,569
they're not the same race as me but they

105
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:12,209
always made sure to make me feel like I

106
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:14,549
was valued despite that and that it

107
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:17,789
didn't matter as much what my grace was

108
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:19,349
but it mattered way more like what kind

109
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:21,180
of person I was and how I treated

110
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:23,610
everybody and how I was treated by other

111
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:26,039
people like that mattered so much more

112
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,150
and so I always kind of felt like I was

113
00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:29,330
different but my mom would always be

114
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:32,070
like no you're my baby like you know

115
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:34,710
like it doesn't matter so I was like

116
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:36,979
okay but then when I got to kindergarten

117
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:42,060
and my teacher said that I was just like

118
00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:43,510
wow I knew it like I was seriously on

119
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:46,180
some

120
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:47,950
um yeah so that's basically it kind of

121
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,390
confirmed my suspicions that I was

122
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:50,890
different but other than that I didn't

123
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:53,800
really feel positive or negative about

124
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:57,210
it at the time so then next you know the

125
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:59,560
first time I felt negative about being I

126
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:01,780
guess the first time I felt negative

127
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,760
about being different it's kind of hard

128
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:05,140
to pinpoint an exact time because I was

129
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,510
so young and it's kind of hard to

130
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:09,700
pinpoint it but also because it would

131
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:11,260
happen so frequently the first thing was

132
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,780
that there was this Nursery Rhyme where

133
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:15,640
it would go like Chinese Japanese dirty

134
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:17,290
knees money please and I don't remember

135
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,210
the beginning but that was the end part

136
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:20,740
of it I think and during the Chinese

137
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:22,810
Japanese part you know people would do

138
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:24,100
that little like Chinese Japanese like

139
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:26,800
with their eyes like making their eyes

140
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:28,690
look slanted and I remember that in

141
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,980
itself made me feel bad for some reason

142
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:32,260
like I remember I would feel kind of

143
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:34,120
embarrassed and sad when people would do

144
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:36,100
that thing with their eyes because and I

145
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,660
didn't even know why actually and it was

146
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,100
weird because I don't understand it so

147
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,480
how would I ever explain that to

148
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:43,450
somebody else that's how I felt at the

149
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:45,190
time and I remember this girl turned to

150
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:46,360
me I was just like oh my god she like

151
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,580
you don't have to do that part because

152
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,410
you're already tiny he's like your eyes

153
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:52,360
already like that and for some reason

154
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:54,430
that hurt my feelings a lot like I

155
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,860
remember thinking about that all day and

156
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:58,540
just being upset about it and you know

157
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,820
wondering why my eyes were different

158
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:03,190
from everybody else's and you know it

159
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:05,140
hurt a lot at the time and it's weird

160
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:06,820
because now I can put words to all my

161
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,440
emotions I'm feeling but back then when

162
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,840
I was younger I didn't have them I

163
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,490
didn't have the maturity to understand

164
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,050
what I was feeling to kind of explain it

165
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:16,600
to myself so you know what's interesting

166
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:21,310
looking back but the first time I felt

167
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:23,050
um different in a positive way and wow

168
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:24,970
we're starting early I do feel kind of

169
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:28,150
emotional about this because it means so

170
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:30,630
much to me um I didn't start feeling

171
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:33,520
different in a positive way I would say

172
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:36,100
until I almost got to college I'm not

173
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:39,340
gonna lie and a big thing that changed a

174
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:40,930
lot for me I'm not going to lie was the

175
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,490
black lives matter movement believe it

176
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,960
or not and it's because I feel like that

177
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:46,540
movement was a movement that kind of

178
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:49,420
started the ripple effect of everybody

179
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:51,460
talking about the ways they're you know

180
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:53,440
perspective in America as a minority is

181
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,529
and you know that was the first time

182
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,779
being different was really

183
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:58,549
valued and being like foreign quote

184
00:06:56,779 --> 00:07:00,259
unquote started coming into play and

185
00:06:58,549 --> 00:07:02,209
that kind of feel like I feel like kind

186
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:03,769
of started the ball rolling for a lot of

187
00:07:02,209 --> 00:07:06,439
these other things that are going on now

188
00:07:03,769 --> 00:07:08,779
and I think that's when I was finally

189
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:10,759
realizing like around that time that I

190
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:12,859
was like being foreign and being an

191
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:17,719
immigrant and being looking different

192
00:07:12,859 --> 00:07:20,479
and being notably not from here is good

193
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:22,669
and that's when I finally clicked where

194
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,709
I was just like guys like I'm happy

195
00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:26,869
being chinese-american I'm happy being

196
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:28,729
American I'm not here to settle for

197
00:07:26,869 --> 00:07:30,289
anything less I don't want people to see

198
00:07:28,729 --> 00:07:31,819
me as anything different I want to be

199
00:07:30,289 --> 00:07:34,489
asian-american and that's where it

200
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:36,979
really finally ran home guys also

201
00:07:34,489 --> 00:07:40,579
motional I'm so like it makes me feel so

202
00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:43,699
happy like to think about it like oh my

203
00:07:40,579 --> 00:07:45,409
god it's a lot a lot of feelings but it

204
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:47,209
also makes me happy because it makes me

205
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:49,489
like growing up and I don't know if

206
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:51,649
other comment down below if US also felt

207
00:07:49,489 --> 00:07:54,019
this way but I would constantly be

208
00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:56,089
worried about you know the future of my

209
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:58,009
kids and I know that's really weird but

210
00:07:56,089 --> 00:07:59,839
I would always worry that they would go

211
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:01,369
through the same exact thing as me and

212
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:04,249
they would have to deal with like I

213
00:08:01,369 --> 00:08:06,229
guess prejudices stereotyping and just

214
00:08:04,249 --> 00:08:08,779
that the embarrassment of being Asian

215
00:08:06,229 --> 00:08:11,299
and different but now I really really

216
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:13,219
really feel hopeful that being foreign

217
00:08:11,299 --> 00:08:15,379
being an immigrant all this lava is not

218
00:08:13,219 --> 00:08:18,019
a trend and that it will actually uphold

219
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:19,879
itself and I hope it does because I want

220
00:08:18,019 --> 00:08:20,689
so much better for my future kids and

221
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:22,639
that's so weird

222
00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:24,139
to say I know but I feel like that kind

223
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,669
of answers a lot and the question and

224
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:29,649
tells you guys even more about me so

225
00:08:25,669 --> 00:08:29,649
that's that next question

226
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:35,190
I'm always proud of your heritage or was

227
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:37,560
there time you rejected it um after that

228
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:40,080
last question I can't even front like of

229
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:42,150
course there was a lot of rejection of

230
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,610
me being Chinese me being immigrant me

231
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:47,190
being foreign a lot of it like I just

232
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:49,050
remember growing up I tried so hard to

233
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,730
fit in with the kids around me and

234
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:52,860
basically you know I was going to

235
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:54,900
schools all white kids basically and I

236
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:57,000
just remember one thing that really like

237
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:59,700
was like fives like I didn't do

238
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,050
something right like was that growing up

239
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,440
until I was in second grade

240
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:06,870
I couldn't say the th sound and I would

241
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,940
always say the D sound instead of th and

242
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:12,780
then finally one of my friends was like

243
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:14,340
it's not done its God and I was just

244
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:17,430
like yeah I remember thinking that I was

245
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:20,040
like oh man like I

246
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:22,260
like it was just like without me even

247
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,880
really consciously knowing it I was on

248
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,710
this mission to fit in with everybody

249
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,510
else and to act more American and

250
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:29,880
basically it meant act more white at the

251
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:32,610
time and I was just like man and then

252
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,890
throwing up that same theme kind of

253
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:36,240
ensued like when I was older you know

254
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,770
middle school high school a lot of my

255
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,480
friends would always tell me oh my god

256
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:41,279
she like you're Asian but I think of you

257
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,570
as white Arthur they'd be like your

258
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,490
agent that I don't really see you as

259
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:46,290
Asian or they'd be like your agent I

260
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:49,770
don't think of you as Asian and it's

261
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:53,070
weird because like why do I have to be

262
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:55,020
seen as not Asian to you like to make

263
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:56,220
you guys feel comfortable like that's

264
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:58,200
something I've always personally

265
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,880
wondered and it's not coming at anybody

266
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,709
but it's just a question that you know

267
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,270
maybe other people can evaluate deeper

268
00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:04,709
within themselves like why do you need

269
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,660
friends that are your own race for you

270
00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:08,490
to feel comfortable but I'm not gonna

271
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:10,080
get too deep not too philosophical I'm

272
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:12,720
still trying to keep a good vibe so

273
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,610
basically that is you know the times

274
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,560
I've rejected it was just constant

275
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:18,540
growing up constantly trying to fit in

276
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,610
and assembly and be like everybody else

277
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:22,200
around me and it's it's you know it's

278
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:24,630
funny because growing up like I feel

279
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,310
like Asian people when I was growing up

280
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:27,570
we're fit into three boxes and it was

281
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:29,520
that asian person trying to act white

282
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:31,380
the Asian person trying to act black and

283
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:34,500
then the Asian person who was just a fob

284
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:35,940
like completely foreign and I guess

285
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,560
because I was always surrounded by white

286
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:40,380
kids I just wanted to be that asian girl

287
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,940
who acted white and I always felt proud

288
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:44,070
when people said that about me so there

289
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:48,810
was always like that underlying you know

290
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:51,150
rejection of my culture but I do regret

291
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:53,190
and I do regret that now looking back at

292
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:55,890
it but at the same time I don't think me

293
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:58,110
my newfound pride I guess I being Asian

294
00:10:55,890 --> 00:11:00,600
would mean so much to me if I didn't go

295
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:02,640
through that growing up so you know it

296
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,829
is what it is there's a silver lining to

297
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,350
everything I guess but um yeah I

298
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:12,320
definitely rejected it growing up I I

299
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:12,320
felt proud you know so yeah

300
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:16,649
what are some stereotypes that you

301
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:19,019
struggle with guys the biggest

302
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:22,110
stereotype I struggled with growing up

303
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:23,819
was that shy docile quiet

304
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,019
you can't walk all over her you can't

305
00:11:23,819 --> 00:11:26,069
tell her anything she won't say anything

306
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:29,189
back

307
00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:30,930
asian girl stereotype and I struggle

308
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:33,029
with that a lot because honestly growing

309
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:34,290
up I was actually pretty shy like and I

310
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:36,209
don't want to be like those girls who's

311
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:37,769
like oh my god I'm so cocky I'm loud

312
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:39,990
with my friends and quiet with people I

313
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:41,879
don't know but that's really how I was

314
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,990
growing up I remember there sometimes in

315
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:45,300
dance classes where I would literally

316
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:46,680
just bury like this like under the bar

317
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,569
and wait for dance class to start and

318
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,279
not talk to anybody because I was so

319
00:11:48,569 --> 00:11:52,829
nervous and scared and I just you know

320
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:55,379
was socially awkward like you know I

321
00:11:52,829 --> 00:11:57,389
mean and I think that is really kind of

322
00:11:55,379 --> 00:11:59,279
what ade away at me when it came to that

323
00:11:57,389 --> 00:12:01,410
stereotype cuz I actually fit it and I

324
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,879
was like oh man like I don't want to be

325
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:04,500
like this I don't want to be that so

326
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:06,420
when I got to college I really started

327
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,939
and like expanding myself talking to

328
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:11,129
more people like doing new things and

329
00:12:08,939 --> 00:12:13,319
really just kind of like saying I don't

330
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:15,360
care and just doing what I wanted to do

331
00:12:13,319 --> 00:12:17,130
because you know I didn't want to fit

332
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:21,120
into that stereotype anymore so it's

333
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:23,550
crazy how that stereotype really drove

334
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,920
me to being who I was ultimately Who I

335
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:28,079
am today because I've worked so hard to

336
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,970
be the complete opposite of it so that's

337
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:32,040
the stereotype that I think has really

338
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:34,319
affected me the most I say another

339
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:37,230
stereotype is that Asian people just

340
00:12:34,319 --> 00:12:39,120
kind of like our goofy not goofy in a

341
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:42,060
positive way but goofy know like whoa

342
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,709
like what are you doing kind of way like

343
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,389
that type of thing I don't ever want

344
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:48,740
people to think that I'm just clumsy and

345
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:50,759
awkward because of that but you know I

346
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,930
don't know well like it's something I

347
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:53,610
struggle with but it's also not

348
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:55,889
something I've ever actually like

349
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:57,990
actively tried to change so I stuck with

350
00:12:55,889 --> 00:13:00,949
it a lot less than the shy awkward Asian

351
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:00,949
girl thing

352
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:09,710
okay next question can I speak Chinese

353
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:11,990
can I speak Mandarin ah no and I'm

354
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:13,940
pretty sad about this but the weirdest

355
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:15,920
thing is I can speak element very

356
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:18,230
elementary Mandarin like I can count to

357
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,970
ten I can say I love you I can say happy

358
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:21,800
new years how are you my name is like

359
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:23,990
you know random greetings like that I

360
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:26,990
know what my Chinese name means all that

361
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:28,370
stuff but I can't pronounce it really

362
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,990
well I know in the beginning of the

363
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:32,300
video I mentioned that my pronunciation

364
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:34,250
of something really bad at and I'm very

365
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,650
insecure to be honest about how I

366
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:38,180
pronounce Chinese words and I don't even

367
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:40,940
like to say I know any of them because

368
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:43,010
like you know it's just like what's the

369
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:44,420
point like I can't say it just I feel

370
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:47,570
like if I said it to a native Chinese

371
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:49,850
speaker they'd be like what like you

372
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:51,950
know what I mean like so I don't know I

373
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:53,600
just I kind of don't say it not because

374
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:55,550
I'm rejecting it like oh my god like

375
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,190
Chinese is bad nothing like that because

376
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:59,390
I did do that growing up but now it's

377
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:01,130
just kind of like I don't want to just

378
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:04,850
embarrass myself you know what I mean so

379
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:08,800
yes but not really and I can't have a

380
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:08,800
conversation so I would say mostly No

381
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:13,350
how has you being asian-american

382
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:15,540
affected your relationship with your

383
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:17,010
parents okay guys so this is gonna be a

384
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,990
little bit different just because I'm

385
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:20,550
adopted like I mentioned before but the

386
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:21,660
fact that I'm asian-american and the

387
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:24,630
fact that my parents are a different

388
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:26,760
race I feel like has never been an issue

389
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:28,800
with us like they've always made sure to

390
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,960
tell me that like at the end of the day

391
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,760
the thing that you need to worry about

392
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,440
is how you treat other people and I've

393
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,690
always kind of carried that with me

394
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,850
throughout my life and I think that they

395
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:40,260
did what they could to you know show me

396
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:43,320
my culture they told me about Chinese

397
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:44,880
holidays they took me to Chinese events

398
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:48,150
and they also sent me to Chinese school

399
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,830
on Saturdays and I just think because of

400
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:52,110
that it's made our relationship very

401
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:53,820
strong because they care about me being

402
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:55,050
Chinese and they care about me being in

403
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:57,270
touch with my culture and they care

404
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:59,820
about me caring about my culture which

405
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:02,820
is a huge thing but they also see me as

406
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:05,040
me they see past the outside of me and

407
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:07,110
they see the inside of my heart like you

408
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,030
don't know it makes me feel warm and

409
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:10,860
fuzzy whenever like people ask me

410
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:13,560
questions like this but at the end of

411
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:15,420
the day that's my mom and dad like

412
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,370
that's it you know I mean like our souls

413
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:18,840
were meant to be family like period and

414
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:20,490
that's why I feel like my relationship

415
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:22,560
is just so strong with them especially

416
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:24,540
because I'm Asian American because it

417
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,210
just shows that your love and your

418
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:29,250
family transcends you know biologic

419
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:31,560
stuff and like jeans and all that

420
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:33,270
because they they love me regardless so

421
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:36,020
I feel like that actually strengthened

422
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:36,020
my relationship

423
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:41,820
do you feel about your heritage now and

424
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,250
do you identify with it good question

425
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:45,930
okay so this one I would definitely say

426
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:49,170
that it's a loaded question as well

427
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:50,790
because my heritage to me means a lot

428
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:53,250
more than me just being Chinese because

429
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:55,500
it also means me being American like I'm

430
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:57,660
chinese-american to the fullest extent

431
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:59,160
the way I define being an American is

432
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:01,620
like someone who comes to this country

433
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,240
or someone who is currently in this

434
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:05,610
country and it's trying to do the best

435
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:08,190
they can to succeed and the best I can

436
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:10,260
to fulfill their own dreams and it's

437
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:11,190
just like I'm doing that like so to me

438
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,510
I'm an American

439
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:14,580
you know you mean I know not everyone

440
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:16,650
like would see me that way but that's

441
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:18,150
why I see myself I see myself as an

442
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:19,830
American I've worked hard to be an

443
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:23,010
American and all that stuff and it's

444
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:24,630
just like I just feel like you know at

445
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:25,890
the end of the day if you're living here

446
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:27,300
and you're trying to do your best and

447
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:29,670
fulfill your goals that's the American

448
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:31,920
dream so I would say that when it comes

449
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:36,720
to feeling Chinese I feel this innate

450
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:39,090
like belonging to China and does innate

451
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,560
belonging to being Chinese because I am

452
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:41,760
Chinese so it's literally in my blood

453
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,550
like there's nothing that will ever

454
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:47,370
change the fact that I was born in China

455
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:49,200
my my genetics are Chinese and it's just

456
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:51,690
like it feels so strong that it's like

457
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,940
that will always be this huge chunk of

458
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:55,380
my life despite everything else I do

459
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:58,470
that may be different from traditional

460
00:16:55,380 --> 00:17:00,450
Chinese culture or traditional Chinese

461
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:02,250
stuff or even modern Chinese stuff you

462
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:03,750
know like I just always feel like no

463
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:05,939
matter what I'll always have that little

464
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:09,920
piece of my heart of China's yeah I do

465
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:09,920
identify with being chinese-american

466
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:15,360
your favorite thing about being

467
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:16,890
asian-american / your heritage so when

468
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,200
it comes to being American my favorite

469
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:21,660
thing about being American I guess is

470
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:23,520
that America is really good in a sense

471
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:25,560
of you get a lot of chances to be

472
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,780
creative and you get a lot of chances to

473
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:30,480
try new things meet new people and just

474
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:33,150
get so many different perspectives

475
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,830
because the like America has so many

476
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:36,750
different people in it and I think

477
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:39,120
that's my absolute hands-down favorite

478
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:41,730
another big favorite of mine is just the

479
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,080
general like ability you have to kind of

480
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:45,030
write your own story it's my favorite

481
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:47,070
thing about being American when it comes

482
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:48,840
to being Chinese of course the food of

483
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:50,460
course there's like I love Chinese

484
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:53,460
culture because there's this overarching

485
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:55,200
like need and want to always do better

486
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:57,540
and always be the best and I know

487
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,130
sometimes that can be negative but to me

488
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:01,080
it's always positive because I

489
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:02,570
constantly want to better myself I

490
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,130
constantly want to be someone who

491
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:07,020
increases my growth and I just think

492
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:08,520
that's so important and you know what

493
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,840
else has been funny about being Chinese

494
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,120
is that even though I was raised

495
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,490
American by American parents I feel like

496
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:17,100
I have a lot of Chinese like traits and

497
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:18,450
I wonder if its genetic I did read once

498
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,940
that there are certain traits that can

499
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:23,040
be genetic and for instance I save a lot

500
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:24,960
of my money and I don't like spending a

501
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:27,660
lot of my money and on top of that I

502
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,070
think about my future a lot that's more

503
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,720
of a Chinese way to think is thinking

504
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:33,150
about you know the future generations

505
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,610
and future wealth and finally I do try

506
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:38,070
to overachieve I do always try to better

507
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:39,720
like do things better and I want to be

508
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:41,220
the best like I'm very competitive when

509
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,560
it comes to certain stuff like that as

510
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:47,790
much as I don't want to admit it so I do

511
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:50,010
think that I appreciate both American

512
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:51,960
and Chinese values and I like the fact

513
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:53,940
that I'm chinese-american because I can

514
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,770
kind of pick and choose between positive

515
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,750
and negatives from both sides and I

516
00:18:55,770 --> 00:19:01,020
think that's a really big blessing so

517
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:02,760
yes I do love being chinese-american

518
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,560
