1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,440
hey guys it's Karen I've been making

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:07,170
videos for quite a while now so I

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,570
thought I'd let you guys know some facts

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:12,090
about me let's start with some basic

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:14,160
facts as I said before my name is Karen

6
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:17,279
and it's actually spelled with an i

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,920
I am chinese-american and I was born and

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,560
raised in San Francisco my parents are

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,779
from China and if you're curious because

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,000
Chinese people love talking about where

11
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:30,689
they're from my parents are from

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,450
Guangzhou which is southern China so I

13
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:36,210
do speak Cantonese and my Cantonese is

14
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:39,120
actually pretty bad and I don't read any

15
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:42,899
Chinese I was in Chinese school for a

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:45,329
long time and I'm sorry mom and dad I

17
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:47,430
wasted all your money I was born and

18
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:49,469
raised in San Francisco and the only

19
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:52,350
other place I've lived in was Los

20
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:54,449
Angeles for school I mentioned earlier

21
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,370
that I took Chinese classes and I just

22
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:58,469
was a really bad student and didn't

23
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,870
retain anything there's a lot of

24
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:04,080
motorcycles outside so just to show you

25
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:06,750
how bad I am at languages but how much I

26
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,990
am in denial about how bad I am at

27
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:12,479
languages let me tell you about how many

28
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:15,119
languages I've studied so English is my

29
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,920
first language Cantonese is the next one

30
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,890
Mandarin because I went to Chinese

31
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:24,180
school Japanese I took in high school

32
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:26,880
for two years I think I pretty much only

33
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:29,610
cared about food for art history major

34
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,610
in my university you had to take five

35
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:35,189
quarters of language to fulfill your

36
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:39,210
major requirement I could have taken a

37
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:41,430
test on Japanese or Chinese but I was so

38
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:44,040
bad at both of them that there was no

39
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:49,049
way that I could pass a test so I took

40
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:51,780
two quarters of Italian and I was so bad

41
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:52,940
at Italian I was like saying random

42
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,610
Spanish

43
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:58,010
instead of Italian and I don't know why

44
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:59,750
because I never took Spanish I can't

45
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:02,720
take the next quarter of Italian because

46
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:04,370
I just my base was so bad right so I was

47
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,610
like okay go back to the drawing board

48
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:11,060
let's try a new language because that's

49
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:14,570
how my brain works so me being overly

50
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:17,720
confident about everything I do

51
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:21,850
I took an accelerated summer course on

52
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:25,990
French language 12 weeks of classes and

53
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:29,210
it's Monday to Friday 8 a.m. to noon and

54
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:33,410
you just learn French and this is

55
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:38,120
supposed to cover 3/4 which is a year's

56
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:41,450
worth of French in those 10 to 12 weeks

57
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,960
which is insane it was the worst idea

58
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:47,420
ever

59
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:49,820
I was lost by the first week it was it

60
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:52,160
was really rough you guys so that's the

61
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:55,610
story of how I learned 1 2 3 4 5

62
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:59,660
languages and I'm absolutely garbage in

63
00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:00,590
most of them I really love traveling and

64
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:03,320
eating

65
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:05,900
hence the theme of my channel it's all

66
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:10,400
just travel and food and traveling for

67
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:12,260
food and I wish you could eat food to

68
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,450
travel but that doesn't work that way I

69
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:17,209
haven't actually been to a ton of places

70
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:19,670
when we were young we would do mostly

71
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:22,910
road trips because that's an affordable

72
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:25,610
way of vacationing and in California

73
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:27,769
it's great it's a very American thing to

74
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:30,680
do like leaving the country I've only

75
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:33,950
been to Canada in China when I was

76
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:36,140
little and when I grew up I began

77
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:38,660
traveling a little bit more so it

78
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:40,850
started when I went to study abroad in

79
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:44,810
France which I actually ended up doing

80
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:49,130
twice and I also have since visited

81
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:52,340
Japan and I really want to just keep

82
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:56,180
going all over the place it's my dream

83
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:58,730
is to see all of the major museums in

84
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:01,700
the world if you guys follow me on

85
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:03,590
little art talks which is an educational

86
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:07,190
YouTube channel on art in art history

87
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:09,080
that I run I am obsessed with art a lot

88
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:11,030
of people ask me how I afford to travel

89
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:13,670
so much and the funny thing is I'm

90
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:17,479
actually not travelling most of the time

91
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:21,289
I do have a lot of vlog footage that is

92
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:23,510
edited and posted after the fact so when

93
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:26,060
I'm done traveling I'll come back and

94
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:27,590
slowly edit a lot of video I saw a lot

95
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:30,140
of footage from Japan that I never

96
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:34,039
edited when I'm not traveling I do have

97
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:36,110
a not a regular job I do have a job I

98
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:38,450
co-founded a company with my sister

99
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:41,960
called Arden Cove where we make bags and

100
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:43,940
backpacks and our newest bag is a travel

101
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,729
bag because of what I do on this channel

102
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:49,280
it's kind of perfect its anti-theft and

103
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:51,530
waterproof and it's going to be launched

104
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,110
on any gogo in October so I've been

105
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:56,590
super busy preparing for that if you

106
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:59,120
want to check it out however to arden

107
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:02,180

IndieGoGo is up I'm definitely the type

110
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:11,810
of person who has a few but very good

111
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:12,950
close friends I'm not a very outgoing I

112
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:16,010
hmm

113
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:18,740
I am kind of outgoing but not super

114
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:21,950
outgoing and I'm definitely an introvert

115
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:26,419
my myers-briggs personality type is int

116
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:31,280
P which apparently in Star Wars

117
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:34,370
Myer Briggs it's Yoda cuz yeah I really

118
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,440
love I have like a lot of different

119
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:38,479
notebooks and they're each for like a

120
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,550
different thing so I have one for this

121
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:43,789
vlog channel I have one for a little art

122
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:45,650
talks I have one for art and Cove I got

123
00:05:43,789 --> 00:05:48,050
like my only camera when I

124
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:50,479
in elementary school too and it was just

125
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:53,389
like a regular point-and-shoot and back

126
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:56,240
then it was a film camera I would like

127
00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:59,419
get my mom to buy rolls of film so that

128
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:03,139
I could use my look dinky little pointed

129
00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:05,509
shoe but I would always use it indoors

130
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:08,360
instead of like outside and I wouldn't

131
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:10,940
use flash when I needed to use flash so

132
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:13,400
I just had tons and tons of pictures of

133
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:15,590
like just blackness I think at some

134
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,850
point my mom just refused to buy me more

135
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:19,070
film because she was like you're just

136
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:20,690
wasting all this money everything

137
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:23,750
changed when I got my first digital

138
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:26,090
camera which was in high school so I got

139
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,919
my own camera that I got to like carry

140
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:30,110
around I would bring it to school I

141
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,210
would carry it everywhere with me it

142
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:34,160
probably wasn't a good idea because I

143
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:37,660
couldn't have been robbed I've always

144
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:41,360
been a pretty like tech savvy person

145
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:45,560
even when I was a kid I learned you know

146
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:48,410
HTML and my own because I thought it was

147
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,810
cool to like decorate like stupid little

148
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:53,599
websites I did all sorts of weird things

149
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:55,760
I really like listening to music even

150
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:58,490
though I don't know a ton about music

151
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,590
I'll list some artists that I like and

152
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:02,539
if you guys know what they are you can

153
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:04,550
give me some recommendations of music

154
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:06,530
and that would be really fun you know

155
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:08,389
when you're a kid and they always asked

156
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,949
you what do you want to be when you grow

157
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:12,949
up and you have to like fill out some

158
00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:15,650
paper and tell people when I grow up I

159
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:17,870
wanna be blah blah I would always say I

160
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:20,330
wanted to be a teacher I thought I would

161
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:23,810
grow up and be like my mom who was a

162
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:25,699
payroll accountant and that would have

163
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,800
been a really bad idea because I'm so

164
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:30,740
bad with numbers I always say teacher

165
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:33,680
because I liked teachers and I liked the

166
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:36,110
idea of being a veterinarian because I

167
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,690
liked dogs and cats but I always say

168
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:41,570
teacher because I knew how to spell

169
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:44,510
teacher which was way easier to spelled

170
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:46,190
in veterinarian my worst subjects in

171
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:49,330
school were spell

172
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:51,620
and arithmetic I'm very good at like

173
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:55,340
understanding concepts and applying

174
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:58,250
concepts but memorizing things are

175
00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:01,220
really hard for me especially numbers so

176
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:03,830
fun fact I never memorized the

177
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:05,750
multiplication table like my parents

178
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:07,430
made my sister memorize the

179
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:10,970
multiplication table like they would

180
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:12,860
quiz her like with many things they got

181
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:15,080
to me and they're like I already did it

182
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:17,600
once with your older sister she figured

183
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:20,060
it out you'll be fine and I took a lot

184
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:23,000
of math classes like I wasn't bad at

185
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:25,430
math like in terms of grades which is

186
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,100
the craziest thing my favorite class in

187
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:30,740
high school was probably biology another

188
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:33,610
funny story about me as a kid is that as

189
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:36,680
someone who is very passionate about

190
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:38,900
education like I run an educational

191
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:41,930
youtube channel I was not a good student

192
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:45,500
for most of my life like probably not

193
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:49,520
until high school and that is a lot

194
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:51,590
because I daydreamed a ton in elementary

195
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,870
and middle school I just could not pay

196
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:56,390
attention at all I would just be like

197
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:58,760
off in my own little bubble I would

198
00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:01,100
forget like homework assignments I would

199
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,900
just like not even know they existed

200
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:05,090
because I was daydreaming when the

201
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:06,490
teacher was talking about it I've never

202
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:10,010
broken any bones

203
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:11,870
knock on wood but I have twisted my

204
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:14,510
ankle twice and I'm pretty sure it's

205
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:17,030
been the same ankle I suffer from

206
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:19,580
migraine and I actually get ocular

207
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:21,650
migraines as well which basically it's

208
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:24,560
like when you get little white spots

209
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:26,720
like halos in your vision and some

210
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,670
people only get one or the other but I

211
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,740
get both which is really fun I'm

212
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:32,690
definitely a morning person the one

213
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:35,300
thing I need to wear every day is

214
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:37,940
sunscreen I studied abroad twice both

215
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:41,240
times in France but in different parts

216
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:42,920
of France so the first program was in LA

217
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,920
Nepal which is this

218
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:48,860
in Krita France by the French Riviera it

219
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,380
was beautiful by the beach we lived in a

220
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:53,839
freaking castle and then part of the

221
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:56,329
program was in parents and then I did

222
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,190
another program that was in sort of the

223
00:09:56,329 --> 00:10:01,430
middle of nowhere a countryside of

224
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:04,250
France and I just painted and drew all

225
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:06,560
day every day that summer everything we

226
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:09,850
made we made about four hundred and

227
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:13,160
fifty things I think someone counted and

228
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:15,320
we picked out like a handful of our

229
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:19,779
favorites shipped them back to America

230
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:21,019
and burned the rest of them in a bonfire

231
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:23,750
yep

232
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:27,290
it was amazing a lot of times in my

233
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:30,980
videos I'm quite positive and happy and

234
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:33,050
smiley but I'm actually quite not not

235
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:35,750
really a cynical person but I'm quite a

236
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:39,350
sarcastic in in real life with my

237
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:41,389
friends so a lot of times I'll say kind

238
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:43,490
of harsh things knowing that they're

239
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:46,160
kind of harsh and I play off of that and

240
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:48,529
it's just my sense of humor so let's

241
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,720
talk about college for a while first of

242
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:53,269
all I'm 25 years old so I'm a couple

243
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,269
years out of college already I went to

244
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:58,250
UCLA I was a double major in fine arts

245
00:10:56,269 --> 00:11:00,290
in art history I don't have a driver's

246
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:02,899
license which is actually kind of a

247
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:05,089
stereotypical San Francisco thing I have

248
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:09,140
taken the written test actually twice

249
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:11,570
now and I just haven't taken the test to

250
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:17,240
actually get my license maybe it will

251
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:19,220
happen this year I actually never

252
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,320
learned how to ride a bike either and

253
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,300
that's just another thing that my

254
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,250
parents taught my sister I never taught

255
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:27,649
me I only have one sister by the way

256
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:29,779
she's three years older if you've seen

257
00:11:27,649 --> 00:11:32,750
my other videos you've seen her in my

258
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:34,290
videos and she is one of my best friends

259
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:37,199
she's amazing

260
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:40,560
I work with her obviously but I really

261
00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:44,579
respect her and you know all throughout

262
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:48,959
life I actually owe a lot to my sister

263
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:51,690
because she is so smart and driven and

264
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:55,620
dedicated and giving and everything like

265
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:59,009
that um she has taken care of me a lot

266
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:01,170
when I was younger and even now I said

267
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:03,750
before I wasn't a really good student

268
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:07,170
until high school a lot of the reason

269
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:10,800
why I became a better student is because

270
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:13,170
of my sister my sister was a very good

271
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:16,170
student she was like straight A's

272
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:20,550
everything so when I reached high school

273
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:23,910
my goal in high school was to just be

274
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:26,940
the same if not better but like

275
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:30,120
especially just the same as my sister

276
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:33,720
and because I was just determined to

277
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:37,680
like be like not worse than my sister I

278
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:40,500
ended up having good grades and ended up

279
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,329
doing like pretty well in school and

280
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:46,649
going to a good school and stuff like

281
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:48,930
that so it's all because of you Carmen

282
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:51,990
can one of my facts be that I'm an

283
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:54,329
auntie because I kind of love being an

284
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:56,010
auntie when I was younger I was like I

285
00:12:54,329 --> 00:12:57,750
don't know if I really like kids like

286
00:12:56,010 --> 00:13:00,149
I've tutored kids a lot when I was

287
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:02,579
younger my experiences have always been

288
00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:04,980
kind of mediocre which is why I'm like

289
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:07,860
not a teacher I would not be a good

290
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:10,589
teacher but since I've become abouty

291
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:11,279
like I was like oh yeah this kids not

292
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:12,870
too bad

293
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,000
it's just kind of hilarious being at

294
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:16,860
Auntie and like the best part is that I

295
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,329
can like just play with her as much as I

296
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,189
want you and then when she starts

297
00:13:18,329 --> 00:13:20,730
getting Stassi I give her back to her

298
00:13:20,189 --> 00:13:23,610
mom

299
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:26,699
I'm really freaking like just love

300
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:28,949
eating which if you can't tell from this

301
00:13:26,699 --> 00:13:32,339
channel I just really freaking love to

302
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:34,410
eat like everything I'm not a very picky

303
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:36,750
eater there's only a few things I don't

304
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:39,509
really prefer but even if I don't prefer

305
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:42,110
them I would still eat them if I'm with

306
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:44,510
someone who is not a very adventurous

307
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:46,370
Peter I am that annoying person who will

308
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:48,560
be like you should try this you should

309
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:50,600
try this yep like this is this is so

310
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,940
crazy like you should try this part of

311
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:55,610
us because I want to share things I like

312
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:58,100
and like give them this new experience I

313
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:59,870
think is really exciting and part of it

314
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:02,540
is because I'm like making fun of them

315
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:04,910
for like having very arbitrary things

316
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:07,220
they don't like but if I like something

317
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:10,100
like I want to share things I love with

318
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:12,320
people I care about so it comes from a

319
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:14,810
place of love okay if I could only eat

320
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:18,640
one food for the rest of my life for all

321
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:21,740
of my meals it would be sushi and

322
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:26,829
viewers of my other videos now I say

323
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:29,899
sushi a lot instead of sushi or sushi

324
00:14:26,829 --> 00:14:32,390
I'm working on that I've thought about

325
00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:34,130
this because sushi you can eat for

326
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:37,160
breakfast lunch and dinner and it's not

327
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:41,810
super savory or super sweet sushi is

328
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:44,060
always just good you know I love that

329
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:47,540
you guys love sheshe too like my most

330
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:49,160
popular videos are my sushi videos and I

331
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:51,890
love that you guys love it because

332
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:54,260
honestly like now I can just have an

333
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:56,600
excuse to eat sushi all the time and

334
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:58,760
like video tape at all I'll be like this

335
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,740
is for people like people who want to

336
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:02,240
see this

337
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:04,850
my ultimate cheater answer for that

338
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,699
though would be like noodles soup and

339
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:09,380
just like be very general so that I

340
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:11,180
could eat all the noodle soups like I

341
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:14,029
can eat chicken noodle soup but also

342
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:17,420
like thaw and all the Chinese noodle

343
00:15:14,029 --> 00:15:20,630
suits like 110 noodle soup and all the

344
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:23,180
Korean jumped like all of them if I were

345
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:25,339
to break up this question this is so me

346
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:27,800
I'm going to use all my facts on food if

347
00:15:25,339 --> 00:15:29,089
you can only eat one breakfast one lunch

348
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,099
and one dinner

349
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:32,599
and one dessert what would you pick

350
00:15:31,099 --> 00:15:35,389
lunch and dinner I don't really know

351
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:38,239
what the difference would be so maybe

352
00:15:35,389 --> 00:15:42,079
that should just be sushi but breakfast

353
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:44,839
I could eat like avocado toast maybe

354
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:49,219
with some other things on top every day

355
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:51,259
I love avocado so much moly is so good I

356
00:15:49,219 --> 00:15:53,959
really like ice cream but I can't eat it

357
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:57,169
a ton I am slightly lactose intolerant

358
00:15:53,959 --> 00:16:00,139
so I try not to eat too much dairy but

359
00:15:57,169 --> 00:16:02,199
you know ice cream is worth it I really

360
00:16:00,139 --> 00:16:04,819
love macaroons

361
00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:07,729
whatever however you say those things I

362
00:16:04,819 --> 00:16:09,889
mean you like French pastry is so good I

363
00:16:07,729 --> 00:16:12,939
