00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920
hey guys it's Karen's I've done a couple

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:07,080
videos about traveling now and a lot of

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,750
them have to do with safety I've talked

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,540
about common ways that leaves steal from

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,940
purses and also tips on how to stay safe

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,220
when traveling alone safety is

7
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,830
definitely one of the things on the top

8
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,439
of my mind when traveling and obviously

9
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:25,019
because I've also made a whole purse

10
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,300
dedicated to safety these are the

11
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:29,550
anti-theft waterproof crossbodies that

12
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,320
I've designed for Arden Cove and they're

13
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,809
launching on IndieGoGo if you're

14
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,670
interested in checking it out safety is

15
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:38,760
definitely at the top of my priority

16
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:41,340
list when traveling or even at home

17
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,040
living in a city but of course you

18
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,489
should have a ton of fun too so here are

19
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:49,739
my top tips of how to have a successful

20
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:52,020
solo trip my first tip is to have a copy

21
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:54,390
of your passport and very important

22
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,399
information you should have one copy for

23
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,440
your purse and then one copy for your

24
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,270
suitcase in case you lose your purse

25
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,219
hopefully you watch my video of how to

26
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:05,189
protect your purse so that you don't run

27
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:07,799
into a situation but just in case number

28
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:10,530
two is pretty obvious do what you want

29
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,570
to do you don't have a friend or family

30
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,490
member to accommodate to you don't have

31
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:17,369
to consider what they like or their

32
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:20,130
feelings about certain things so if you

33
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:22,110
are a huge space nerd you can go to the

34
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,060
planetarium and spend the whole day

35
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,430
there if you wanted to take this time to

36
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:30,000
do whatever you want to do and if that

37
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:32,189
means sleeping in until 11am hey guess

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,729
what you can because it's your vacation

39
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:38,130
you do you number three it's okay to not

40
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:39,900
do everything I know you're spending a

41
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:42,060
lot of money and you want to get the

42
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,250
most out of this trip but it's

43
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,560
impossible to do every single little

44
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,750
thing and if you end up over packing

45
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,850
your schedule you might end up not

46
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,340
enjoying your trip as much and so

47
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,590
instead I would suggest to prioritize

48
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,020
what you want to do don't overschedule

49
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,360
things if you end up having some extra

50
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,880
time you can do the next thing on the

51
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,759
list or you can just play it by ear and

52
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,099
wander around number four walk as much

53
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,899
as possible it's the best way to explore

54
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:11,819
the city and you'll bump into things

55
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:12,720
that you wouldn't have bumped into

56
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,610
otherwise

57
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,370
and you might find some really cool

58
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:19,740
stuff of course public transit is also

59
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:22,350
great when it's too far to walk number

60
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:24,240
five pack light if you see my packing

61
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:26,850
videos you know that i carry only one

62
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,710
back one possible i'll do carry on only

63
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:30,870
and it's great i don't have to check in

64
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,120
my bag I know I can carry everything

65
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:35,610
myself and toss it into the overhead bin

66
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,220
myself and it's also easy to navigate

67
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:41,040
the streets when I arrived so that I'm

68
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:43,560
not lugging my luggage around trying to

69
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,330
navigate the streets to the hotel during

70
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,330
the day I love traveling with cross

71
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:50,850
bodies especially our own obviously it's

72
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:52,890
great because it's hands-free and it has

73
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:55,140
security features and it's waterproof

74
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:57,270
it's ideal for traveling and really

75
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:59,790
comfortable so you don't carry too much

76
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:01,410
around the full size is great for days

77
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:04,290
when I'm going to be spending a lot of

78
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:06,750
time on trains so I can carry a kindle

79
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:08,340
with me a little novel or a journal the

80
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,440
mini is great when I'm on the move all

81
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,810
did because it's so small it's going to

82
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,850
not be in my way but it's big enough to

83
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:17,610
carry all of my essentials my sunglasses

84
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:20,070
my camera my portable charger my cell

85
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:22,830
phone and then obviously cards and keys

86
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:25,380
and that's all I need and it's perfect

87
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:27,780
number six is one how to be a smart

88
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:30,000
traveler as I said before I have a

89
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,950
couple videos on this and i highly

90
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,290
recommend that you check them out even

91
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:37,110
if it's not my own videos check out some

92
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:39,840
other videos or articles online so that

93
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:42,810
you're educated informed I don't want

94
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,420
you to be scared don't be afraid of solo

95
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:48,060
travel but definitely be educated stay

96
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:51,150
informed number seven is to meet new

97
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:53,130
people i know i just said to be safe and

98
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:55,230
everything like that being safe doesn't

99
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:57,360
mean being afraid of people you should

100
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:59,400
be afraid of certain people but not

101
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,110
afraid of everyone but if you're smart

102
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,900
about it meeting new people can be

103
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:06,000
perfectly safe and often very rewarding

104
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,980
if their local you can learn so much

105
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,870
about the place you're staying and they

106
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,820
can give you great recommendations if

107
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:14,280
their fellow travelers you can talk

108
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:16,109
about what you guys are doing and if

109
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,269
there's common interests you can

110
00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:19,830
actually link up and make a group

111
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:21,390
because sometimes there's group

112
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:23,580
discounts for things which is really

113
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:25,920
nice and of course you make new friends

114
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,410
so it's great number eight is Larry

115
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,240
how to enjoy being alone and getting to

116
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:32,130
know yourself I know that sounds a

117
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,720
little bit silly because of course you

118
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:35,880
know yourself but when you're traveling

119
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,560
alone you're spending a lot of time by

120
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,060
yourself you're going to learn pretty

121
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,130
quickly your strengths and your

122
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,200
weaknesses what you're comfortable with

123
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:45,090
and what you're uncomfortable with for

124
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,700
example you might be just fine walking

125
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:49,950
around during the day by yourself but

126
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:52,410
you're actually not as comfortable

127
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:55,110
eating alone at a restaurant by yourself

128
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:57,810
in those cases I challenge you to face

129
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:59,310
those uncomfortable moments for example

130
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:01,470
if you don't like eating alone at a

131
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:03,780
restaurant to try it out and see how you

132
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:06,210
like it maybe after a couple of times

133
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:08,430
you end up really enjoying it you spend

134
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:10,500
more time actually tasting the food or

135
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:12,660
you do more people watching and enjoy

136
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,550
the scenery you might even end up

137
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,410
talking to the person at the table next

138
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:18,000
to you so it can be a really cool

139
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:20,490
experience that you might have not

140
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,840
challenged yourself to do otherwise so

141
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:25,080
the final thing I want to leave you guys

142
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,930
with is remember it's okay if something

143
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:31,050
goes wrong you can only try to deal with

144
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:33,630
a bad situation as best as you can and

145
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:35,910
then move on that being said some

146
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:38,670
unfortunate situations are preventable

147
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:41,070
such as picking a purse that it be will

148
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:43,110
not steal from you or at least make it

149
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:44,910
harder for the thief to steal from you
