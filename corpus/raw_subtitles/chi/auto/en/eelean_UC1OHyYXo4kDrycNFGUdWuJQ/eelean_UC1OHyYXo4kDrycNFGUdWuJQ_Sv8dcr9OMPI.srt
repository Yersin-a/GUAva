00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:10,429
hey guys welcome back to my channel I

3
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:13,469
was scrolling around YouTube and I saw

4
00:00:10,429 --> 00:00:16,260
no it's called like growing up Asian

5
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:18,180
American tag it's basically just like a

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,580
couple questions explaining what it's

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,980
like growing up Asian American I saw it

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,619
and I was like I really want to do this

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,260
so we're gonna do it I have some tea

10
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:30,660
here because I am sick I saw this by Amy

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,349
Lee I think she's the one who created

12
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:38,040
this tag

13
00:00:32,349 --> 00:00:40,890
I am Chinese full Chinese that's it

14
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,110
I'm the first generation I think I was

15
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,170
the first generation born in this

16
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,170
country

17
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:49,940
I moved when I was like around six when

18
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:52,130
I lived in New York City I was just with

19
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:53,810
family all the time obviously I was too

20
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:56,030
young to like have friends and stuff I

21
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:58,760
lived with my extended family as well as

22
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:02,150
my immediate family so everyone was

23
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:04,220
Chinese and that's just who I saw where

24
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:06,860
I was in New York it wasn't really

25
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:08,930
predominately Asian so I knew there was

26
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:11,660
other people in the world then after I

27
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:15,050
moved we moved to a predominantly white

28
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:17,810
area from kindergarten to like third

29
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:19,400
grade that school was like all white

30
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:22,880
people from what I remember there was

31
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,410
probably like ten Asians that I saw it

32
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,420
was a really small school all its

33
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:28,070
teachers were white all the staff or

34
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:31,550
white I would get bullied for being

35
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:33,650
Asian but I don't really blame the kids

36
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:35,660
I guess because they didn't know any

37
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:37,520
better well I'm sure some of them knew

38
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:40,160
better some of them were just I would

39
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,140
get bullied a lot about my eyes and why

40
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,090
I'm Chinese that was probably my first

41
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:46,660
experience of realizing that I was a

42
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:46,660
minority

43
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:54,420
I'm like ashamed of saying this but I

44
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,170
did sort of reject my heritage and my

45
00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:00,390
culture around early teens kind of I

46
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,829
refuse to speak Chinese like in public

47
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,689
because I was like people are gonna look

48
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:04,920
at us and it was true like people did

49
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:06,720
look at us weird when we spoke Chinese

50
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,750
people were just like oh my god like

51
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,890
they're talking about us when like rude

52
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,819
probably talking about what was on the

53
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:14,370
menu or something

54
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:16,500
growing up in a mostly white community

55
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:18,870
where people are racist I did start to

56
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,540
kind of reject my culture and it's not

57
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,980
like I really had the opportunity to be

58
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,540
in touch with my culture there wasn't

59
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,099
really a lot of Asian culture

60
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,470
surrounding me we started speaking

61
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:30,989
English at home and there wasn't really

62
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:33,840
a lot of family around me so I adapted

63
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:36,299
to my surroundings now I am very proud

64
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,530
of where I come from I'm proud to be

65
00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:39,329
Chinese some part of the Asian American

66
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,340
it makes me like Who I am

67
00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:43,650
people can say I'm whitewash but I will

68
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,140
always have this skin I will always be

69
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,420
Chinese I will always be Asian I will

70
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:51,790
always be perceived as an Asian American

71
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:55,569
I'm proud of it

72
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:57,610
I am decent at school I wouldn't say I'm

73
00:02:55,569 --> 00:03:01,060
like super smart because I'm really not

74
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:04,030
super smart I'm like a little bit above

75
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:06,489
average and I think people have always

76
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:08,829
just assumed like oh she's Asian you

77
00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:10,510
know she's just good at everything it

78
00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:12,280
just bothers me because that literally

79
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:14,260
does not like make any sense

80
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,030
I put an effort and the only reason why

81
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,280
I'm a little bit above average as

82
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:20,590
opposed to average is because I put in

83
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,209
so much effort into my work I ask

84
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:24,159
questions if I need help with something

85
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:24,940
I will go get help things don't come

86
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,040
easily to me

87
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:29,889
they have never come easily to me

88
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,290
especially math I am awful at math I'm

89
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:34,659
telling you like awful the only reason I

90
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:36,280
am at the level I am is because I've

91
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:38,829
tried so hard is because I've asked for

92
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,549
help and ask questions it really

93
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:44,709
aggravates me when people are like oh

94
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:46,690
you're just good at school like

95
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:48,129
obviously you're good because she's

96
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:51,159
Asian that's not the case at all because

97
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:54,010
I put as much work and as everyone else

98
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:56,650
does maybe even more just because of

99
00:03:54,010 --> 00:04:00,040
that stereotype on like the flipside I'm

100
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:02,799
also very against all Asian stereotype I

101
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:05,639
am NOT scrawny not saying that Asians

102
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:08,440
are scrawny but like I have a more

103
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:10,780
athletically built body I would say

104
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:14,109
compared to like some other Asians

105
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:16,389
I'm also very tall I am 5 8 so for an

106
00:04:14,109 --> 00:04:19,329
Asian girl like that is it's pretty tall

107
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:21,579
I'm not into math I like writing I'm not

108
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:24,310
good with like drawing or any of that

109
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:28,090
I'm really bad at drawing actually the

110
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:30,760
stereotypical norm for Asians I am sort

111
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:35,080
of the opposite I wouldn't say I'm like

112
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:37,419
a petite little like i'ma just do and

113
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,250
irena i'ma go along with whatever like I

114
00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:41,139
like standing my ground I like knowing

115
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:43,330
what I want I just don't want to reform

116
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:45,729
to that stereotypical Asian girl where

117
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:48,070
when you get a husband you are pushover

118
00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:50,349
and you just do whatever your husband

119
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:53,919
wants like I am a strong independent

120
00:04:50,349 --> 00:04:56,470
woman I think it's kind of growing where

121
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,960
there's more Asians like this and that

122
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:04,419
makes me so happy because why should we

123
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:07,289
be that house what Asian housewife that

124
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:07,289
men push over

125
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:18,819
yes and no my dialect of Chinese is not

126
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:21,879
Mandarin I can basically do the basics

127
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:25,379
of my dialect and also Mandarin I can

128
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:25,379
somewhat understand Kanto

129
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,280
I mean growing up asian-american we have

130
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:33,050
like different struggles that is kind of

131
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,750
harder to relate to especially because

132
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:37,550
they didn't grow up in America or at

133
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:40,460
least my parents didn't so it is harder

134
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:43,810
to have like a mutual understanding of

135
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:43,810
kind of what's going on

136
00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:51,180
I kind of like touched on this earlier

137
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:54,439
on but I love my heritage now I wish I

138
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:56,909
could learn more about my heritage it's

139
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:59,580
hard because I can't really speak to

140
00:05:56,909 --> 00:06:01,520
like my grandparents and I would love to

141
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:04,680
sit down and like have a conversation

142
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,379
with them about like life and how they

143
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,740
emigrated here and just like all that

144
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:09,150
stuff

145
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,039
I love being Chinese I love being

146
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:16,099
asian-american and I wouldn't change it

147
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:16,099
do you identify with it I would say so

148
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:23,679
my favorite thing about being

149
00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:27,699
asian-american is that we have this

150
00:06:23,679 --> 00:06:31,569
chance to create a new identity identity

151
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:33,069
I didn't identity I don't know why that

152
00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:35,829
words sounding so weird to me right now

153
00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:39,039
but we have this chance to create a new

154
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:41,619
identity for how people perceive Asians

155
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:45,069
before they would just be seen as you

156
00:06:41,619 --> 00:06:47,979
know math people who are shy and not

157
00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:50,289
outgoing not athletic and we have the

158
00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:53,139
chance as Asian Americans to prove them

159
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:55,539
wrong to show them that we can do

160
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:57,369
whatever the heck we want we can be

161
00:06:55,539 --> 00:07:00,399
great at math we can be great at English

162
00:06:57,369 --> 00:07:02,919
we can be rocket scientists we can also

163
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:06,509
be artists we can also be photographers

164
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:08,279
we can be chefs we can be

165
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:11,249
we have that ability we have that

166
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:14,340
control to change how Americans perceive

167
00:07:11,249 --> 00:07:16,919
us because we are the living examples

168
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:19,770
also being Asian American I like that I

169
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:23,520
have American culture and I have Asian

170
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:26,279
culture I have school and friends and

171
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:29,150
just living under certain like American

172
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:31,979
style and I can also come home to a

173
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:35,159
traditional Chinese dish I love like

174
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:37,740
that just the whole concept of being

175
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:40,080
able to have both everything about my

176
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:42,689
heritage in general I think that there's

177
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,419
just so much background so much history

178
00:07:42,689 --> 00:07:47,759
so much tradition especially in Chinese

179
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:49,560
culture there's so much tradition there

180
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,900
are so many things that you have to

181
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,689
follow and like sometimes they're a bit

182
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:56,490
like like why but that's probably my

183
00:07:54,689 --> 00:07:58,379
like American side like why do I have to

184
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:01,409
do that why do I have to follow that but

185
