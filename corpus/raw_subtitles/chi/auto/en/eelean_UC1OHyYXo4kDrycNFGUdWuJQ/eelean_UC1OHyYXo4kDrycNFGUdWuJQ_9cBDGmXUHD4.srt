31
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:58,399
it was with a skirt but i did not like

32
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,399
it so i just took the tank top and not

33
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,800
the skirt this is from charlotte russe

34
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,080
and it is an extra small that is why it

35
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,159
is so freaking tight

36
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,840
i was like why is it so small so i don't

37
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,119
really wear it that often but it is a

38
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,040
really cute piece

39
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,960
there's this green lacy detail and then

40
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,000
the back is like this

41
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,439

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,159
this sporty tank top it's this pretty

43
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,119
i don't really know what color this is

49
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,119

53
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,680
is in a size medium i was so excited

54
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,240
when i found this because it like

55
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,560
actually fits me and it's like a cute

56
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,280
crop like it's not fully cropped but it

57
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,840
is

58
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,119
a cute crop i'm pretty sure i got this

59
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,079
for like under

60
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:00,000
ten dollars at goodwill all of like my

61
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,960
actual thrifted things are from goodwill

62
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,399
next i have this jean jacket i just

63
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,600
thought i got everything from goodwill

64
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,759
but i actually got this

65
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,440
from thailand when i was studying abroad

66
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,200
there from this place called

67
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,120
cool monkey it was like right across

68
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,560
from my apartment building it is this

69
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,200
cute little denim

70
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,480
it's like a light wash it's kind of a

71
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,800
stretchy material

72
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,239
it's from the brand global works in a

73
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:27,520
size medium it was 300 baht so it was 10

74
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:30,239
in the u.s next i have my only pair of

75
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,560
actual jeans that i have ever thrifted

76
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,760
so

77
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,200
it is these they look really big because

78
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,760
they are really big

79
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,440
i had to resize them because they

80
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,080
wouldn't fit my waist

81
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,720
so i have like stitching here stitching

82
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,879
in the back

83
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,080
and then stitching here just to cinch it

84
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,280
in at the waist

85
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,920
they're cute little mom jean

86
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,440
type of things i cuffed the bottoms and

87
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,720
i would normally wear this with a belt

88
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,400
because even though i

89
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,319
stitched the sides up it's still a

90
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,959
little big it's a really really good

91
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,040
material

92
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,480
there was a little patch in the back so

93
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,840
i took that off

94
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,040
so i'm guessing this was like the

95
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,760
original color of the denim this is just

96
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,080
what it looks like now thrifting jeans

97
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,040
is

98
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,080
very hard for me because i just don't

99
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,400
like the way

100
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,040
jeans fit and i'm trying to get into

101
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,120
like mom jeans and like bag your jeans

102
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,440
but they just don't look good on me i

103
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,879
see pictures of like

104
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,400
these type of outfits okay and then i

105
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,040
try it on and like

106
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,799
i don't look like that but that is okay

107
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,519
so that is it for my video i hope you

108
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,360
guys enjoyed

109
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,680
please thrift instead of supporting fast

110
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,599
fashion fast fashion is the second

111
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,360
leading cause of pollution in the world

112
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,040
next to the oil industry

113
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,200
also because most items of clothing are

114
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,080
produced in countries such as china

115
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,840
and bangladesh their main type of energy

116
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,519
source is coal which is

117
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,280
the most polluting energy source so

118
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,959
please don't support fast fashion go

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,239
