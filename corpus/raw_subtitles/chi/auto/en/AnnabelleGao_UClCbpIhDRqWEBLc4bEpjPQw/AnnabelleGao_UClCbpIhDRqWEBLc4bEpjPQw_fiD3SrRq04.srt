1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,719
no

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:12,400
no my microphones stand

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:15,040
[Music]

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,640

00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,080
again i can't wait to catch up through

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,720
this q a

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,600
um thank you to everybody who submitted

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,760
questions

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,599
also in the description you can jump to

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,599
specific questions or come back to them

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,679
i think the easiest thing to start off

12
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,200
with many people are excited to

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,360
learn about bambi and prairie how

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,520
they're doing i expected that prairie

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,680
would be very standoffish

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,280
i said give her a week i think it really

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,680
only took her

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,800
four days we were at lillis for the

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,039
first week

20
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,000
when i had to organize my storage unit

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,640
but i don't want to

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,640
explain all of that process to in detail

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,039
because the vlog is coming out next week

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,320
show not tell right good news is after

25
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,160
we settled into

26
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,920
this new york space three days or so

27
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,920
they were already playing

28
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,000
chasing each other grooming each other

29
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,840
and i think like the only step left is

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,840
for them to cuddle i was a little bit

31
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,479
worried whether or not they would feel

32
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,040
disappointed or cabin fever from being

33
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,439
in

34
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,720
this studio apartment bambi's been

35
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,159
living in a two-bedroom

36
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,119
two-story house for a year and even my

37
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,920
sisters are kind of

38
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,280
put up at apartment is bigger it's a

39
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,479
huge downgrade

40
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,119
but i do keep in mind just like what i

41
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,159
feel

42
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,799
would be healthy i almost got

43
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,320
another studio apartment with no view

44
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,920
right off the bat i just had a bad

45
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,640
feeling about that place my sister was

46
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,040
just like this

47
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,400
jeopardizes cat vitality or something

48
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,560
like that maybe i can

49
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,759
take them out on walks again but from

50
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,520
experience

51
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,200
neither of them liked it very much i

52
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,399
don't think that the space is actually

53
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,479
too small for

54
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,759
the three of us here because like

55
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,680
they're two tiny cats

56
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,439
and i make sure that there's plenty of

57
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,840
perching spots for them whether it be

58
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,439
like

59
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,960
all over this couch they have their own

60
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,119
couch they have the castle

61
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,799
the table top and the bed and they love

62
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,399
to switch out their resting spots

63
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,079
and they kind of have like this routine

64
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,160
maybe i'll do a day in the life of

65
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,479
prairie and bambi one day on to me

66
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,200
what am i most excited about living in

67
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,599
new york

68
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,400
explore more of the city of course and

69
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,040
to

70
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,680
make new friends i've been really

71
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,520
anxious

72
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,239
all my life when it comes to making

73
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,879
friends and i have a really

74
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,800
great set of friends how do i say we're

75
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,599
not like in a big group or anything

76
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,959
i have really strong one-on-one bonds

77
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,640
but now that i'm an adult and

78
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,239
self-employed it's just a lot harder to

79
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,480
meet people right one of the reasons why

80
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,040
i wanted to move here is the culture

81
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,440
and the arts scene and like maybe i

82
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,560
could get a studio residency and just be

83
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,160
more hands-on

84
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:49,280
yeah in terms of that living in new york

85
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,879
eating and exploring cool

86
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:55,120
oh you know what clubbing i've never

87
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,239
gone to a club or like even a party

88
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,040
where i'm like

89
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,440
my sister has a lot more expertise than

90
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,480
me

91
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,319
so luckily she doesn't live far just a

92
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,680
train ride she's gonna come over

93
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,480
and in the uh occasional nights where i

94
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,200
don't sleep

95
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,480
before 10. so i have to figure out how

96
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,159
i'm going to

97
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,599
did i always know i was gonna come to

98
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,519
new york no

99
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,840
there were maybe two or three times i

100
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,760
was like hoping i can come to new york

101
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:25,040
and even making plans or looking at

102
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:28,000
apartments but it never even solidified

103
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,000
in the back of my mind i just sort of if

104
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,879
this dream was a balloon i just kind of

105
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,200
let it go and

106
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,640
watched it flow far away in the sky i

107
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,720
was like it's okay

108
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,159
it doesn't have to be my life i'm proud

109
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,480
of myself for being here

110
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,319
i'm never bored when i was reading the

111
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,840
book flow they were kind of saying

112
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,920
you don't want to be in a state of

113
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,640
either boredom or anxiety you want to

114
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,360
find

115
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,319
flow i'm always on the anxiety side but

116
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,879
occasionally

117
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,360
i do find that nice flow and i enjoy my

118
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,319
day

119
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,480
when i plan it out nicely do i miss home

120
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,879
i've not been here long enough to feel

121
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,159
homesick i really enjoy the independence

122
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,640
i'm sure as time goes

123
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,560
on i will begin to miss my family but

124
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,640
now that i'm not in school

125
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,159
i okay i've been having extreme brain

126
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,120
farts i don't know what happened here i

127
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,360
meant to say

128
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,280
now that i'm out of school my schedule

129
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:21,440
doesn't have to work around going home

130
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,440
only on holiday breaks which is nice

131
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,199
do i miss home it definitely gets quiet

132
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,120
sometimes at night

133
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,960
i kind of just get myself in a mood to

134
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,000
really enjoy the evening

135
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,120
and like take it slow and stuff i can

136
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,720
make videos about this

137
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,960
if you're interested in terms of just

138
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,240
being homesick in general i moved around

139
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,880
so much growing up

140
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,400
i never feel attached to any one place i

141
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,120
used to be a lot more attached to

142
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,479
objects

143
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,840
which have has changed recently but like

144
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,759
i think what i have the hardest time

145
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:53,680
letting go of are like memories

146
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,160
of a time where things were once like

147
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,320
this

148
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,160
and they would never be like that again

149
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,280
my yeah yeah which is

150
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,759
my wait what paternal

151
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,840
grandfather and i had a really close

152
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,919
relationship and he's

153
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,120
he passed away from cancer a long time

154
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,880
ago i had

155
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:16,000
some of the most happiest memories um

156
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,160
of my life so i still

157
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,479
ruminate on a lot of those memories it's

158
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:24,160
like equal parts

159
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:25,919
sorrow and joy so here in new york do i

160
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,520
feel free or released

161
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,240
the main difference is being able to do

162
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,560
things

163
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,160
by my own schedule cooking my own meals

164
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,120
right like my grandma's not there to

165
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,039
take care of me

166
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,560
but at the same time i won't feel the

167
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,960
pressure and the guilt

168
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,639
to say like i need to eat dinner an hour

169
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,759
later like organize my time

170
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,720
without needing to explain myself has

171
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,120
definitely saved

172
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,160
some mental energy but at the same time

173
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,560
it was never

174
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,600
too bad because living in my family

175
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,160
house

176
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,319
it was really comfortable the only huge

177
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,479
difference is like the first time

178
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,639
i went grocery shopping i was just like

179
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,400
what the [ __ ] living at home for a year

180
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,520
has like screwed me over

181
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,960
because i completely forgot my meal plan

182
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,800
it's been a long time since i've shopped

183
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,720
for myself i definitely don't think i'm

184
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,039
gonna stay in new york forever

185
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,960
the way i eventually want to live my

186
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:20,000
life maybe have like a little store

187
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:22,240
or a cafe and have like a nice

188
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,360
quiet home with my family and i can't

189
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,000
afford anywhere

190
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,400
like near new york city i just don't

191
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,639
think

192
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,680
that's realistic here the worst parts of

193
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,960
living alone

194
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,680
having to face the crises all by

195
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,720
yourself

196
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,960
at school you know those nights where

197
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,960
the cats would catch this mouse maybe

198
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,720
one was missing its head or whatever you

199
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,280
know you have to pick it up yourself

200
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,600
so i've been paying for my own bills

201
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,800
since i moved out of my college dorm the

202
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,680
only main things

203
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,199
i rely on my mom for is phone like we're

204
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,599
still on a family

205
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,039
phone plan other responsibilities that

206
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,120
i'm going to look into

207
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,479
that i haven't previously done is like

208
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,800
renters insurance

209
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,919
cat health insurance we don't have

210
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,120
dental insurance

211
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,759
so i'm going to have to go like i have a

212
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,160
cavity

213
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,759
uh poopy parts of being an adult of

214
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,680
course but inevitable

215
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,840
probably gonna have to spend 300 on that

216
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,440
cavity lilith doesn't live so far from

217
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,880
me she's in rhode island still

218
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,720
and she's gonna take the train in next

219
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,400
week and i'm gonna see her so i'm

220
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,759
excited it kind of reminds me of the

221
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,520
gilmore girls

222
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:31,039
uh intro song all you have to do is

223
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:35,599
call my name and i'll be there

224
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:39,680
on the next train where you lead

225
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:43,039
i will follow anywhere

226
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,840
that you tell me to i can go and visit

227
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,720
hair and a train

228
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,759
anytime so in terms of my current job

229
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,759
uncertainty

230
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,280
what the hell i'm doing how many jobs am

231
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,199
i juggling so the

232
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,599
main thing i'm doing is youtube

233
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,000
full-time and my shop i would say i

234
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,479
spend

235
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,840
equal energy on both of those and then i

236
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,160
run my patreon

237
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,599
i have like a little bit over 400

238
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,039
amazing patrons

239
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,639
that have stuck with me even though i've

240
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,120
been the most unproductive

241
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,759
ass in the last three months in the

242
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,160
beginning

243
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,520
i was like overworking myself i don't

244
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,039
know like just needing to prove

245
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,280
something to myself i think

246
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,319
do i fear the uncertainty of this

247
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,000
self-employment

248
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:25,360
yes yes every

249
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,280
day every waking moment

250
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,479
you know i haven't been as active on

251
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,919
youtube

252
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,440
i appreciate when people say they miss

253
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,560
me on youtube because i'm just like it

254
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,039
makes me realize

255
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,120
that i used to be a lot more productive

256
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,440
so as soon as i cover all my bases

257
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,240
like make a nice spreadsheet of my

258
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,399
financials

259
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,440
i want to make enough for savings then

260
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,880
we can talk about

261
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,360
um like what do you call it like

262
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,440
expendable income it's worth it for me

263
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,519
yes i can be saving like thousands of

264
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,000
dollars by living at home

265
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,440
but like not only is being in the

266
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,240
suburbs just

267
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,320
too it's like drying me out full on

268
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,800
spongebob in the spongebob movie

269
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,839
bird needs to leave the nest as one of

270
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,640
my friends

271
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,320
put it and a viewer asked me a sort of

272
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,399
personal question about

273
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,160
if they should go into engineering

274
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,240
because it ensures

275
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,279
their livelihood in the future because

276
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,760
if they instead major in their passion

277
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,920
which is literature like maybe they

278
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,640
would be unemployed and struggling i

279
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,399
guess my advice would be ask yourself

280
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,320
could you imagine yourself being happy

281
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,200
doing engineering if you had to

282
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,480
go into work five days a week probably

283
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,959
four decades

284
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,320
doing this field could you actually be

285
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,040
happy with it because if you're pretty

286
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,680
content

287
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,959
and you can get a stable livelihood then

288
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,720
you can definitely take

289
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,240
classes or go back to school for your

290
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,399
passion but

291
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,440
if you just if you cannot like go on

292
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,560
living like that

293
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:53,040
which is kind of how i feel about why

294
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,839
i needed to pursue art full-time even if

295
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,320
it means like

296
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,320
a life of uncertainty like to me that

297
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,440
rigor is really worth it but also if you

298
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,600
want to get a degree

299
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,279
in literature and you feel like you

300
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,160
might not immediately find a job

301
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,959
related to your field that's so normal

302
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,600
even people

303
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,959
who graduate with stem backgrounds might

304
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,120
end up somewhere not even in

305
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,440
remotely related to their actual major

306
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,959
if i were to get a stem job well

307
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,560
i am very passionate about biology i've

308
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,160
always enjoyed biology

309
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,079
i used to think i would be great as a

310
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,399
nurse i realize i'm kind of faint when

311
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:29,680
it comes to thinking about like surgery

312
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,720
or like injuries so i actually don't

313
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,959
think i would be great

314
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,920
dream job okay would be some sort of

315
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,079
biologist

316
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,440
and i get to go in the field to research

317
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,079
marine biology

318
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,680
or just ecosystems in general i've seen

319
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:45,680
organizations that

320
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:47,600
do rescue and animal rehabilitation or

321
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,079
is that like a veterinarian

322
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,040
field or a mix of both some of you might

323
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:54,000
know that toby

324
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,519
ran away last month and that was really

325
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,240
unexpected and

326
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,680
totally messed up my shop or operations

327
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,160
because i kind of just shut down for a

328
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,519
few

329
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,360
months for a few days and during those

330
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,279
days one of the things i did was watch

331
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,640
our planet on netflix

332
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,720
and i've always loved animal

333
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,440
documentaries and i really liked that

334
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,640
one too

335
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,480
i just never got the chance there were

336
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,279
some scary parts like seeing

337
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,120
an unbalanced ecosystem way too many of

338
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,320
like this one species and how that

339
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,160
affects other species

340
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:25,600
it was just super insightful and quite

341
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,600
inspiring at the end

342
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,399
okay so how am i really

343
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,079
i thought i would be a lot more concise

344
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:37,680
when answering this question but

345
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:40,480
in general i'm doing uh like

346
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,279
i'm i just realized how much work i have

347
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,560
to do on myself and it's cool my mental

348
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:48,079
health has been

349
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:50,399
so bad for so long i didn't even notice

350
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,399
when you're not really thinking about it

351
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,519
and you have coping mechanisms that like

352
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,279
act as crutches for you to be able to be

353
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,880
high functioning at the things that you

354
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,959
need to get by with

355
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,360
there's no more pretending admitting to

356
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,000
myself hey i actually don't feel okay at

357
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,560
all about this

358
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,040
why do i think that and i'm packing it i

359
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,440
found

360
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,959
pretty cool books that have been helpful

361
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,120
podcasts but

362
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,120
finally i i'm going back to therapy

363
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,800
yesterday i signed up for it i'm trying

364
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,920
a service i haven't done before

365
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,040
so i'm still waiting to get matched to a

366
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,279
specific counselor

367
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,600
and start the session i just hope that

368
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,760
all around my mental state will improve

369
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,600
and that could impact my productivity

370
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,920
how do you really expect anyone to be

371
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,240
thriving with the year that we've had

372
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,360
so i give myself a break in terms of

373
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,040
that but like also

374
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,880
hey how can i make the best with what

375
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,800
i'm given that's sort of

376
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,279
what i'm trying to do right now so i've

377
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,000
been having a long art block for a long

378
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,320
time

379
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,680
and yes i question my abilities am i

380
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,000
doing enough

381
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,200
am i as good as i think or i just

382
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,760
question that all the time

383
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,920
one of the ways to calm down a little

384
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,760
bit is to get off social media when

385
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,399
you're on the explore page sometimes

386
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,800
you find so many inspiring people and

387
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,040
that

388
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,160
fires you up and you want to paint but

389
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,639
other times it

390
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,480
totally over stimulates me and i just

391
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,560
get into this paralyzed like

392
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,600
huh i can't do anything just a few

393
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,959
decades ago

394
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,320
we weren't exposed to so many hundreds

395
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,200
and thousands of different

396
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,880
people living different lives so in our

397
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,519
head we kind of compart

398
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,160
to mentalize all of these internet

399
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,639
strangers

400
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,519
always thinking that other people are

401
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,000
doing

402
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:32,000
and being more productive than us that

403
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,800
they're struggling less thriving way

404
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,480
more than us

405
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,720
and that we're falling behind seeing

406
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,600
like my peers sometimes i love seeing

407
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,760
their illustrations

408
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,160
sometimes it just makes me question

409
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:45,279
myself feel like i'm getting nowhere

410
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,560
i do feel like right now i'm nowhere

411
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:50,079
like as in

412
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:53,120
i don't really know where

413
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:56,240
i want to go my life because

414
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,199
in college i have this huge dream that

415
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,120
was

416
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:01,600
shattered like i became really

417
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:05,120
disillusioned i started school

418
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,839
wanting to do textiles for fashion and i

419
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,160
wanted to do

420
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,680
fashion because i was just one person

421
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,160
and that person just doesn't exist

422
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:15,040
anymore like i'm not that person anymore

423
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,600
so it does make me question like do i

424
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,839
want to

425
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,800
even work for a fashion company because

426
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,800
the person who

427
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,320
wanted to work for a fashion company

428
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,880
thought that her life was going to be

429
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,480
like this

430
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,160
i really want to work on illustration

431
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,880
because see if i didn't do

432
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:31,600
fashion and if i never pursued that

433
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:35,440
career i would want to do

434
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:38,560
storytelling probably animation

435
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,199
or write graphic novels um my muse

436
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,440
currently

437
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,959
they're my cats i'm freaking cat

438
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,079
creature i live with two

439
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:48,079
of the most charming little things and

440
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,920
i've been sketching my cats a lot and

441
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,839
i'm prepared to see a lot of cat

442
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,440
paintings because i'm just like hey

443
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,880
i have an artist blog what do i do i'm

444
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,519

445
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,240
tomorrow

446
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,160
and maybe one day i will expand my

447
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,120
visual vocabulary do i want to continue

448
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,440
doing textiles

449
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,639
yes even if i don't want to do it on

450
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,399
like a corporate level

451
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,160
a freaking textiles is like the most

452
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,880
magical thing ever if you learn the

453
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,880
craft

454
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,880
of textiles whether it be weaving

455
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,680
crocheting knitting

456
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,880
dying i would never regret having

457
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,360
learned

458
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,720
what i have learned and the appreciation

459
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,040
for textiles

460
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,480
i love it i have a knitting machine i

461
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,600
purchased from a friend that i haven't

462
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,480
started using

463
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,880
so expect some knitting struggles from

464
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,160
me

465
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:34,800
sometimes to calm myself i think about

466
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,560
me as a 60 year old as an 80 year old

467
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,800
i'll probably be making art

468
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,480
that speaks to me a lot more time is

469
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,959
just such a gift every day is such a

470
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,199
gift

471
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,000
your health your body is a gift don't

472
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,480
don't forget that

473
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
don't let the fast-paced world the

474
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,519
consumer's capitalist world like

475
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,720
convince you that you're never enough or

476
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,880
you'll never get there

477
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,000
not feeling as rushed and knowing like i

478
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,079
have the time to get

479
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,480
there someday even if it takes me

480
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:01,600
decades given that i will be blessed

481
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,639
with a long life i hope to live into

482
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,920
three digits

483
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,680
you're right that the world is still

484
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,720
around and not burned to the ground

485
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:11,360
by that time what will my art be then so

486
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,000
in that sense i'm not so worried about

487
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,839
where i'm going and how many skills i

488
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,440
will obtain because

489
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:22,320
every day is just a new opportunity to

490
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,399
improve those skills to learn more

491
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,519
lastly the miscellaneous stuff

492
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,079
has my style changed i'm kind of at this

493
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,120
blank

494
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:33,040
canvas point in my life where like you

495
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,839
know my hair's grown out now it's all

496
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,519
natural

497
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,199
the funniest thing is that i kind of

498
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,279
miss having damaged

499
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,519
dyed hair because when it was kind of

500
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:44,560
dry and crispy it had some

501
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,160
texture i need some volume you realize

502
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,519
that my head is extra small

503
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,519
when i was in middle school i had an

504
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,000
inside joke with a guy who i called

505
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,680
bigfoot

506
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,360
right before puberty his feet started

507
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,839
growing faster than the rest of his body

508
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,360
so

509
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,880
i called him bigfoot every time i saw

510
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,600
him he called me small head he'll be

511
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,440
like bigfoot

512
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,880
small head so i'm excited i think i'm

513
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,360
reinventing myself

514
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,439
definitely want to make a glow up video

515
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,839
i really enjoy watching those

516
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,760
as well as transformation videos i still

517
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,799
haven't transformed myself into my high

518
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,839
school self

519
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:16,319
i saw uh some footage and i was like

520
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,679
i was sexy when i was a minor look at me

521
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,240
now i like your hair

522
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,000
i quite enjoy how my dark hair looks the

523
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,760
last time i had long black hair was when

524
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,319
i was 15

525
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,400
so it's been a long time i might as well

526
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:31,520
try try to see if i can grow it out

527
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,080
and before i had a lot of it thinned out

528
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,000
due to

529
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,200
the trendy layer cut at the time

530
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,679
everyone was getting their

531
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,440
tips thinned out so i want to see how

532
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,480
nice and thick my hair might look like

533
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,679
hopefully it won't be too

534
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:46,320
flat and maybe i can even donate my hair

535
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,960
if i could resist myself from dying it

536
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,880
we'll see

537
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,640
lastly i just want to talk about music

538
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,600
for one hot second what's my favorite

539
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,280

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,200
this morning

558
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,200
i didn't like it as much as i thought it

559
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,880
would however i find that

560
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,400
all lana songs i have to listen to it a

561
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,160
lot and it will grow on me and then i'll

562
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,240
become obsessed with it like exactly a

563
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,440
year and a half after the release date a

564
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,880
lot of the songs

565
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,559
seem super similar whereas i feel like

566
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,440
in her previous albums

567
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:57,200
they all had their own story whereas

568
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,720
this one was like the whole album was a

569
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,039
continuous

570
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,799
song in a way with different chapters so

571
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:06,080
my favorite song as of now

572
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:08,240
is probably not all those who wander

573
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:11,280
lost or yosemite

574
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:13,600
and again this is gonna change

575
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,320
because from norman [ __ ] rockwell my

576
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:18,080
favorite song

577
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:22,320
was cherry wait was bartender

578
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:24,799
and then now it's probably

579
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,400
mariner's apartment complex for sure

580
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,080
those are all the questions for today

581
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,400
it's getting hot and i don't shave my

582
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,000

587
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,039
current events i want to talk about a

588
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,160
fundraiser that i'm doing

589
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,799
the link is right there in the

590
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,799
description and just by

591
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,799
announcing it on instagram in the last

592
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:51,520
day we've raised 1500

593
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:53,679
which is incredible i made this nice

594
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,840
painting of bambi sleeping

595
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,679
need a little bit of peace and con one

596
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,160
winner is gonna be drawn in a week it's

597
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:03,280
open worldwide the shipping is included

598
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:06,559
so in order to enter it's five dollars

599
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:09,360
minimum to purchase an entry ticket

600
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,919
or you can share it on a social platform

601
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,679
i think

602
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,799
for one free entry and the drawing would

603
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,440
be generated on

604
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:19,360
better world the organization 100 of

605
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,159
profits are going to

606
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,280
be donated to the asian american pacific

607
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,200
islander

608
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,880
community relief fund so i hope that

609
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,480
doing this video would

610
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,400
notify some people who don't follow me

611
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,159
on instagram also if you

612
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,600
are not interested in getting this

613
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,480
painting because you just don't like it

614
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,480
you can also

615
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,880
donate to other organizations and

616
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,600
gofundmes of members of the aapi

617
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,840
community

618
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,280
so you don't have to actually use my

619
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,720
fundraiser but i just wanted to let you

620
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,200
