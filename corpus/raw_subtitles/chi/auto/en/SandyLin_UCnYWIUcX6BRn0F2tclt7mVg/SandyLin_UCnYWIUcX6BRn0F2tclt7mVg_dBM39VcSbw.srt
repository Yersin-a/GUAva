name is sandy today I'm finally doing

5
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:16,770
the college slash post-grad Q&A I asked

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,840
you guys for any questions you had about

7
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,630
college and post-grad life on my

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,350
Instagram and now I am finally going to

9
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,570
answer them

10
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,939
I have all your questions compiled on my

11
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,949
macbook actually I tried to pick the

12
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:30,960
ones that were most frequently asked and

13
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:32,969
the topics that were like really

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,420
standing out to me without further ado I

15
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:37,860
guess we can just get started and I will

16
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:40,920
start doing my makeup I'm really excited

17
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:43,230
today because I am going to use the 3c e

18
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,120
palette that I just got I already did my

19
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:48,180
base because I had a big breakout that I

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,090
really which is not not wanting to show

21
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,949
the world but for my base I used the

22
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:56,190
herb Orion glow creme which I've been

23
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:58,289
raving about recently and also my it

24
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,270
cosmetics bye bye foundation full

25
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:03,030
coverage moisturizer and then for a

26
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,260
concealer for those giant breakouts I

27
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,229
used my Kevyn Aucoin

28
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,450
super natural concealer yeah now I'm

29
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:11,460
just gonna move on to my brows and let's

30
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,170
move on to the first question while I do

31
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,299
that so the first question comes from

32
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,680
post nostalgia she has two questions

33
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,540
what's the biggest difference between

34
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,820
high school and college and how do you

35
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,979
put yourself out there freshman year in

36
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,080
college I think the biggest difference

37
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:26,759
between high school and college is that

38
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,979
in high school

39
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,659
people are still kind of keeping tabs on

40
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:32,880
you people are still checking for your

41
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:34,950
attendance they're still checking that

42
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,979
you're getting to your classes on time

43
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,689
and you're doing your homework you know

44
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:41,909
your teachers your professors they know

45
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:43,799
you by name they know your face they can

46
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:46,470
track you down if they really really

47
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,149
wanted to but in college there's none of

48
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:51,119
that unless you're in a really small

49
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:52,680
class your professor your teacher is not

50
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,299
going to know your name classes instead

51
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:59,520
of being 20 to 30 people it's now like

52
00:01:56,299 --> 00:02:01,680
300 people and I think that is on the

53
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,119
lower end there's really no one telling

54
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,710
you what to do and telling you that

55
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,409
school is good for you you kind of have

56
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:10,110
to learn that on your own you have to

57
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:12,150
learn how to appreciate school and your

58
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,290
education on your own

59
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,000
not something that I don't think I

60
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:17,010
really appreciated when I was in college

61
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,360
I was just going through the motions and

62
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:20,040
trying to graduate and get through it

63
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,010
unless you're going into a smaller

64
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,230
college you're pretty much like a little

65
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:27,989
fish in a big pond is that how this

66
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:30,420
thing goes I'm not sure and if you are

67
00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:32,599
going to a big school a big college

68
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:35,250
there's no longer a popularity contest

69
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:39,209
personally loved that there was no more

70
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:41,489
like popularity concept in college I was

71
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:43,290
never a popular kid in high school and I

72
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:45,000
hated wanting to be popular and in

73
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:47,940
college I just felt like I could finally

74
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,349
just do my own thing and be myself and

75
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,760
no one really judged you for that

76
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:52,980
because there's just so many different

77
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,299
people in college who are into different

78
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,829
things and I think that's where you

79
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:58,709
really learn to appreciate the

80
00:02:55,829 --> 00:03:00,599
differences and uniqueness and people

81
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:02,129
and then for the second question how do

82
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:04,200
you put yourself out there as a freshman

83
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:05,819
honestly freshman year is the time to do

84
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,849
it especially if you're in dorms

85
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:11,280
everyone is just so happy and excited

86
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:12,959
and eager to meet people and to make

87
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,849
friends that's the time that you should

88
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,889
really put yourself out there and just

89
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:18,780
say hi to people ask them what they're

90
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:20,760
interested in where they're from what

91
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,949
they like to do that really is the time

92
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,049
to get to know someone because after

93
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:26,519
that it gets a lot harder as a freshman

94
00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:27,810
you can be seen as like that eager

95
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:29,220
freshman that's just like trying to meet

96
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:31,230
people because you don't know anyone but

97
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,760
sophomore junior year senior obviously

98
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,769
it's a little bit harder to use that I'm

99
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,180
a freshman excuse yeah just really put

100
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:38,220
yourself out there and be bold you

101
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,569
probably don't know a lot of people in

102
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:42,299
your college like you did in high school

103
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:43,889
and I find that it's a lot easier to be

104
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:46,739
yourself and not be afraid to be

105
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:48,959
yourself you can join clubs or like

106
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:51,030
fraternities organizations whatever it

107
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,760
is that you like there's probably a club

108
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,919
or an organization created that suits

109
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,650
your passions and your hobbies college

110
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:00,150
campus is so huge your feel for sure I

111
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,319
find someone who likes the same things

112
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,760
that you do you just have to put

113
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:04,319
yourself out there and find it because

114
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,060
if you don't if you don't express

115
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,979
yourself and who you are and what you

116
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,780
like how are you going to attract the

117
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:12,540
people or bring yourself to the people

118
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:14,250
who could be your best friends having

119
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:16,169
brows on my face just makes me feel like

120
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:20,070
a whole new woman and the next question

121
00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:22,200
is from hi you Lurie Hillary I always

122
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:24,719
want to say it hi you Larry how do you

123
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,710
stay motivated for school I need help

124
00:04:24,719 --> 00:04:27,720
how I say

125
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:32,100
motivated personally is I surrounded

126
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:35,099
myself with people who are motivated I

127
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,900
sucked their energy just kidding but no

128
00:04:35,099 --> 00:04:40,139
seriously during sophomore year of

129
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:42,360
college I joined a business fraternity

130
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:45,090
because I felt like I needed people

131
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,680
around me who knew more than I did that

132
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,539
I could learn from and that I could grow

133
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:52,349
from when you join a business for

134
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:54,990
eternity like everyone is just hustling

135
00:04:52,349 --> 00:04:56,639
at least majority of people are hustling

136
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:58,470
and they're getting their done

137
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,180
they're studying they're working hard

138
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:01,949
they're applying for jobs so the way

139
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,419
that I stay motivated was that I studied

140
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:05,550
with them I hung out with them and like

141
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:07,620
obviously they were my friends so I

142
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:09,419
enjoyed hanging out with them also but

143
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,910
seeing how motivated those people were

144
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:13,830
made me want to be motivated and do more

145
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:16,199
so definitely surround yourself with

146
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:18,150
good people and people who you look up

147
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:20,039
to and who are already very motivating

148
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:22,289
and that you just like gravitate towards

149
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:24,840
and push you to do more and be better so

150
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:27,030
I think I'm going to take these colors I

151
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,099
don't know we'll see another way to stay

152
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:30,449
motivated is to kind of remember why

153
00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:31,050
you're in school and why you're doing

154
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:32,820
what you're doing

155
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:34,560
honestly can be a little bit hard if

156
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:36,150
you're in school for your parents I was

157
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,310
kind of in that position where I was in

158
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:40,500
school from my parents like I didn't

159
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:41,759
want to go to school first I wanted to

160
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,979
take a year off to figure out what I

161
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,690
wanted to do but they really wanted me

162
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:47,370
to go to school and so I did and I did

163
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:49,169
it to make them happy and I didn't

164
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,789
really appreciate an education or why I

165
00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:52,289
was there I know that's not always the

166
00:05:50,789 --> 00:05:53,849
case for everyone you know if you're in

167
00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:55,229
school to get your dream job like

168
00:05:53,849 --> 00:05:57,180
remember that remember that's why you're

169
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:58,889
getting good grades it's why you're

170
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,960
sticking through with all the hard stuff

171
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:02,849
it's so you can get your dream job I

172
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,310
know I can be hard to stay motivated if

173
00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:06,870
you don't know what your dream job is or

174
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,740
you don't know what your major is and

175
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:10,139
you don't know what you want to do with

176
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:12,210
your life but honestly I wish I

177
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:13,889
appreciated education and getting an

178
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:15,090
education a little bit more I wish I

179
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:16,889
knew what it meant

180
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:19,020
to be able to get an education because

181
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:21,030
it's so hard to do that now it's such a

182
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:23,880
privilege to be able to go to school and

183
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:25,740
to get that higher education so that in

184
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,229
itself I hope is motivating enough

185
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:30,060
because not everyone gets the chance to

186
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:32,729
do that so the next question comes from

187
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:35,099
from Yvonne and she asks hardest

188
00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:36,990
adjustment after graduating college for

189
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:38,350
me the hardest adjustment after

190
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:41,260
graduating college

191
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:42,970
is having to make my own decisions even

192
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,920
in college you're still being told what

193
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:46,510
kind of classes you need to take what

194
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,280
you need to do in order to graduate but

195
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:50,410
after you graduate you can do whatever

196
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,820
you want and you have to decide do I

197
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,770
want to travel do I want to take a year

198
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,450
off and not work do I want a job what

199
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:58,750
kind of job do I want it felt like a lot

200
00:06:55,450 --> 00:07:00,670
of weight was put on me to make the

201
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,840
right decision and you don't know what

202
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,820
the right decision is you don't know

203
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,800
what one path is going to take you a

204
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:07,120
versus another like you can't see that

205
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,060
and you can't know that that was a

206
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,500
really hard realization that I had after

207
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,870
I graduated I have to make my own

208
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:16,150
decisions I don't know what to do okay

209
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:17,860
now I think I'm going to use this middle

210
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:20,070
color I just used these two colors as

211
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:23,770
like a base the next question comes from

212
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:25,000
Jael xvii what was one of the most

213
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:27,160
important lessons you learned from

214
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,990
college and how did you use / apply it

215
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,060
to real life after college it doesn't

216
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:33,100
have to be school related it can just be

217
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:36,070
a life lesson - can't wait for the video

218
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:37,240
and love you I love you - thank you so

219
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,950
much for the question

220
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,770
it's a little bit of what I said earlier

221
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:44,200
and it's that you are responsible for

222
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:46,870
your own future like college gives you a

223
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,910
taste of it after graduation is when you

224
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:50,380
really are responsible for it but in

225
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:52,600
college is when you get a taste of it

226
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:54,850
and you have to take responsibility for

227
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,290
your future and then and what you want

228
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:58,210
your future to look like and the life

229
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:59,800
that you want to build no one really

230
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:01,060
exactly knows what you went through like

231
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,070
your parents and your siblings were

232
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,480
there for you growing up but they're not

233
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,800
there for you in college they don't know

234
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,060
what you're going through and like your

235
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,050
friends they know what you're going

236
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,090
through now but they don't know what

237
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:12,400
your childhood dreams were like they

238
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:15,340
don't know that much about you just yet

239
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,710
and so you really are responsible for

240
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:19,240
yourself and only you know yourself the

241
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:21,670
most I still struggle with that

242
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,500
sometimes where I don't really know what

243
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:26,050
I want and I don't know myself that well

244
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:29,050
but college is definitely the best place

245
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:31,660
and time to start figuring that out take

246
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,950
control of your future no one's gonna

247
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:34,840
force you to go to the TA

248
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:36,969
no one's gonna force you to go talk to

249
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,770
your professor if you're struggling no

250
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:39,849
one's gonna come like scoop you up if

251
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:41,500
you're really in trouble

252
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:43,210
if you fail a class you fail a class

253
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,950
that's it no one's gonna scoop you up

254
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:46,540
and tell you what you need to do to

255
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:48,520
succeed you have to figure it out on

256
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:51,080
your own and that was one of the hardest

257
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:54,440
lessons I learned next question

258
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:56,720
comes from Chris I think it's Christian

259
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,340
Christian what did you discover about

260
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,010
yourself that you already didn't know

261
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:02,990
while in college one I'm not good at

262
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:04,820
school that is one of the first things I

263
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:06,650
discovered about myself because growing

264
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:08,300
up I always had someone telling me what

265
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:10,040
to do like parents keeping tabs on me

266
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:12,560
teachers making sure I did my homework

267
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:14,120
and I obeyed I was really good at obey

268
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,400
and doing what I was told because I

269
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,950
wanted to avoid punishment and that was

270
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:21,290
my main motivator going to school I did

271
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:23,450
everything a good student was supposed

272
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:26,570
to do once I got to college and I had to

273
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:29,420
study on my own and like really learn

274
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:30,740
for myself I was not good at that I was

275
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:32,690
not good at school I was not good at

276
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:34,550
studying I didn't like it I just didn't

277
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:37,100
know how to discipline myself and that's

278
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:38,830
when I realized like schools not for me

279
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,940
I know I've been going off about

280
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:42,980
appreciating your education and I still

281
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:45,110
think that's really important but for me

282
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:48,380
the way that I learned in school and

283
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:51,200
studying and disciplining myself it was

284
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:52,790
so hard they were joining like a

285
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,780
business fraternity I learned a lot

286
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:58,760
about myself personally and that's where

287
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:01,280
I learned like hey I'm pretty decent at

288
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:02,960
public speaking I can talk I can make a

289
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,210
PowerPoint presentation I can relay

290
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:07,070
information I learned what I good out

291
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:09,050
what takes me off I learned a lot about

292
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:11,450
myself through the friends that I had

293
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:13,550
the relationships that I made you just

294
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:15,500
grow a lot as a person by surrounding

295
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:17,930
yourself with different people and I

296
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:20,030
think that's one of the most valuable

297
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:22,160
experiences about going off to college

298
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:24,980
so I just added a little bit of this

299
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,660
brown from the three seee palette but I

300
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:29,300
also wanted a darker Brown so I'm using

301
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:32,900
this brown from my NARS palette the next

302
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:34,550
question comes from me Lyons solo 7 do

303
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:37,180
you recommend to find a job or an

304
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:39,500
internship after college I recommend

305
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:41,600
personally from experience that you get

306
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:44,180
an internship while you're in college at

307
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,220
least the summer after your junior year

308
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:48,230
if you really want to be an overachiever

309
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,970
then get an internship at the end of

310
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:52,550
your sophomore year it will help you a

311
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:53,720
lot I think so like I wish I got an

312
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:55,220
internship at the end of my sophomore

313
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,720
year instead of my junior year so that I

314
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,430
could have more experiences under my

315
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,590
belt after you graduate and you'll have

316
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:04,010
a lot of experience to hopefully propel

317
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:04,640
you into a full-time paid job I'm going

318
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:06,140
to go back to

319
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,420
three sieep out real quick and just add

320
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:10,730
some color to the under eye area I'm

321
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:14,600
gonna use this Center shade and then

322
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:17,150
this brown on the bottom okay I'm going

323
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,730
to pop on some brown eyeliner this is

324
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:21,710
from Susie lux I caught this a while ago

325
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:23,120
and it's the only brown liquid eyeliner

326
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:26,240
I have so I'm just gonna go with that

327
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,280
put on some lashes this is from I don't

328
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,480
know it's an Asian brand there alright I

329
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,010
just want to try something different

330
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,780
today and go for like a different look

331
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:34,070
but yeah I'm gonna do that off-camera so

332
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:36,380
I will be right back

333
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:38,630
I wasn't feeling these lashes at first

334
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:40,880
but now that I've curled them I like

335
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:43,190
them a lot more I'm gonna apply some

336
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,680
mascara to it actually picking it up

337
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:48,230
because it'll look kind of sparse these

338
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,030
are actually some really nice lashes I

339
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:52,430
don't know why I didn't like them the

340
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:54,950
first time around okay

341
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:57,080
now I'm going to move on to contouring

342
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:59,150
and answer the next batch of questions

343
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:02,060
so I actually got a lot of questions

344
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:03,860
about figuring out what is right for you

345
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:06,200
let me just read these off I have

346
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:07,730
absolutely no idea what I want to study

347
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,760
and when I think about it it's a whole

348
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:12,290
mess whenever I find what I want to do

349
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,240
my parents disagree how do you figure

350
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:16,130
out what's right for you hi my question

351
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,500
is did you know what you wanted to do

352
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:20,000
right after you graduated and if not how

353
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,950
did you figure out your life post

354
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,600
college how is it transitioning from

355
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:25,430
graduating college to finding work how

356
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,410
did you get your first job or first real

357
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:28,880
job was it mainly because you had a ton

358
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:31,010
of experience under your belt prior to

359
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,630
graduating I'm going to graduate soon

360
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:35,390
and I don't know what I'm doing after

361
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:37,100
how do I start the post-grad life okay

362
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:38,480
so lots of questions about figuring out

363
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,300
what you want to do with your life and

364
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,430
let me just tell you a little bit about

365
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:45,350
my experience so in high school I had no

366
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:47,450
idea what I wanted to go to college to

367
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:49,340
do I thought I wanted to be a marine

368
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:52,070
biologist because I really loved the

369
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:54,400
ocean so I applied to a marine biology

370
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:56,540
school I got in but I decided not to go

371
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:59,750
because income-wise

372
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:01,910
it's not the best and I didn't know if I

373
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:04,070
could actually do that it just didn't

374
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:06,770
feel right so I ended up going to UC

375
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:09,410
Davis as a political science major I

376
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:11,720
really wanted to make a difference in

377
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:13,790
the world and I thought being a senator

378
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,180
was the best way I could learn how to do

379
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,290
it

380
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:18,170
I'm just going to contour real quick

381
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:19,940
this is the Avon true color contour

382
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:22,670
stick I'm gonna use this to contour my

383
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:24,260
nose but as I was saying I thought I

384
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:25,970
will want it to be a political science

385
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:27,800
major so I was taking political science

386
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:29,810
classes and when I was in there in those

387
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,130
classes that's when I realized like this

388
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:34,700
isn't for me this isn't what I wanted to

389
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:36,709
do then I thought this looks crazy then

390
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:38,990
I thought you know I really like writing

391
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:42,890
so maybe I'll be an English major and I

392
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:45,860
was in that English major for a class or

393
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:47,779
two I took like some writing class and

394
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:50,120
then some like literature class when I

395
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:52,820
was there I realized I loved to write

396
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,830
but I hate writing for this class and

397
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:56,660
maybe that means like this isn't for me

398
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:58,910
maybe I just like free writing writing

399
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:02,450
on my own free time so then I thought

400
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:04,760
maybe I will give business a try it's

401
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:06,470
open-ended I can be creative I can get

402
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:09,500
into marketing I've always liked

403
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:11,540
marketing like in high school I did a

404
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:14,390
little bit of marketing like for this

405
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:16,370
class and then I was taking economics

406
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:18,620
classes and it just kind of stuck it was

407
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:20,690
something that I felt like I could do

408
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:22,520
this I belonged here I was also

409
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:24,950
interested in fashion so I did a fashion

410
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:26,930
marketing internship and you know it

411
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:29,330
wasn't the best internship it just

412
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:31,279
sucked do you know honestly but I still

413
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:32,750
loved it enough to stick with it even

414
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,610
though my experience my internship

415
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:36,770
experience is kind of shitty like I

416
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:38,720
still knew like I wanted to do fashion

417
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:40,250
and I want to do marketing like that

418
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,959
didn't stop me from doing what I wanted

419
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,310
to do I just knew that even though this

420
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:43,700
experience sucked I still want to keep

421
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:46,010
at it

422
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:49,130
and so I ended up graduating with a

423
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:50,630
double major in econ and communications

424
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:52,940
and they didn't have a marketing major

425
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:54,800
at UC Davis and that was kind of one of

426
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:56,660
the closest things I thought to it so

427
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,430
then I went off to get my first

428
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:00,470
marketing job and I worked in marketing

429
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:02,779
for about four years in an office and

430
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:04,700
then I realized I want to work in an

431
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:07,400
office anymore and that's when I you

432
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,959
know quit my corporate job and started

433
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,940
doing youtube full-time and doing

434
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,740
something even more creative than

435
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:14,540
marketing numbers and analytics and

436
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:16,399
whatnot yeah my parents probably

437
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,990
disagreed with me you know like they

438
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,490
gave me a lot of freedom in college to

439
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:21,050
figure out what I wanted to do and then

440
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:23,240
after college when I you know when I

441
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:24,740
decided to quit my job I'm sure they

442
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,390
didn't agree with me surely

443
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,370
my mom is a little bit disappointed in

444
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:30,170
me I was like on the right track to do

445
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:32,090
really well in marketing I was on her I

446
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:35,000
was on a pretty great track I had a

447
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:36,740
great job but it wasn't for me and so to

448
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,480
answer one of the questions what happens

449
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:40,010
in your parents always disagree with you

450
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,030
it happens parents are gonna disagree

451
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,710
with you your friends might disagree

452
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,940
with you society is gonna disagree with

453
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:45,620
you and what you want to do you just

454
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,730
have to be confident in yourself and

455
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:48,890
believe that you're making the right

456
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:51,260
decision for yourself a lot of my

457
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:52,760
success in school was because I wanted

458
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:54,320
to avoid punishment I wanted to avoid

459
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:57,230
conflict with my parents and I did

460
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,180
everything that I could to please them

461
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:00,110
and to make them happy Indiana didn't

462
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,430
make me happy

463
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:03,140
so even though you're dealing with

464
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:05,090
disagreements with your parents now in

465
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,950
the end if you feel like it's totally

466
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:08,510
completely worth it to follow your heart

467
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:10,100
and do what you want to do because if

468
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,390
you know you can prove yourself and be

469
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,940
successful at what you want to do one

470
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:15,890
day it's worth the disagreement when my

471
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:18,440
parents doubted me it was because they

472
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:19,910
could sense doubt in myself I didn't

473
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:23,390
believe in myself because I didn't

474
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:25,310
really I thought I wanted to be I felt

475
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:27,080
like I had to prove that I could make my

476
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:29,150
own decisions and make my own mistakes

477
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,930
and learn and grow from them and that I

478
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,520
would be okay

479
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:33,050
I needed to be confident in myself for

480
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,830
them to be confident in me and what I'm

481
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:35,600
doing

482
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:37,190
you just have to believe in yourself and

483
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,570
stick with what you want to do and

484
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:40,370
sometimes you might not find that right

485
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:42,560
away but it's okay I put a lot of

486
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:44,510
pressure on myself to be successful but

487
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,650
I was doubtful and I was scared and I

488
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:48,020
like I don't know what's gonna happen

489
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:49,160
but in the end I realize like you know

490
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:51,920
what I don't know what's gonna happen

491
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:54,230
but I know that this is my time to learn

492
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:57,380
and to grow and make my own mistakes and

493
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:59,900
I think once I told my mom not she asked

494
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:01,610
me if I'm ever scared or worried that

495
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:03,830
I'm not making money or that I'm out

496
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:06,110
here doing this kind of stuff and I told

497
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:09,140
her like yeah it's stressful sometimes

498
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:11,360
it's stressful but I'm learning and I'm

499
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:13,190
growing and I'm really happy and this is

500
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,900
what makes me happy but stressful but

501
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:16,790
it's worth it I just need this time to

502
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,110
learn and grow in my own and if this

503
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:19,760
doesn't work out then I'll move on to

504
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:21,650
the next thing and it'll be fine

505
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:25,010
everything will be fine I think for my

506
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:27,110
mom to hear that and to be reassured and

507
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:30,110
to hear that I'm happy doing what I want

508
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:31,850
to do was enough it was enough for her

509
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:33,770
to support me because I believed in it

510
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:35,420
myself that you know I'm gonna be okay

511
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:37,040
no matter what I'm gonna be okay

512
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,470
and I think you need to find that

513
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,179
confidence

514
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:41,640
and yourself to figure it out your own

515
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:43,650
way in order for your parents to agree

516
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,059
with you or to support you I think it's

517
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:46,830
just in the end finding that

518
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:50,970
understanding and that common ground is

519
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:53,250
what is just really important you don't

520
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:54,780
have to know the answers your parents

521
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,039
for sure don't know the answers but I

522
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:58,440
think at the end of the day you need to

523
00:17:56,039 --> 00:18:00,120
know that you'll be okay I need it to

524
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,919
accept that I don't know what's gonna

525
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,179
happen I don't have all the answers I

526
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,490
don't know what my future is gonna be

527
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:07,919
like but I'm confident in myself and

528
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:10,080
what my parents have taught me and what

529
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,600
I've learned that no matter what I will

530
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,820
be okay in the end I had to redefine

531
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,350
what success meant for me to when I was

532
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,299
working a corporate job I was like

533
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:20,880
success to me means I'm a manager I'm a

534
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:24,179
director at this really amazing firm

535
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,440
this amazing company I make X amount of

536
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:26,850
money I'm gonna have a house by a

537
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,950
certain age you just kinda have to

538
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:31,020
redefine what happiness and what success

539
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:32,850
means to you because those things will

540
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,919
hinder you they hindered me because for

541
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:36,570
the longest time I was thinking like I'm

542
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:38,940
not gonna own a house by the time I'm 30

543
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:40,470
I'm not gonna make X amount of money by

544
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,059
this time and I think for the longest

545
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:43,890
time I was hindering myself because I

546
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:46,200
believed it had to be this version of

547
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:48,780
myself like this version of a person in

548
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:51,570
order to be successful and I really had

549
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:54,390
to change my mentality I'm not in order

550
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:56,190
to to continue doing this okay I've gone

551
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:57,780
back and forth a few times with the lip

552
00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:00,419
color but I finally decided I'm going to

553
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:05,159
use frente beauties Redis is called like

554
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:09,450
their mat mat Mosel mat mat mat mat okay

555
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:10,919
whatever and this is the color up to no

556
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:13,190
good that was so tight and then I'm

557
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:18,679
going to layer that with Pony effect

558
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:20,789
magnificent I really love this color but

559
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:22,860
it just doesn't go that well with my

560
00:19:20,789 --> 00:19:26,190
skin tone on its own like I feel like a

561
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:27,240
Kardashian right now so I'm just gonna

562
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:29,070
layer this on

563
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,620
wow it's raining really hard outside

564
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:33,870
right now but just to go back on the

565
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:35,789
last few questions about figuring out

566
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:38,010
what you want to do with your life and

567
00:19:35,789 --> 00:19:41,220
or what you want to do post-grad what

568
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:44,280
you want to major in I have three types

569
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:46,289
of advice I guess so one listen to your

570
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,179
gut follow your heart do what you love

571
00:19:46,289 --> 00:19:51,240
to do and follow what you're really

572
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:52,800
passionate about to be bold

573
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,040
be afraid to put yourself out there and

574
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:59,100
to try anything that you're even mildly

575
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:00,540
interested in or curious about do it if

576
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:03,120
you feel like in your heart like you

577
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:05,250
really want to try maybe like art you

578
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,570
want to be a painter or something put

579
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,860
yourself out there don't say like I'm

580
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:10,740
not good enough I can't take that art

581
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:11,790
class I can't I can't don't say that and

582
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,650
don't hinder yourself

583
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:16,290
be bold put yourself out there and try

584
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:20,160
it out because that's how you really get

585
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:22,050
to learn and know if that path is for

586
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,610
you like when I went to college I went

587
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:25,620
in as a political science major you know

588
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:27,780
sitting in those classes it really

589
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:29,520
forced me to think like is this where I

590
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:32,580
want to be right now am i passionate

591
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,200
enough about this to put up with all of

592
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:35,220
that pretty much like when I went to

593
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,960
those classes I just felt really

594
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:39,360
different from everyone there I felt

595
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,460
very out of place it just didn't feel

596
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,570
like it was well suited for me because I

597
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,460
would look around in all the students

598
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:45,809
and they were so well educated they were

599
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,470
so smart and still passionate about

600
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:47,640
politics

601
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:49,770
I thought I was passionate about

602
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,570
politics and helping Society and whatnot

603
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:53,429
but seeing all these other students and

604
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:55,770
seeing how they had that drive and I did

605
00:20:53,429 --> 00:20:57,990
it that to me told me like I don't want

606
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:59,610
to do this this isn't for me like I love

607
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:01,590
aspects about political science but as a

608
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:03,929
career choice this isn't it this wasn't

609
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:04,830
for me after that I tried writing like I

610
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,420
didn't know if I was a good enough

611
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:08,640
writer I just knew that I loved to write

612
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:11,160
and maybe it could be a career Avenue I

613
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,710
took my first writing class and I loved

614
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:15,270
writing but in on closeted just I wasn't

615
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:17,490
passionate how will you know if

616
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:19,920
something is for you or not if you don't

617
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:23,610
put yourself out there and try it that's

618
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:25,290
number two just be bold do it try it if

619
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:26,429
it's not for you it's not for you and

620
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:28,170
you'll learn that throughout that

621
00:21:26,429 --> 00:21:29,490
process and if it is for you and you're

622
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:31,890
passionate about it then you'll push

623
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:34,260
forward and you'll find that place

624
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:36,270
that's just for you and third third

625
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:39,960
thing is just know that what is right

626
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:42,750
for you now can change in the future and

627
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:44,100
that's exactly what happened to me like

628
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,330
I thought I wanted to work in a

629
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:48,210
corporate marketing job and wear

630
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:50,760
business casual attire all the time not

631
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:52,320
the case not like hazel at all I changed

632
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,700
my direction like I'm doing something so

633
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,250
different from what I used to do and

634
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:57,750
initially that really scared me the idea

635
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,520
or the thought of starting over

636
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:02,550
starting from zero starting from scratch

637
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:04,710
really scared me but you can't let that

638
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:06,179
hinder you from living like your

639
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:07,980
life even though there are times where

640
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:09,840
I'm stressed out or I worry like I'm

641
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:12,000
still so much happier now that I

642
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,950
followed what I wanted to do and I

643
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,690
followed my heart it just makes me so

644
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:17,850
much more happier yeah those three

645
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:20,309
things let me recount one listen to your

646
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:22,710
heart two people try everything three

647
00:22:20,309 --> 00:22:23,549
what you want now may not be what you

648
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:25,770
want in the future

649
00:22:23,549 --> 00:22:28,020
or what you want now may not be what you

650
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:29,850
have one and then same thing at the end

651
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:32,669
of the day I am still kind of learning

652
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:33,809
how to live my life and these are just

653
00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:36,120
kind of the experiences that I've had

654
00:22:33,809 --> 00:22:37,649
that I want to share with you but every

655
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,720
experience is different every experience

656
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:42,059
is unique so you know take what I say

657
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:44,820
with a grain of salt but if it helps you

658
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:46,470
then I am so incredibly happy that it

659
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,490

660
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:49,049
