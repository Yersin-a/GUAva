there you go so let's start with the

21
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,770
questions I got on YouTube Veronica Chan

22
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,800
asked how did you start your YouTube

23
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:50,789
career and what's your nationality

24
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:52,770
nationality I'm American if you're asked

25
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:54,629
about ethnicity I'm Chinese so I'm

26
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,070
chinese-american going back to the first

27
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:58,289
question how did you start your YouTube

28
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:01,460
career I don't know if I could call this

29
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:05,460
a career but I started doing YouTube

30
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:08,400
well I've always been really into blogs

31
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,439
and websites and coding and design have

32
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,930
always loved that like that digital

33
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:14,760
sphere I remember first starting on geo

34
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:18,119
cities if you guys remember geo cities

35
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:21,350
Zynga myspace tumblr Lisa explains calm

36
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:24,330
if anyone used like to learn coding

37
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:25,920
that's great sorry oh I was on Lisa

38
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:29,100
explains all the time as a kid and I

39
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,869
loved it it's a really old website that

40
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,210
teaches kids how to code so after

41
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:35,009
college I decided I wanted to start a

42
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,689
blog without involving all kinds of

43
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:38,070
blogs and I wanted to start my own and

44
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:40,140
talk about fashion because I love

45
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,210
fashion and self-expression through

46
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,490
fashion so I started blogging and around

47
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,290
the same time Karen also came out to her

48
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,909
YouTube channel like her first video and

49
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,500
we decided to get together help each

50
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:51,750
other out and she really encouraged me

51
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,659
to start posting videos as well and it

52
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,640
took me a really long time before I

53
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:57,509
started posting videos because it

54
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,490
freaked me out

55
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:01,829
eventually I did it and I loved it and I

56
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:04,140
loved editing and being creative but

57
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:06,000
that's how I started doing YouTube the

58
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,770
complex girls asked how has your

59
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,020
experience in LA been while working and

60
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,160
making YouTube videos love this video

61
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,500
can't wait for the Q

62
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,450
thank you in my last get ready with me

63
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,700
video I shared that I moved to LA and

64
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,950
started working at my friend's salon I

65
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,810
don't work there anymore I don't know

66
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,680
that I've ever shared that maybe on

67
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,360
Instagram

68
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,100
storage I don't think I have on YouTube

69
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,270
but I don't work ask my friend salon

70
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,370
anymore I'm still friends with them

71
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:32,220
thank goodness because they're amazing

72
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:34,110
people but I worked there for about two

73
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,600
weeks and then I quit I just wasn't a

74
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,640
good fit and I wasn't really a hundred

75
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,440
percent in it or feeling it felt like it

76
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,910
was the right thing to do I'm so

77
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,800
thankful for the opportunity that came

78
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,720
up and so thankful to Ivan for getting

79
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,250
me to come to LA because without that I

80
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,200
wouldn't have come here and I wouldn't

81
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,120
be making the content that I want to

82
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,310
make so now I'm just making content

83
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:58,410
full-time and how has my experience been

84
00:02:53,310 --> 00:03:01,170
in LA it's been crazy I guess a lot of

85
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:04,410
things came up I had to move a couple

86
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:06,330
times I've honestly felt like a nomad

87
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:08,640
been moving around a lot and trying to

88
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:11,340
balance filming within that schedule and

89
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:14,310
it's been hard I don't really feel like

90
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,959
I have a home of my own and I feel like

91
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:18,540
this is all very temporary until I

92
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,640
figure out what I want to do with my

93
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:23,100
life or until I can make money to

94
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,370
sustain myself the experience has been

95
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:28,800
stressful at times but overall amazing I

96
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:30,780
don't regret the decision to leave my

97
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,190
full-time job whatsoever there are

98
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,100
definitely times where I'm pondering

99
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:37,740
like do I need to go get a full-time job

100
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:39,930
again but that is very different from I

101
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:41,520
regret the decision I made I shouldn't

102
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,230
have left there is no part of me that

103
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:46,020
thinks that this whole thing has been a

104
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:48,090
learning experience and if I find out

105
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,500
that it's not for me then I'll just move

106
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:52,050
on to the next thing I realize that's

107
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,340
pretty awesome I think to be wondering

108
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:55,500
about what's nice and what's to come

109
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,820
rather than dwelling on what I did in

110
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,310
the past because there's nothing I can

111
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:01,350
do about that now really nice to be able

112
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:02,760
to talk about it and share that with you

113
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:04,680
guys I'm still kind of learning and

114
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,880
processing everything I can't believe

115
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,250
it's been six months since I've been

116
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:11,060
doing this it feels way shorter I feel

117
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:13,290
like I should have done more but anyway

118
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:15,450
that's kind of what the experience has

119
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,919
been like Raquel where we asked are

120
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:19,080
there any blogs or people that have

121
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:19,739
influenced your style love your videos

122
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,630
xx

123
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:23,889
thank your Aikau I don't follow any

124
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:25,749
blogs so much per se

125
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:27,939
follow a China people like on Instagram

126
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:30,699
but there isn't one specific person that

127
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:32,560
I really really need to follow I used to

128
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:34,749
follow a lot when I was in college like

129
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,539
cupcakes and cashmere fashion toast to

130
00:04:34,749 --> 00:04:39,639
gray layers chriselle lim I had a whole

131
00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:41,499
folder of bookmarks that I would just

132
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:43,210
open every morning I don't do that so

133
00:04:41,499 --> 00:04:45,099
much anymore I honestly don't know where

134
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:47,050
I'm drawing my inspiration frog I think

135
00:04:45,099 --> 00:04:47,919
it's from music right now any time I

136
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,409
listen to a song

137
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,300
I think of a story and I pretty much

138
00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:53,889
come up with the music video for the

139
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,629
song and that's kind of where I draw my

140
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:58,389
inspiration from like as you guys know

141
00:04:55,629 --> 00:05:00,849
I've been so and to BTS and kpop and not

142
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:02,770
Korean fashion I look at a lot of style

143
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:04,539
nonde photos for inspiration I don't

144
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:06,759
know that I like to necessarily started

145
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:08,979
dressing like them but I do look at

146
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:11,500
their photos and get inspired by them so

147
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:13,629
I guess I would say music and mood

148
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:16,539
influenced my style more than a specific

149
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:18,969
person or people you're gonna ask what

150
00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:21,310
do you do for a living I just do youtube

151
00:05:18,969 --> 00:05:22,810
full-time now you're way more on 13s

152
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,430
what future goals do you have for

153
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:27,099
yourself that you want to accomplish

154
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:28,990
this is the hardest question for me to

155
00:05:27,099 --> 00:05:30,879
answer at a front Chris if you're

156
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:31,870
watching you always ask me what are your

157
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:33,610
goals what are you trying to accomplish

158
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:36,339
like what are you trying to do and

159
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:38,710
honestly I don't know and I gave myself

160
00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:40,389
a whole year to kind of figure out what

161
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:43,360
it is that I like to do what it is that

162
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm good at and where do I go from there

163
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,680
what I do know when I was working

164
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,149
full-time was that I had a lot of ideas

165
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,219
in my head that I wanted to do

166
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:52,960
creatively and I didn't have a chance to

167
00:05:51,219 --> 00:05:54,490
do that while I was working and now I do

168
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,409
have a time to do that and right now I

169
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:57,819
just want to push out all those ideas as

170
00:05:56,409 --> 00:06:00,610
much as I can because I feel like it's

171
00:05:57,819 --> 00:06:04,060
all been like pent up in my mind and I

172
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:05,529
just want to get it out somehow I guess

173
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:07,569
that's my goal for right now is just

174
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:09,759
keep making content and figure out what

175
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:13,120
it is I like and who I am and what I

176
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:15,939
want to be oh yeah it sounds very basic

177
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,319
and generic and sad but that's just kind

178
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:19,870
of my goal for right now that's what I

179
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:22,839
want to focus on Maria I'm going to say

180
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:25,149
was so wrong Maria elgu lay what

181
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:26,169
inspires you most in life all right I

182
00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:29,169
don't know how to answer this question

183
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:30,699
is it like there's another question here

184
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:32,709
that says what keeps you going as in

185
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:34,320
motivated so I'm just going to mush

186
00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:39,600
those two together because I don't

187
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:41,640
know how to hook answer these bonds

188
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,890
here's a second one what keeps me going

189
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:48,870
um what Jason you've motivated is

190
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:51,270
actually my family and this is going to

191
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:52,230
be a very spiritual answer but bear with

192
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,760
me on this one

193
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:56,520
so when I was trying to decide whether

194
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:58,770
or not to leave my full-time job I was

195
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,690
praying about it a lot obviously it's a

196
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:02,280
very hard decision to make and as you

197
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:04,530
can tell it's something that's very

198
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,600
different from the routine and the

199
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:08,040
security that I used to have it's very

200
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,600
different for the future my parents

201
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,220
planned out for me this is so hard to

202
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,380
explain I need to make it to the other

203
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:15,090
side and be successful whatever success

204
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,580
is maybe it's me finding out I need to

205
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:18,630
go back to full-time and leave being

206
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:20,130
independent going through this hardship

207
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:21,540
if I can make it on the other side and

208
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:23,880
show my family what I did and what I was

209
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:26,070
able to accomplish as an adult making my

210
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,290
own decision I can prove to them that I

211
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:30,480
got through this entire thing because I

212
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:31,830
had faith in God this is what I was kind

213
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,740
of want to show them is that I could do

214
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:37,020
all things because God is on my side I'm

215
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,310
sorry I thought spiritual there for a

216
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,290
little bit I hope you guys can

217
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:42,990
understand I'm very open minded when it

218
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:45,230
comes to spirituality I don't like using

219
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:48,090
the word religion post nostalgia

220
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:50,040
favorite songs at the moment glad you

221
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:51,840
asked this because I actually start

222
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,550
sharing my Spotify playlists in my

223
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,080
description bar below so if you're

224
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:56,970
interested in the songs that I'm

225
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,430
currently listening to you can click on

226
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:00,960
that link right now it's a lot of kpop

227
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:03,300
the kind of kpop I like is very

228
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,160
westernized if you're kind of curious in

229
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:08,400
k-pop I think you can listen to my

230
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,730
playlist and see that it's not what you

231
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,800
think

232
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:12,870
I guess I don't know okay I don't know

233
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,650
if that make sense favorite hobbies any

234
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:18,930
hobbies you want to take up hmm I love

235
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:21,060
to sing I'm not very good at it but I

236
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:23,850
love singing I used to take guitar

237
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:26,490
lessons I wish I still had time to learn

238
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:28,770
all Olli asked what's the most difficult

239
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:30,180
part when you came to deciding doing

240
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,080
something you like instead of living a

241
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,640
secure life

242
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,250
the most difficult part I think was

243
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,590
probably telling my parents the second

244
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:40,380
hard realization that I had was that I

245
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:43,050
doubt myself a lot and that's something

246
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:45,060
that I struggle with quite a bit I have

247
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:46,279
so much support from the people around

248
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:49,040
my parents

249
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:50,810
my friend from you guys of course but

250
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,999
when it comes down to when I'm by myself

251
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:55,430
and when I'm alone I doubt myself a lot

252
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:57,709
I'm working on it it's really hard like

253
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:59,300
inner inner battles and stuff but leave

254
00:08:57,709 --> 00:09:01,759
also asked what was the biggest shock

255
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:03,800
you experienced after deciding to chase

256
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:05,660
after your dreams that was it the

257
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,639
biggest shock was me realizing like I

258
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:10,459
have support from so many people that I

259
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:12,350
love but I don't believe in myself this

260
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:14,629
is completely new territory to me and

261
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:16,009
I'm slowly like rediscovering the kind

262
00:09:14,629 --> 00:09:17,930
of person that I am and how I handle

263
00:09:16,009 --> 00:09:19,550
certain situations okay I feel like this

264
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:21,620
Q&A with super-long I don't even know

265
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:24,649
how many questions I've answered so far

266
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:26,749
but it's getting so hot and your device

267
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:28,790
I love dying so I saved my favorite

268
00:09:26,749 --> 00:09:29,600
questions for last because you saved the

269
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:31,370
best for last

270
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,100
duh and there be chance related

271
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:36,230
questions which I love to answer because

272
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,629
I love BTS I really do a couple of you

273
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:41,240
guys asked to draw bias and BTS my bias

274
00:09:38,629 --> 00:09:45,079
is jungkook he was my bias after I heard

275
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:48,470
him do covers of Adam livings lost stars

276
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:50,389
and Tori Kelly paper hearts and I love

277
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:52,850
the song so when I heard him do covers

278
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:55,879
of them I was like in love for sure the

279
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:57,559
sense that I really loved me I think he

280
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:59,990
was my bias wrecker as he slowly

281
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:02,149
becoming my bias or he already is my

282
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:03,379
bias I don't know they also asked

283
00:10:02,149 --> 00:10:06,110
favorite BTS Tara

284
00:10:03,379 --> 00:10:08,420
I'd have to say fire I loved the music

285
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:10,519
video for fire I loved the aesthetics I

286
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,839
love the style it's amazing it's very

287
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:14,480
fun and eclectic

288
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,850
favorites BTS song of course I love

289
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,160
their title songs their singles fire

290
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:20,540
blood sweat and tears save me I love

291
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,639
them but when it comes to like my

292
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:25,069
favorite favorite songs currently it has

293
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:26,360
to be autumn leaves and cypher three I

294
00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:28,430
love autumn leaves cuz it's very

295
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,620
emotional issues a really good song and

296
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:32,480
cypher 3 is a really fun badass song to

297
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,160
listen to right now I really love a lot

298
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,929
of their older stuff and they're sweeter

299
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,519
stuff their songs makes me really sad

300
00:10:35,929 --> 00:10:39,920
sometimes I've definitely gotten very

301
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:42,079
emotional listening to like whale Ian 52

302
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,209
I love that song but I also love them

303
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:47,240
more fun the cut of poppy songs like

304
00:10:44,209 --> 00:10:49,309
where you from coffee embarrass just one

305
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,379
day I remember Karen showing me dope and

306
00:10:49,309 --> 00:10:52,790
blood fun tears and I was like oh yeah

307
00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:54,209
they're really good but when I saw the

308
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:56,490
video for just one day and hurts

309
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:58,110
I was like enamoured I don't know why

310
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,759
but I love that song and it just stuck

311
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:01,589
with me that was my first favorite song

312
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:03,089
just one day so those are the questions

313
00:11:01,589 --> 00:11:04,740
