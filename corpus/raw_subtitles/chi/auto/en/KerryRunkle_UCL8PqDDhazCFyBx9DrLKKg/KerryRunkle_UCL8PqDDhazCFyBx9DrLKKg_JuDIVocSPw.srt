1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:04,589
I'd always get the questions like do you

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,779
ever want to meet your real parents do

3
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:09,000
you ever want to go back do you know how

4
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:40,530
to speak Chinese do you ever wonder if

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:41,730
you have siblings or not I'm freaking

6
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,410
out because I think I'm stressed out

7
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,370
about this video and I'm talking about a

8
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,230
lot of things that are kind of

9
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:47,730
controversial and just things that

10
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,559
sometimes people don't think about and

11
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,960
you want to make sure that you don't

12
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:54,600
portray it in the wrong light so and

13
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,390
also we got Cheerios and a low bun so

14
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,039
you know things are about to get real hi

15
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,050
everyone my name is Kari and welcome to

16
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,190
our YouTube channel today's video is

17
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,260
something that I've really been looking

18
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:05,909
forward to filming and playing that I've

19
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,890
been seeing going around on YouTube

20
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:09,450
growing up Asian growing up Asian

21
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,790
American let's talk about growing up

22
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,590
Asian American various titles and I'll

23
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,080
leave some of my favorite ones right

24
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,720
here and down below but I also wanted to

25
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,119
use this time as may is Asian Pacific

26
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,770
American Heritage Month I really wanted

27
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,470
to film this and get it out because it

28
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:27,330
is timely and also include what it's

29
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,610
like to be adopted I think that there's

30
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:32,310
a lot of amazing Asian American

31
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:34,590
youtubers way more than I ever saw

32
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:38,060
growing up I remember watching Close

33
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:41,640
Encounters genom and Michelle Phan and

34
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:43,680
Phan Michelle Phan and those were like

35
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,479
the only two and even then you know they

36
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,250
weren't as dark as me they had Asian

37
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:49,049
parents and I loved watching their

38
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,240
videos don't get me wrong but I think it

39
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:52,979
is important to share adoptee stories

40
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,920
because there is a lot that comes with

41
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:57,780
it so I think there are questions that

42
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,820
Asian Americans are asked all the time

43
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,219
you know like where are you really from

44
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:05,040
oh say something in Chinese Korean

45
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:06,960
Japanese and you're just like or they

46
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,569
like yell me how to you and you're just

47
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,160
like please stop but I am also here to

48
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:12,840
probe and answer question

49
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,760
based on my experience of people

50
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,610
frequently asking you ever want to meet

51
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:20,070
your real parents Oh like what time were

52
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:22,410
you born in Cary uh I don't know because

53
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:24,750
I don't know my real birthday so this

54
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:28,050
video goes in chronological order of my

55
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,850
life just to give context as to how

56
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,410
young I was and the challenges that I

57
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:33,510
was facing because I think that when you

58
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:35,550
are adopted when you're much younger you

59
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:37,920
don't really think about you know what

60
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,750
people say as much or you don't realize

61
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,940
how much it affects you until you're

62
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,710
older I also interviewed my friends in

63
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,570
my adoption group and the adoption group

64
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:48,750
is basically just a group of girls who

65
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:51,600
were also adopted from the same part of

66
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:54,030
China and live in the same geographical

67
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,890
area as me right now obviously some have

68
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,990
moved around but it's been amazing that

69
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:00,060
we can still stay in touch so there'll

70
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:01,470
be clips from them throughout this video

71
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,230
because I wanted to get their

72
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:05,880
perspective and see what it was like for

73
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:08,070
them also because obviously not

74
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,660
everyone's experiences are the same so

75
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:12,030
let me begin by saying that being

76
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:14,370
asian-american has its own complex

77
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:16,050
feelings and then being adopted has

78
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,060
difficult challenges and I'm still

79
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:20,550
definitely processing how I feel about a

80
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,050
lot of things I also don't want it to

81
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:23,940
come across that if you don't check

82
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:26,280
these boxes or you don't feel the same

83
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,900
way that I do or how my friends in my

84
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,550
adoption group feel then that

85
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,410
invalidates your feelings because it

86
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:33,120
absolutely does not everyone has

87
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:35,550
different experiences and ways of

88
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,590
processing with that this video was very

89
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:39,780
personal and vulnerable to film so I

90
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,310
hope you will enjoy and if you do be

91
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,530
sure to give this video a thumbs up

92
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:45,270
subscribe and let's get into the video

93
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:47,580
so I'm just gonna begin with some

94
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:49,590
background information basically I was

95
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,750
adopted from China when I was 14 months

96
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:53,070
old and the reason why I was adopted

97
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,970
mostly was because of the one-child

98
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:56,610
policy

99
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:59,040
in certain tik-tok right here it all

100
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:00,480
started my mom met my dad I don't know

101
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,600
if they were in love but then they had

102
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,130
me then China had a one-child policy and

103
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,770
they wanted a boy so they didn't want me

104
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:10,650
then I was left on the street and put up

105
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:13,140
for adoption then two white people from

106
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:15,630
America came and adopted me then two

107
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:18,570
years later we went back and adopted my

108
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:21,389
younger sister hi I'm Eleanor and my

109
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:23,520
life it's kind of crazy

110
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:26,099
also when my parents want to adopt me

111
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,930
they said that the local people living

112
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,849
in the village caught us when we were

113
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:31,110
babies they called us lucky babies my

114
00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:32,759
mom said that the translator made that

115
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,020
very clear wherever they went when they

116
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:36,120
were holding the babies they saw these

117
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,340
white people with these Asian babies

118
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,080
they called them lucky because I was

119
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,879
adopted when I was fourteen months old

120
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,400
the only thing that I remember has been

121
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:46,740
American influenced besides my godmother

122
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,479
who is Japanese she would make me congee

123
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:51,000
she would make me authentic Asian dishes

124
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,860
growing up because my stomach at that

125
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,780
time could not handle like McDonald's or

126
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,340
Burger King my parents told me that the

127
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,680
night that they got me in the hotel room

128
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,909
they got McDonald's and I threw up from

129
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,650
eating french fries because I wasn't

130
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:03,629
used to the grease so when they came

131
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:05,310
back they realized that Bonnie my

132
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:06,659
godmother knew how to cook dishes like

133
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:08,639
that and it was really comforting to

134
00:05:06,659 --> 00:05:10,860
have her in my life also being adopted

135
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,479
was never really in question because my

136
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,580
parents would read me childhood books

137
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,770
that had to do with adoption like a fox

138
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:19,490
would adopt a chicken and it would all

139
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,490
be good so

140
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:25,639
Cody you want my milk

141
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,920
[Applause]

142
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:34,540
[Music]

143
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:34,540
[Applause]

144
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,020
so elementary school was confusing as it

145
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,850
is for any kid but I think it was also

146
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:44,730
because I was in a predominately white

147
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:46,590
suburban area and I only had one other

148
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:47,910
Asian friend and she was Indonesian so

149
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:49,680
she really looked like me but

150
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,360
nonetheless I could definitely tell that

151
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,130
my white friends would get whatever they

152
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,960
wanted and for some reason I could just

153
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:57,090
tell that teachers would treat them

154
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,860
differently and I think that teachers

155
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:00,480
would have like microaggressions to me

156
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,790
like about being good at math or like

157
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:05,040
expecting things for me and I can't

158
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:06,840
pinpoint any specific examples but I

159
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,600
really do remember feeling a little bit

160
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,500
clouded at that time and not really

161
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,240
understanding what it meant to have a

162
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,830
different skin color or maybe have

163
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,390
smaller eyes and everyone else I know

164
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,980
that's not very helpful but I think that

165
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:18,960
when you're little as a kid you don't

166
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:20,610
think that much into things like that

167
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,380
and you may not realize how much of a

168
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:24,600
lasting impact they have on you when I

169
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:27,900
saw I think jazz you talked about this I

170
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,610
was like yes girl like oh my god when

171
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:32,460
you're little you want to wake up white

172
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:34,800
so badly like I subconsciously

173
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:36,660
definitely did and for the longest time

174
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,400
I thought that I was white like I

175
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:41,400
thought that I should be treated like I

176
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,110
had white skin blond hair like I have

177
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,880
these white parents my white brother

178
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:47,040
point is is that I would wake up and

179
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,870
want to be white which is so messed up

180
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,240
and this is embarrassing to say probably

181
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:53,190
like 7 years old I was like oh I have

182
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,290
blond hair like my parents are white I

183
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:58,770
have a white brother like why am I being

184
00:06:55,290 --> 00:07:01,080
treated differently like why do people

185
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:03,480
expect me to be good at these things

186
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,950
like X Y Z you know the classic like

187
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,110
Asian stereotypes and I did not

188
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:08,550
understand why it mattered so much if I

189
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,900
was different you know what I mean like

190
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:11,310
obviously I looked in the mirror and I

191
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,080
was like okay I don't really like look

192
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:14,820
like my parents but I didn't understand

193
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:17,580
the concept of race which really does

194
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:19,170
any like six 7 year old I don't know for

195
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:21,960
so long when I was a little I did not

196
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:24,210
want to resemble any Asian elements in

197
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,680
my life like I wanted to have big eyes I

198
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:28,110
want to tap curly hair I wanted to be

199
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,600
the exact opposite of what I was which

200
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:32,280
is so messed up and crazy to think about

201
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,920
that I wanted that I think it was also

202
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:37,230
because london tipton on suite life of

203
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,030
zack & cody we loved brenda song we do

204
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:40,650
but I think it was because her character

205
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:42,509
was portrayed as dumb she

206
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:44,699
was rich she didn't really have to think

207
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:47,970
for herself and she was so well liked

208
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:50,039
like she was still popular and whatever

209
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:52,110
but it's what you do when the only

210
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:53,610
person that you see on TV that kind of

211
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:56,729
looks like you and even then does it

212
00:07:53,610 --> 00:08:00,990
really is that so

213
00:07:56,729 --> 00:08:02,850
I feel awkward now again I don't want to

214
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:07,770
offend anyone this is just my personal

215
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:09,180
experience so we're gonna go on to still

216
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:12,930
elementary school because there's a lot

217
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:14,520
packed in in elementary school for

218
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:16,229
Chinese New Year my mom would bring in

219
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,840
clementines and traditional Chinese New

220
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:20,490
Year decorations and you know when

221
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,770
you're young and it's your birthday and

222
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:25,410
you get to go out and like deliver

223
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:26,910
cupcakes or whatever to teachers and

224
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:29,160
other friends in different classes

225
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:30,690
that's what I did but twice a year once

226
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,250
for my birthday and then once for

227
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:34,229
Chinese New Year's so I loved it I

228
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:36,180
really enjoyed this because I gotta have

229
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:37,440
a classroom number one but also I could

230
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:39,719
definitely see my mom trying to

231
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,430
integrate Chinese culture into my life

232
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:44,070
which I appreciate is like I said

233
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:45,779
adoption was not in question and yeah

234
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:48,120
like I said I didn't have a concept of

235
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:50,459
what I really look like but I knew that

236
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:55,440
I was adopted but I didn't I didn't

237
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:58,400
match up like I didn't match up being

238
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:02,540
adopted did not looking like my pair

239
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:05,100
this is so hard to talk about oh my god

240
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:07,320
they didn't put together that like being

241
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,910
adopted with my white parents who looked

242
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,240
like my other friend's parents and

243
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:14,310
everything I understand why me being

244
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,459
adopted from a different country would

245
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:20,970
result in other people expecting me to

246
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:24,120
have habits from somebody who grew up in

247
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:25,740
China I don't think that that's really a

248
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,779
crazy thought I don't know if that made

249
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,000
sense I hope it did we're just gonna go

250
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:31,980
on to the next point so kids are really

251
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,959
curious and I'd always get the questions

252
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:36,779
like do you ever want to meet your real

253
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:39,000
parents or your biological parents do

254
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:41,190
you ever want to go back do you know how

255
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,350
to speak Chinese do you ever wonder if

256
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:45,750
you have siblings or not these are all

257
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:47,640
valid questions I would say it's just

258
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:49,680
because of how frequently I got them

259
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,260
that when I grew up I was just like oh

260
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,800
my god like please stop asking me these

261
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,750
questions

262
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,880
between ons the first point and I don't

263
00:09:54,750 --> 00:10:00,029
want to get too dark but this is gonna

264
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:04,260
get a little dark does anyone know how

265
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:11,610
impossible it is to find two people that

266
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:14,550
are a still alive or two both know about

267
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:16,380
the pregnancy or three there's just one

268
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:18,149
point four billion people in China

269
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:20,339
I guess person was just really off put

270
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:22,860
it by this question because it felt like

271
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:24,959
people didn't see my parents my my

272
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,820
parents as my real parents when I did

273
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,620
and that's kind of all that matters and

274
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:30,570
I know that some adoptees have found

275
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,740
their birth parents and want to and

276
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:34,010
that's great and I know that there's a

277
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:37,020
bunch of technology like 23andme and

278
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:38,760
ancestry that you can go and find these

279
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:41,910
people or at least siblings or cousins

280
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:43,620
and that's great also at the same time I

281
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:48,300
had to think what that would do to my

282
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:49,920
parents um I think that they genuinely

283
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,589
would have supported me if I wanted to

284
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:55,380
find my birth parents but it's not like

285
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:56,610
they wouldn't be hurt and I don't think

286
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:59,610
that I would want to put myself through

287
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:01,320
that hurt or hurt them I know obviously

288
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:03,029
everyone's parents are different but I

289
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,000
think that when you go looking for your

290
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:08,399
biological parents at least in China you

291
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,760
have to be prepared for kind of more

292
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:15,180
dark morbid thoughts and I'm not saying

293
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,890
that for every person but I think that

294
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:20,610
you don't want to go in there and have

295
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:23,520
these ideas of what your parents were

296
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:26,490
like and then have that come crushing

297
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:29,670
down like not to be dramatic but I don't

298
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:32,130
think it's all roses and rainbows and I

299
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:36,240
think at least personally for me it's

300
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:40,230
not like something that I want to

301
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,970
explore and you guys like going through

302
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:44,190
that process for me it's just too much

303
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:50,130
and I'm happy with the life I live now

304
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:51,930
I'm grateful and uh I watched an

305
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:54,270
adoption documentary that my one friend

306
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:55,829
posted and I will link it down below but

307
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:56,940
it was really interesting to see and it

308
00:11:55,829 --> 00:11:59,520
was kind of the first thing that I've

309
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:01,560
seen about like adoption and you know

310
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,690
the effects of the one-child policy on

311
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,579
other people other than me or people in

312
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,270
my adoption group so I would definitely

313
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:19,770
link that

314
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:21,060
I feel the same like Naomi how you said

315
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:22,080
like when you get to the birthdays I was

316
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,430
like this probably isn't my real

317
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,230
birthday so why am i skipping the

318
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:27,450
birthday right now I just think about

319
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:29,490
like for weeks going on like this we're

320
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:32,300
out there at this coz so that gets me

321
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:34,740
the most cuz I don't know when it is a

322
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:37,290
conversation that's kind of hard to play

323
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:42,420
into as a kid is oh what time were you

324
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:44,490
born like I was born at 11:58 and 3/4 of

325
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:46,070
a second and I'm just like I don't

326
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:48,990
actually know when my real birthday is

327
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:51,600
well as adoptees the orphanage will

328
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:53,070
typically estimate when you are born but

329
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,410
you won't actually know your real

330
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:57,149
birthday and definitely not the time

331
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:58,860
that you were born that's just something

332
00:12:57,149 --> 00:13:01,589
that's like funny to me now and I think

333
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:03,779
that as a kid I felt ostracized I felt

334
00:13:01,589 --> 00:13:05,730
really left out by that but I think that

335
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:07,500
was just because I wanted to be like oh

336
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:09,390
yeah like I know what I was born at this

337
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,220
time I don't know about other people

338
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:13,470
watching this video but I think it's

339
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,149
definitely weird not to know that the

340
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:17,190
birthday on your birth certificate is

341
00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:20,160
not technically your birthday like it

342
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:23,490
could be off by a couple days or max

343
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:26,399
maybe a week but obviously the month and

344
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:29,130
everything are for the most part correct

345
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,660
but yeah you you could be celebrating

346
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:32,310
your birthday on the totally wrong day

347
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:34,440
you wouldn't know I remember growing up

348
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:36,329
I would ask my dad like if he thought

349
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,700
that my biological mom was thinking

350
00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:40,260
about me around April 11th and he said

351
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,240
oh she probably thinks about you all the

352
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:44,250
time and especially during that day I

353
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,660
think that got me down into a rabbit

354
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:47,610
hole of what-ifs and I started to like

355
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:50,070
paint a picture of what she was like

356
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:52,200
then even still to this day I don't get

357
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:53,760
as emo but I definitely get a little

358
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,589
weird during my birthday at least like a

359
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,480
week before leading up to it because

360
00:13:55,589 --> 00:13:59,010
there's no way that you're gonna stop

361
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,620
thinking about your biological parents

362
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:03,480
and I definitely don't think of them as

363
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:06,450
frequently as I did when I was growing

364
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,860
up but you still kind of wonder what

365
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:10,260
your life would be like and how crazy

366
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:11,940
your life worked out the way that it did

367
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,529
especially around your birthday

368
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:16,440
I feel like adoption is a lot about

369
00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:18,540
coming to terms with the unknown

370
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:21,120
and that's um so dramatic and not here

371
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:23,310
to like be like Oh like play the violin

372
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,230
for the adoption kids but I'm just like

373
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:28,319
I feel like I there has not been a voice

374
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:30,449
in the adoption community as much as I

375
00:14:28,319 --> 00:14:31,620
thought there would be or like growing

376
00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:33,949
up it wasn't like there was a lot of

377
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:36,389
people to look up to who were adopted so

378
00:14:33,949 --> 00:14:39,089
just know that it's okay to feel weird

379
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:41,220
for five days out of the 365 day

380
00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:50,550
calendar for your birthday if you're

381
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:53,569

382
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:53,569
we this thing

383
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:19,710
