1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,060
*groans* 

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,336
ah!

3
00:00:04,336 --> 00:00:06,976
 my microphones stand! 

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,922
hi it's annabelle

5
00:00:13,922 --> 00:00:17,440
it's nice to see you again, i can't wait to catch up through this q&a

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,044
um-- *stutters* *some gibberish*

7
00:00:21,044 --> 00:00:23,720
thank you to everybody who submitted questions.

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,606
also in the description, you can jump to specific questions or come back to them.

9
00:00:27,606 --> 00:00:34,349
i think the easiest thing to start off with- many people are excited to learn about bambi and prairie how they're doing.

10
00:00:34,349 --> 00:00:39,085
i expected that prairie would be very standoffish, i said give her a week.

11
00:00:39,085 --> 00:00:44,523
i think it really only took her four days? we were at lilith's for the first week

12
00:00:44,523 --> 00:00:52,687
when i had to organize my storage unit but i don't want to explain all of that process too in detail because the vlog is coming out next week

13
00:00:52,687 --> 00:00:54,256
show not tell, right?

14
00:00:54,256 --> 00:01:01,043
good news is after we settled into this new york space- three days or so, they were already playing, chasing each other,

15
00:01:01,043 --> 00:01:04,997
grooming each other, and i think like the only step left is for them to cuddle.

16
00:01:04,997 --> 00:01:10,082
i was a little bit worried whether or not they would feel disappointed or cabin fever from

17
00:01:10,082 --> 00:01:12,735
being in this studio apartment,

18
00:01:12,735 --> 00:01:14,975
bambi's been living in a two-bedroom--

19
00:01:14,975 --> 00:01:17,350
two-story house for a year

20
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:21,627
and even my sister's *apartment*

21
00:01:21,627 --> 00:01:29,180
is bigger. it's a huge downgrade but, i do keep in mind  just what i feel would be healthy.

22
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:33,157
i almost got another studio apartment with no view

23
00:01:33,157 --> 00:01:39,628
right off the bat, i just had a bad feeling about that place. my sister was just like "this jeopardizes cat vitality" or something like that

24
00:01:39,628 --> 00:01:43,808
maybe i can take them out on walks again but from experience,

25
00:01:43,808 --> 00:01:50,209
neither of them liked it very much. i don't think that the space is actually too small for the three of us here

26
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:56,968
because like they're two tiny cats and i make sure that there's plenty of perching spots for them whether it be like all over this couch,

27
00:01:56,968 --> 00:02:00,784
they have their own couch, they have the  castle, the table top and the bed

28
00:02:00,784 --> 00:02:03,050
and they love to switch out their resting spots,

29
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:07,569
and they kind of have like this routine. maybe i'll do a day in the life of prairie and bambi one day.

30
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:11,292
on to me: what am i most excited about living in new york?

31
00:02:11,292 --> 00:02:13,164
explore more of the city of course

32
00:02:13,164 --> 00:02:15,619
and to make new friends.

33
00:02:15,619 --> 00:02:20,170
i've been really anxious all my life when it comes to making friends

34
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:24,111
and i have a really.... great set of friends

35
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:24,720
how do i say that lol

36
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,021
we're not like in a big group or anything i have really strong one-on-one bonds

37
00:02:30,021 --> 00:02:33,460
but now that i'm an adult and self-employed it's just a lot harder to meet people right ?

38
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,621
one of the reasons why i wanted to move here is the culture

39
00:02:36,621 --> 00:02:42,560
and the arts scene and like maybe i could get  a studio residency and just be more hands-on  

40
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,328
yeah in terms of that living in new york...

41
00:02:45,328 --> 00:02:47,099
...um..eating

42
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:50,905
..and exploring cool- oh you know what haha

43
00:02:50,905 --> 00:02:55,415
..clubbing, i've never gone to a club or like even a party

44
00:02:55,415 --> 00:02:56,562
where i'm like *wooo*

45
00:02:56,562 --> 00:02:59,928
my sister has a lot more expertise than me so,

46
00:02:59,928 --> 00:03:02,115
luckily she doesn't live far,

47
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:09,864
just a train ride, she's gonna come over and in the uh... occasional nights where i don't sleep before 10.

48
00:03:09,864 --> 00:03:12,718
so i have to figure out how i'm going to-

49
00:03:12,718 --> 00:03:15,073
did i always know i was gonna come to new york?

50
00:03:15,073 --> 00:03:22,073
no there were maybe two or three times i was like hoping i can come to new york and even making plans or looking at apartments

51
00:03:22,073 --> 00:03:24,438
but it never even solidified

52
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,804
in the back of my mind i just sort of..

53
00:03:27,804 --> 00:03:34,485
if this dream was a balloon i just kind of let it go and watched it flow far away in the sky i was like, it's okay,

54
00:03:34,485 --> 00:03:36,375
it doesn't have to be my life

55
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,380
i'm proud of myself for being here.

56
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,134
i'm never bored.

57
00:03:40,134 --> 00:03:45,672
when i was reading the book flow they were kind of saying you don't want to be in a state of either boredom or anxiety,

58
00:03:45,672 --> 00:03:47,378
you want to find flow.

59
00:03:47,378 --> 00:03:55,307
i'm always on the anxiety side but occasionally, i do find that nice  flow and i enjoy my day when i plan it out nicely.

60
00:03:55,307 --> 00:03:59,382
do i miss home? i've not been here long enough to feel homesick

61
00:03:59,382 --> 00:04:08,134
i really enjoy the independence. i'm sure as time goes on i will begin to miss my family but now that i'm not in school, i....

62
00:04:08,134 --> 00:04:14,884
...okay i've been having extreme brain farts i don't know what happened here i meant to say, now that i'm out of school

63
00:04:14,884 --> 00:04:19,440
my schedule doesn't have to work around  going home only on holiday breaks which is nice

64
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,838
do i miss home?

65
00:04:22,838 --> 00:04:25,295
it definitely gets quiet sometimes at night,

66
00:04:25,295 --> 00:04:29,870
i kind of just get myself in a mood to really enjoy the evening and like

67
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:36,222
take it slow and stuff- i can make videos about this if you're interested.. in terms of just being homesick in general,

68
00:04:36,222 --> 00:04:43,066
i moved around so much growing up i never feel attached to any one place. i used to be a lot more attached to objects which

69
00:04:43,066 --> 00:04:46,000
has changed recently

70
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:54,409
but like i think what i have the hardest time letting go of are like 'memories of a time where things were once like this'

71
00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:56,381
and they would never be like that again.

72
00:04:56,381 --> 00:05:05,040
my yeye, which is my.. wait what- paternal grandfather and i had a really close relationship and he's

73
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,622
he passed away from cancer a long time ago

74
00:05:08,622 --> 00:05:14,008
i had some of the most happiest memories um of my life

75
00:05:14,008 --> 00:05:19,440
so i still ruminate on a lot of those memories it's like equal parts

76
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,296
sorrow and joy

77
00:05:23,296 --> 00:05:26,088
so here in new york do i feel free or released?

78
00:05:26,088 --> 00:05:31,577
the main difference is being able to do things by my own schedule,

79
00:05:31,577 --> 00:05:37,735
cooking my own meals, right like my grandma's not there to take care of me but at the same time i won't feel the pressure

80
00:05:37,735 --> 00:05:46,383
and the guilt to say, i need to eat dinner an hour later, like organize my time without needing to explain myself has definitely

81
00:05:46,383 --> 00:05:49,363
saved some mental energy but at the same time

82
00:05:49,363 --> 00:05:52,880
it was never too bad because living in my family house

83
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,186
it was really comfortable.

84
00:05:55,186 --> 00:05:59,884
the only huge difference is like the first time i went grocery shopping

85
00:05:59,884 --> 00:06:01,645
i was just like what the F--

86
00:06:01,645 --> 00:06:07,698
living at home for a year has like screwed me over because i completely forgot my meal plan,

87
00:06:07,698 --> 00:06:09,820
it's been a long time since i've shopped for myself.

88
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,925
i definitely don't think i'm gonna stay in new york forever,

89
00:06:12,925 --> 00:06:21,982
the way i eventually want to live my life maybe have like a little store or a cafe and have like a nice quiet home with my family

90
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:27,887
and i can't afford anywhere like near new york city i just don't think that's realistic here.

91
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:31,303
the worst parts of living alone?

92
00:06:31,303 --> 00:06:38,809
having to face the crises all by yourself. at  school, you know those nights where the cats would catch this mouse?

93
00:06:38,809 --> 00:06:42,449
maybe one was missing its head or  whatever? you know- you have to pick it up yourself!

94
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:51,432
so i've been paying for my own bills since i  moved out of my college dorms. the only main things i rely on my mom for is phone

95
00:06:51,432 --> 00:06:54,134
like we're still on a family phone plan.

96
00:06:54,134 --> 00:07:02,513
other responsibilities that i'm going to look into that i haven't previously done is like renters insurance, cat health insurance

97
00:07:02,513 --> 00:07:08,971
we don't have dental insurance so i'm going to have to go like... i have a cavity *cries*

98
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:11,682
poopy parts of being an adult of course but inevitable.

99
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:14,361
probably gonna have to spend 300 on that cavity..

100
00:07:14,361 --> 00:07:20,208
lilith doesn't live so far from me she's in rhode island still and she's gonna take the train in next week and i'm gonna see her,

101
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:25,319
so i'm excited. it kind of reminds me of the gilmore girls intro song

102
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:31,159
*all you have to do is call my name  and i'll be there on the next train*

103
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,560
~where you lead

104
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,692
i will follow~

105
00:07:37,692 --> 00:07:41,740
anywhere that you tell me to

106
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,706
i can go and visit hair and a train anytime

107
00:07:44,706 --> 00:07:50,798
so in terms of my current job uncertainty what the hell i'm doing, how many jobs am i juggling,

108
00:07:50,798 --> 00:07:55,186
so the main thing i'm doing is youtube full-time and my shop

109
00:07:55,186 --> 00:08:03,635
i would say i spend equal energy on both of those and then i run my patreon. i have like a little bit over 400 amazing patrons

110
00:08:03,635 --> 00:08:09,099
that have stuck with me even though i've been the most unproductive ass in the last three months

111
00:08:09,099 --> 00:08:15,301
in the beginning i was like overworking myself i don't know like just needing to prove something to myself i think

112
00:08:15,301 --> 00:08:19,584
do i fear the uncertainty of this self-employment? yes

113
00:08:19,584 --> 00:08:23,460
yes...every day

114
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,995
every waking moment??

115
00:08:25,995 --> 00:08:30,867
you know i haven't been as active on youtube- i appreciate when people say  they miss me on youtube

116
00:08:30,867 --> 00:08:35,527
because i'm just like.. it makes me realize that i used to be a lot more productive so

117
00:08:35,527 --> 00:08:46,300
as soon as i cover all my bases like make a nice spreadsheet of my financials, i want to make enough for savings, then we can talk about um like what do you call it like expendable income..

118
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:51,336
it's worth it for me. yes i can be saving like thousands of dollars by living at home

119
00:08:51,336 --> 00:08:55,260
but like not only is being in the suburbs just..

120
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,268
too.. it's like drying me out.

121
00:08:58,268 --> 00:09:00,499
full on spongebob in the spongebob movie.

122
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:04,508
bird needs to leave the nest as one of my friends put it

123
00:09:04,508 --> 00:09:11,042
and a viewer asked me a sort of personal question about if they should go into engineering because

124
00:09:11,042 --> 00:09:18,639
it ensures their livelihood in the future because if they instead major in their passion, which is literature

125
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:21,911
like maybe they would be unemployed and struggling

126
00:09:21,911 --> 00:09:27,550
i guess my advice would be ask yourself could you imagine yourself being happy doing engineering?

127
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:35,350
if you had to go into work five days a week probably for decades, doing this field- could you actually be happy with it

128
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:42,572
because if you're pretty content and you can get a stable livelihood then you can definitely take classes or go back to school

129
00:09:42,572 --> 00:09:52,016
for your passion but, if you just if you cannot like go on living like that which is kind of how i feel about why i needed to pursue art

130
00:09:52,016 --> 00:09:55,749
full-time even if it means like a life of uncertainty, like to me..

131
00:09:55,749 --> 00:10:03,336
that rigor is really worth it. but also if you want to get a degree in literature and you feel like you might not immediately find a job

132
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,968
related to your field, that's so normal.

133
00:10:05,968 --> 00:10:13,308
even people who graduate with stem backgrounds might end up somewhere not even in remotely related to their actual major

134
00:10:13,308 --> 00:10:18,974
if i were to get a stem job?? well i am very passionate about biology,

135
00:10:18,974 --> 00:10:21,347
i've always enjoyed biology.

136
00:10:21,347 --> 00:10:28,412
i used to think i would be great as a nurse i realize i'm kind of faint when it comes to thinking about like surgery or like injuries

137
00:10:28,412 --> 00:10:31,035
so i actually don't think i would be great..

138
00:10:31,035 --> 00:10:39,807
dream job? okay would be some sort of biologist and i get to go in the field to research marine biology or just ecosystems in general,

139
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:49,052
i've seen organizations that do rescue and animal rehabilitation or is that like a veterinarian field? or a mix of both?

140
00:10:49,052 --> 00:10:54,880
some of you might know that toby ran away  last month and that was really unexpected and

141
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:01,372
totally messed up my shop operations because i kind of just shut down for a few months-- *for a few days*

142
00:11:01,372 --> 00:11:03,021
*weep*

143
00:11:03,021 --> 00:11:09,942
and during those days one of the things i did was watch our planet on netflix and i've always loved animal documentaries

144
00:11:09,942 --> 00:11:11,285
and i really liked that one too

145
00:11:11,285 --> 00:11:18,344
i just never got the chance [to watch]. there were some scary parts like seeing an imbalanced ecosystem, way too many of like this

146
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:23,600
one species and how that affects other species it was super insightful and quite inspiring at the end

147
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,928
hmm..okay

148
00:11:28,928 --> 00:11:30,800
so how am i really?

149
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,421
i thought i would be a lot more concise when answering this question but, in general i'm doing..

150
00:11:35,421 --> 00:11:38,707
uh... like... i'm.......

151
00:11:38,707 --> 00:11:46,759
i just realized how much work i have to do on myself and it's cool. my mental health has been so bad for so long

152
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:48,356
i didn't even notice

153
00:11:48,356 --> 00:11:54,933
when you're not really thinking about it and you have coping mechanisms that act as crutches for you to be able to be

154
00:11:54,933 --> 00:12:00,567
high functioning at the things that you need to get by with..

155
00:12:00,567 --> 00:12:05,356
there's no more pretending-- admitting to myself hey i actually don't feel okay at all  about this, why do i think that?

156
00:12:05,356 --> 00:12:09,346
and unpacking it. i found pretty cool books that have been helpful,

157
00:12:09,346 --> 00:12:13,241
podcasts, but finally i i'm going back to therapy.

158
00:12:13,241 --> 00:12:16,630
yesterday i signed up for it. i'm trying a service i haven't done before,

159
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:23,893
so i'm still waiting to get matched to a specific counselor and start the session. i just hope that all around,

160
00:12:23,893 --> 00:12:27,980
my mental state will improve and that could impact my productivity,

161
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,767
how do you really expect anyone to be thriving with the year that we've had?

162
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:35,353
so i give myself a break in terms of that but like also

163
00:12:35,353 --> 00:12:38,758
hey, how can i make the best with what i'm given ?

164
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,208
that's sort of what i'm trying to do right now.

165
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:43,720
so i've been having a long art block for a long time!

166
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,040
and yes i question my abilities, "am i doing enough?"

167
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,641
am i as good as i think? or i just question that all the time.

168
00:12:51,641 --> 00:12:55,795
one of the ways to calm down a little bit is to get off social media.

169
00:12:55,795 --> 00:13:02,935
when you're on the explore page sometimes you find so many inspiring people and that fires you up and you want to paint!

170
00:13:02,935 --> 00:13:10,331
but other times it totally over stimulates me and i just get into this paralyzed like huhhh i can't do anything!

171
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:17,331
just a few decades ago we weren't exposed to so many hundreds and thousands of different people living different lives

172
00:13:17,331 --> 00:13:26,640
so in our head we kind of compartmentalize all of these internet strangers always thinking that other people are  

173
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,750
doing and being more productive than us,

174
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:35,679
that they're struggling less, thriving way more than us, and that we're falling behind.. seeing my peers,

175
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:42,278
sometimes i love seeing their illustrations sometimes it just makes me question myself feel like i'm getting nowhere.

176
00:13:42,278 --> 00:13:45,414
i DO feel like right now i'm nowhere,

177
00:13:45,414 --> 00:13:52,366
like as in i don't really know where i want to go my life??

178
00:13:52,366 --> 00:13:58,224
because in college i have this huge dream that was shattered.

179
00:13:58,224 --> 00:14:00,413
..like i became really disillusioned

180
00:14:00,413 --> 00:14:08,833
i started school wanting to do textiles for fashion and i wanted to do fashion because i was just one person and that person

181
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:12,142
just doesn't exist anymore like i'm not that person anymore

182
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:19,584
so it does make me question like do i want to even work for a fashion company ? because the person who wanted to work

183
00:14:19,584 --> 00:14:23,291
for a fashion company thought that her life was going to be like this..

184
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:30,960
i really want to work on illustration because see if i didn't do fashion and if i never pursued that career i would want to do

185
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,427
storytelling.. probably animation or write  graphic novels.

186
00:14:37,427 --> 00:14:40,317
my muse currently, they're my cats

187
00:14:40,317 --> 00:14:45,282
i'm freaking catcreature, i live with two of the most charming little things

188
00:14:45,282 --> 00:14:52,869
and i've been sketching my cats a lot and i'm-- prepare to see a lot of cat paintings! because i'm just like hey. i have an artist block.

189
00:14:52,869 --> 00:14:55,642
what do i do. i'm just gonna paint my cat like there's no tomorrow

190
00:14:55,642 --> 00:14:59,673
and maybe one day i will expand my visual  vocabulary.

191
00:14:59,673 --> 00:15:01,859
do i want to continue doing textiles, yes!

192
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:04,725
even if i don't want to do it on like a  corporate level,

193
00:15:04,725 --> 00:15:07,578
freaking textiles is like the most magical thing ever.

194
00:15:07,578 --> 00:15:12,240
if you learn the craft of textiles, whether it be weaving crocheting knitting,

195
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:20,720
dyeing, i would never regret having learned what i have learned and the appreciation for textiles  

196
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,600
i love it. i have a knitting machine i purchased from a friend that i haven't started using  

197
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,093
so expect some knitting struggles from me.

198
00:15:29,093 --> 00:15:31,520
sometimes to calm myself i think about

199
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,929
me as a 60 year old as an 80 year old,

200
00:15:34,929 --> 00:15:38,328
i'll probably be making art that speaks to me a lot more,

201
00:15:38,328 --> 00:15:46,092
time is just such a gift. every day is such a gift your health, your body is a gift. don't forget that don't let the fast-paced world,

202
00:15:46,092 --> 00:15:50,874
the consumer, capitalist world convince you that you're never enough or you'll never get there.

203
00:15:50,874 --> 00:15:56,346
not feeling as rushed and knowing like i have the time to get there someday even if it takes me decades,

204
00:15:56,346 --> 00:15:59,912
given that i will be blessed with a long life

205
00:15:59,912 --> 00:16:04,498
i hope to live into three digits-- given that the world is still around

206
00:16:04,498 --> 00:16:07,310
and not  burned to the ground by that time,

207
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:15,198
what will my art be then? so in that sense i'm not so worried about where i'm going and how many skills i will obtain

208
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:18,800
because every day is just a new opportunity 

209
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,074
to improve those skills, to learn more.

210
00:16:22,074 --> 00:16:24,679
lastly the miscellaneous stuff!

211
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:26,241
has my style changed?

212
00:16:26,241 --> 00:16:34,106
i'm kind of at this blank canvas point in my life where- you know my hair's grown out now, it's all natural

213
00:16:34,106 --> 00:16:38,223
the funniest thing is that i kind of miss  having damaged dyed hair

214
00:16:38,223 --> 00:16:46,211
because when it was kind of dry and crispy it had some texture.. i need some volume. you realize that my head is extra small

215
00:16:46,211 --> 00:16:50,288
when i was in middle school i had an inside joke with a guy who i called bigfoot.

216
00:16:50,288 --> 00:16:52,989
right before puberty his feet started growing faster than the rest of his body

217
00:16:52,989 --> 00:16:56,584
so i called him bigfoot every time i saw him he called me small head

218
00:16:56,584 --> 00:16:58,503
we'll be like bigfoot! small head~

219
00:16:58,503 --> 00:17:03,466
so i'm excited i think i'm reinventing myself, definitely want to make a glow up video,

220
00:17:03,466 --> 00:17:10,531
i really enjoy watching those, as well as transformation videos, i still haven't transformed myself into my high school self..

221
00:17:10,531 --> 00:17:16,907
i saw uh some footage and i was like- i was sexy when i was a minor?? look at me now.

222
00:17:16,907 --> 00:17:17,971
i like your hair!

223
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:20,333
i quite enjoy how my dark hair looks.

224
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:22,880
the last time i had long black hair was when i was 15

225
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,002
so it's been a long time.

226
00:17:26,002 --> 00:17:27,133
i might as well try.

227
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:29,123
try to see if i can grow it out and..

228
00:17:29,123 --> 00:17:36,666
before, i had a lot of it thinned out due to the trendy layer cut at the time, everyone was getting their tips thinned out so

229
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:43,798
i want to see how nice and thick my hair might look like. hopefully it won't be too flat and maybe i can even donate my hair

230
00:17:43,798 --> 00:17:46,303
if i could resist myself from dyeing it..

231
00:17:46,303 --> 00:17:46,803
we'll see.

232
00:17:46,803 --> 00:17:50,294
lastly i just want to talk about music for one hot second

233
00:17:50,294 --> 00:17:51,728
what's my favorite song of the moment?

234
00:17:51,728 --> 00:17:55,365
okay so in the last couple months,

235
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:57,585
i really fell in love with joji.

236
00:17:57,585 --> 00:17:59,920
sad songs about love...

237
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,492
yeah. i i really enjoyed joji's albums,

238
00:18:03,492 --> 00:18:04,640
i can't remember the name of it was it..

239
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,280
broadcast? like the album name..  i like nectar, i have that one  

240
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:14,183
slow dancing in the dark, which is the most famous track.

241
00:18:14,183 --> 00:18:16,820
i also love clairo a lot.

242
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,597
immunity is wonderful but her ep,

243
00:18:19,597 --> 00:18:23,600
uh- favorite song from her is hello? that song just makes me wanna go like:

244
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,508
play the song to me dancing just now.

245
00:18:27,508 --> 00:18:30,182
what was my favorite song from lana del rey's new album?

246
00:18:30,182 --> 00:18:33,833
i actually just listened to it for the first time  this morning.

247
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:42,254
i didn't like it as much as i thought it would. however, i find that all lana songs i have to listen to it a lot and it will grow on me

248
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:49,527
and then i'll become obsessed with it like exactly a year and a half after the release date. a lot of the songs seem super similar

249
00:18:49,527 --> 00:18:55,020
whereas i feel like in her previous albums they all had their own story

250
00:18:55,020 --> 00:19:00,910
whereas this one was like the whole album  was a continuous song in a way with different chapters..

251
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:07,360
so my favorite song as of now is probably 'not all those who wander lost' or 'yosemite'

252
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,279
and again this is gonna change

253
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:16,461
because from norman fcking rockwell, my favorite song was cherry- wait.

254
00:19:16,461 --> 00:19:20,372
was bartender, and then now...

255
00:19:20,372 --> 00:19:24,899
it's probably mariner's apartment complex for sure.

256
00:19:24,899 --> 00:19:26,480
those are all the questions for today,

257
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,976
it's getting hot and i don't shave my pits.

258
00:19:28,976 --> 00:19:34,475
i had fun catching up with you. thank you for keeping me company! i feel a lot better because with this last week,

259
00:19:34,475 --> 00:19:36,023
i've just been...

260
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,842
with everything that's going on in current events,

261
00:19:38,842 --> 00:19:41,076
i want to talk about a fundraiser that i'm doing.

262
00:19:41,076 --> 00:19:50,241
the link is right there in the description and  just by announcing it on instagram in the last day we've raised 1500$ which is incredible

263
00:19:50,241 --> 00:19:53,750
i made this nice painting of bambi sleeping,

264
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:59,569
need a little bit of peace and calm.. one winner is gonna be drawn in a week. it's open worldwide the shipping is included

265
00:19:59,569 --> 00:20:06,600
so in order to enter, it's five dollars minimum to purchase an entry ticket

266
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,688
or you can share it on a social platform i think

267
00:20:09,688 --> 00:20:16,835
for one free entry and the drawing would be generated on better world the organization

268
00:20:16,835 --> 00:20:24,886
100% of profits are going to be donated to the asian american pacific islander community relief fund

269
00:20:24,886 --> 00:20:29,091
so i hope that doing this video would notify some people who don't follow me on instagram.

270
00:20:29,091 --> 00:20:33,838
also if you are not interested in getting this painting because you just don't like it

271
00:20:33,838 --> 00:20:41,282
you can also donate to other organizations  and gofundmes of members of the AAPI community, so you don't have to actually

272
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:44,605
use my fundraiser but i just wanted to let you know that's happening

273
00:20:44,605 --> 00:20:51,735
and yeah i'll see you pretty soon. next week is gonna be the moving vlog. until then take care goodbye!

274
00:20:51,735 --> 00:20:56,407
bambi doesn't normally chill over here by the toaster,

275
00:20:56,407 --> 00:21:02,160
i just put him there because i almost filmed the video with that backdrop

276
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,920
this cat tree.. *grunts*

277
00:21:07,054 --> 00:21:11,039
belongs..*big lift* over here.
