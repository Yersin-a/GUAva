29
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,140

00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,720
every aspect of a Gemini is me: like talking too much,

35
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:42,059
That's basically it favorite music genre. I don't really know I know which ones. I don't like I don't really like Pop music

36
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:47,100
I'm not the biggest country music fans, but I like you know alternative kind of Indie stuff

37
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,839
You know get the like hipsters well um who is your favorite musician?

38
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:57,419
So I like a bunch of different musicians like if you're talking about like I like 50s music

39
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,750
I like 70s and 80s music so like with 50s

40
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,619
I like Doris Day and Bobby Vinton when it comes to 70s and 80s music

41
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:09,208
I like Elton John the beatles like I don't even know like like a bunch of different stuff

42
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:16,789
But like recent artists like new or artists I like real-estate beach house Matt Demarco Love Matt Marco, Taemin Paula

The strokes let me go to my spotify right now two L's later sweet foxes two door cinema club vampire weekend

44
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:30,348
I like Beach fossils okay. I like a lot of artists, but those are just a few of them favorite food

45
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:37,279
Honestly it kind of changes all the time. I do really love sushi, but I'm vegetarian so like veggie sushi. Yeah

46
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,869
I'm like a fake sushi fans, but whatever I like to smoothies favorite drink, okay?

47
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,900
three number one

48
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,780
My strawberry Smoothie that I make that's just strawberries lemon juice and water and then blend it up

49
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,939
And it turns into a slushie really good another thing I like

50
00:02:49,939 --> 00:02:53,239
It's sparkling water with lime squeezed into it really good

51
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:57,949
Then last not least my favorite drink of all time iced almond milk latte

52
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:03,918
It's not decaf tea cap is for weenies. No skidding subject, okay favorite Snack I?

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,469
Feel like I eat a bunch of small Snacks throughout the day like I never eat like a big meal

54
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:15,918
I just eat snacks honestly. I like to drink like my favorite snack is those strawberry smoothies that I drink where's just strawberries?

55
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,209
Lemon in water really good favorite holiday. I like Christmas

56
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:22,519
Because I'm basic

57
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:27,948
I mean like I don't know every other holiday just seems to be like not as awesome as Christmas the best vibes

58
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:32,599
The most like I don't know I slept that time of the year Christmas favorite Pastime I

59
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:36,889
Like I mean you know exercising taking that

60
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,689
editing videos filming videos taking more naps

61
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:46,459
So yeah, my main form of pastime is like doing videos right now and go to the gym

62
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,109
Favorite sport probably to my favorites I did competitive cheer which I think is a sport some people

63
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:54,829
You know don't come at me, but like I think cheers the sport when it's competitive

64
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:58,879
And so probably that or track because I did track

65
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,179
This year at school, and I really liked it. What is something?

66
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,949
You are talented at personally

67
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:10,219
I don't like this question because like I don't know like I don't really know if I'm talented at anything because like you're your own

68
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:13,578
Worst Critic so like I kind of think I suck at everything

69
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:18,380
But like that's kind of human nature so I don't know when I'm talented at honestly. I don't have an answer for that

70
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:22,159
What is something you wish you were talented at I mean I wish I was talented everything

71
00:04:22,159 --> 00:04:25,269
I wish I was a good saying. I wish I was like a good dancer

72
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:28,419
I wish that I was I don't know I wish I was good at a lot of things

73
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,449
I wish I was like a really fast runner. I don't know I wish I was

74
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,719
talented that everything honestly are you competitive Ii

75
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:41,439
It like depends like I can be super competitive in certain situations where I just like need to win, but then other times

76
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,480
I'm like it. I don't really mind moving so it's like it's kind of in between describe yourself in a single sentence

77
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,230
Oh my God. This is getting really hard um. I don't I don't know how to like put it new sens

78
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:54,039
I think I'm like pretty hard working and like you know like if I get my head, okay

79
00:04:54,040 --> 00:05:00,010
just mechanism it if I like get set on something like I will not stop till I like get that thing and

80
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,840
That's a sense about me. What is the best compliment you ever received?

81
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:09,279
I think whatever people say like I'm a really like nice person or my kind person or people say that to me

82
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:11,770
That's like probably the nicest compliment

83
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:16,749
I could get because it's something I like strive to do is like be a kind person and be nice or whatever

84
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,920
So when people say that I?

85
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:24,939
Succeed at that it really makes me super happy so probably that what are some of your bad habits

86
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,929
Probably like overthinking a lot. I definitely think about things like way too much

87
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:34,390
I overanalyze every single situation ever that's probably probably um favourite things about yourself

88
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:39,219
I would say is like what I said earlier how I like don't stop until I like succeed at whatever

89
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,940
I wanted to see that and

90
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,520
Obviously sometimes I don't succeed

91
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:47,259
But if I like reach the end or like I push myself to like the highest

92
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:53,559
Point that was like successful point. I can get to probably that what is on the top of your bucket list honestly

93
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,780
I don't really have like specific things on my bucket list

94
00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:00,340
But I know for sure I want to I definitely want to travel more

95
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,230
I mean, that's like a really like cliche answer

96
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:08,409
But like go outside of the country or maybe go to like I don't know bali looks really cool kind of Wanna

97
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:15,189
Go there like just like really like unique places. Just like explore more you know three long-term goals honestly

98
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,480
I would just say like overall

99
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,059
I'm not even going to say three because I only have one just like

100
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,630
Wherever I'm at in my life at any point be like really

101
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:28,540
Happy and like just genuinely happy whether that means like whatever that means in the other

102
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,880
Aspects of my life like I don't care about that

103
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,879
I don't care what I end up doing is that except just overall being happy and also really cliche, but like

104
00:06:37,579 --> 00:06:42,129
The truth three short-term global we're not that short-term that would probably mean today

105
00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:48,308
And that would mean try to not take it off and then try to not drink more than three coffees within one hour

106
00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:50,889
It's hard, and I don't know if I'm gonna succeed

107
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:54,219
But I think that I might be able to so I'll let you know

108
00:06:54,349 --> 00:06:57,069
What are you doing today to accomplish those goals well?

109
00:06:57,069 --> 00:07:02,858
I haven't done anything for either of those today taking a nap wise it is currently 12 p.m.

110
00:07:02,859 --> 00:07:09,189
And I have not taken a nap yet. So we are going strong in that aspect the coffee thing. I already had two today, so

111
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:15,789
I'm not doing so well on that one, but I think I think if I really control myself

112
00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:22,088
And I can wait another like 20 minutes. I might be able to only have one more coffee today. So we'll see

113
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:23,899
What is your biggest accomplishment?

114
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:30,159
becoming more confident and happy and summing that sexuality a big accomplishment although starting a YouTube channel because I always wanted to and

115
00:07:31,249 --> 00:07:34,539
It was kind of an interesting story about how it happened, so one day

116
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:37,328
I will do a story time and tell you why I started youtube because it's actually really interesting

117
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:43,359
But I had a channel a long time ago like in like fourth grade, and I did like outfits on there

118
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,329
And it was like horrible, and I can't find those videos anymore

119
00:07:47,059 --> 00:07:49,298
Luckily like literally, thank God. They were so embarrassing

120
00:07:49,299 --> 00:07:54,939
But I'm probably also like starting a youtube again because I always wanted to and now I'm doing it. So that's cool

121
00:07:55,149 --> 00:08:00,609
What didn't I feel first date for you? Okay? Well? I don't go on dates very often

122
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,689
Sadly

123
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:07,028
This is also kind of cliche. I don't like things like going to the movies. I don't like things like a dinner

124
00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:11,828
Because I just like really boring to me like just so like awkward well with a movie

125
00:08:11,829 --> 00:08:15,549
It's just awkward because you can't talk and it's just weird and then do you like went to dinner?

126
00:08:15,549 --> 00:08:19,508
You're like Force like look at the other person in the face, and then they have to watch you eat

127
00:08:19,509 --> 00:08:24,759
I don't know do something about that's just too boring um something like really fun like in adventure like

128
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:30,999
Driving somewhere kind of far away like driving to the beach or something like swimming in the ocean at like 2:00 a.m.

129
00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:33,969
Or something okay? That's actually good. Not really fun something like that

130
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:39,308
It would be like really memorable and like special so what is something you look for in a partner

131
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:44,229
I'm 16 and I have basically no experience in this topic

132
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:49,910
But I would say just like somebody who is like willing to put in people effort into the relationship

133
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:55,700
But also like somebody who you can trust in like the trust is mutual so like you're not worried about like where they are all

134
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,950
the time or who they're talking to or whatever like

135
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:03,709
Somebody like trust me enough that like I could like hang out with another guy friend and like the guy wouldn't care you know also

136
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:08,840
Just somebody who's like genuinely kind and like thoughtful of me and my feelings because I'm like emo

137
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:15,379
I'm kidding um but like yes, so he's like really like considers your feelings. I'm bad at this stuff. Who is your role model?

138
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:19,489
I would say like definitely my parents. I mean for sure like that's an obvious one

139
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:24,020
I was something like a really inspirational person is like Casey nice - a youtuber. He's a great person

140
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,210
I don't know. He's really inspirational to me which one of your parents

141
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,410
Are you more like depends like really similar to my dad because we like the same music

142
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:33,050
We like doing the same things he has a Youtube channel, too

143
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,290
We both like to like go

144
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:38,059
Like explore in the City and like you know I get coffee and stuff except

145
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:43,130
I think we have a lot of like I also think I'm aligned with my mom because you know we both like enjoy it sort

146
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:46,880
Of women parts of like life like shopping and like stuff like that

147
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,140
So it kind of depends which one of your parents are you closest to this is also kind of like

148
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:56,960
I don't have one or the other I'm close with both equally in like different ways because I'm an only child

149
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,739
Only children get really close with their parents so both honestly

150
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:06,920
What is the last book you read um I don't read like I genuinely do not read ever because I hate it

151
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:12,139
I don't know why I just don't like reading unless I find like a really really good book that I like really love I

152
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:17,180
Just don't read so I don't have an answer for that. What is your favorite fairy tale?

153
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,240
pfft

154
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,360
I don't freaking know like I ever like what what even is a fairy tale like I mean I know but like I know I don't

155
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:23,750
Have an answer

156
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:29,510
What is your favorite quote I hate reading quotes out loud like something about that is so corny to me

157
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,150
But let me look at my pinterest on my quote board

158
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:35,569
And I'll just read one that I find how the keep it simple good things are coming

159
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:42,139
That's a good one remember that kids keep doing that good mindset. You know favorite subject in school probably science

160
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,140
It's the most interesting to me

161
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:52,250
It's also one of the hardest classes in school for me, but I do enjoy science so probably that I like biology more than chemistry

162
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:55,010
definitely subject you were best at

163
00:10:55,110 --> 00:11:00,290
Honestly like depends because like I don't think I'm very like it depends on like if you mean like which I personally think I

164
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,570
strive at or like which one has a better grade like that's just different, but like I think I'm

165
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:10,069
Okay, at like history and stuff like that, but I absolutely hate it

166
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:15,079
So it's like I dunno like I'm probably better at history and English, than I am at like math and science

167
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,080
But like I enjoy math and science more

168
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:22,160
Don't ask me why favorite teacher honestly? I don't have an answer

169
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,610
I liked all of my teachers in Elementary school and the second I got to high school

170
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,060
the relationships

171
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,340
Weren't as good in high school, and I'm still in high school

172
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:40,040
Yeah, it's just a lot more on the line a lot more tension. So that's that. Who has left the biggest impact on your life?

173
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,640
probably my parents because

174
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,970
They've always been there my whole entire life

175
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:50,869
So there's really nobody else in this entire universe who could have more of an impact on me than my parents because I've been around

176
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:54,260
Them my whole life, and I'm an only child and they're like the biggest influence on me

177
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:59,600
What app do you use most? Probably Instagram or Visco. What piece of technology could you not live without?

178
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:05,900
Honestly, I don't just have one. Phone, laptop very important, and camera also very important

179
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:11,269
But if for some reason I couldn't have a camera the phone as the camera so probably phoned and laptop. What countries

180
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:16,429
Have you visited well I've been out of the country twice. I went to Ireland and then I went to the Dominican Republic

181
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:19,249
What countries would you LIKE to visit? If it was up to me,

182
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:25,640
I would visit every country in the entire universe... so... Most embarrassing memory? Oh my God, okay

183
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:30,920
This is really good. So basically like I did cello in fifth grade um which is weird considering

184
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:36,679
I literally four foot six inches and probably weighed 50 pounds and was basically the size of a cello

185
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,760
But anyway

186
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,319
it was the end of the school year and we had like our last recital thing, parents were there

187
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:47,060
Grandparents were there uncles, aunts, everybody you can think of was there. The crowd was going

188
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:55,840
Wild when we finally finished our fifth grade orchestra performance and all of us sucked. We probably sounded like actual crap considering

189
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:57,560
we were literally fifth graders and

190
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:00,559
Barely had brains developed yet, just kidding that's not true

191
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:07,580
But you know what I mean um anyway, so obviously it at the end of the year they gave out awards for people who are really outstanding

192
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:12,380
So I was sitting there in my chair. You know I wasn't expecting to get an award

193
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,960
because well I

194
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:21,679
just didn't play like I literally move my fingers and just like lightly put my bow the bow I'll insert a

195
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,450
Bow across like the thing I wouldn't even make any noise with my actual cello

196
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:29,809
I would just kind of like fake it the whole time, so I wasn't really expecting

197
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:36,859
An award because I really didn't deserve it basically I heard our conductor guy say like "all

198
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:41,689
Of the people who play cello stand up." That's why I heard in my brain, okay?

199
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:48,380
I don't know why I've heard this because that is not what he said he said "blank name stand up"

200
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:53,030
I thought he said "all the people who play cello stand up," but it turned out. He said like

201
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:58,920
This cello player stand up, and it said her name, and then she stood up well, I stood up with her

202
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,200
But I didn't win the award tho

203
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:06,660
[Emma displays an uncomfortable amount of awkward silence as she remembers her sense of embarrasment that day]

204
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:13,650
Okay, moving on. How many relationships have you been in? haha ONE in Fifth grade

205
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:17,720
so but I mean I guess in you're 16 you don't need to be in a relationship, so I guess it's fine, but I'm

206
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,410
No, I'm just kidding. I'm good. Single life is the best life, ya know?

207
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:26,929
If you could give your younger self any advice, what would it be? You will never regret being kind

208
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:32,569
one thing that you know now that you wish you would have known as a kid that's like the same question and

209
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,650
I'll say it again. You will never regret being kind

210
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,700
ever

211
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,170
Okay

212
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:45,439
Like I just remember how me and everybody was in Middle school to each other and it was just the norm you know

213
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:52,279
Second grade self girl would steal your sticker and talk about a freaking fight and like at this point in my life

214
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:58,309
I've learned you know just be the bigger person always be kind no matter what anybody says or does to you being kind you will

215
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:02,210
Never regret it okay. Tea, or coffee? Okay coffee. I'm sorry

216
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:05,420
That's just like not even a question. I don't even

217
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,900
Like that we don't even need to discuss it okay coffee

218
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:17,210
How tall are you I am five three and a half but I think I'm 5'4 now soooo I don't know. Cats or dogs? um

219
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:22,639
Dogs, I mean, I don't know I just like dogs better. Sorry. All you cat people, no hate

220
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:29,210
I have cats and dogs so like yeah, but dogs are just better. I feel like everybody who doesn't like dogs doesn't have one

221
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:37,039
So like that's the answer to that. Funniest moment throughout school? Honestly I feel like all moments in school are absolute hell

222
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:42,650
Rather than anything funny. I usually am not laughing during school, I'm usually crying

223
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:49,699
Hysterically constantly because of how much I actually despise being there if I think of one later, I'll let you know

224
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,640
But like for right now all my memories are just absolute terror

225
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:58,789
Are you in slash have you gone to college? I am going to be a junior next year stone, no

226
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:03,830
What was your worst subject in high school um while I'm in high school now and worse subject honestly

227
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,650
I think my least favorite would have to be English

228
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,600
I just think it's so boring

229
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,400
But I think the one that I was like the worst outlet had the worst grade was probably like chemistry

230
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,720
But like I actually really liked chemistry so it's kind of like a love-hate favorite animal, okay?

231
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,269
I really I really like all animals

232
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:26,569
I think it's easier to say the ones that I don't like I have a actual phobia like no joke dead-ass phobia of

233
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:30,619
Caterpillars I hate them, but I don't even like I don't care about snakes

234
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:35,479
I spiders or if you like if they're near me, I freaked out, but is there like 10 feet away from me

235
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,940
I don't care um like I'm cool. Doll that

236
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,760
Caterpillars just

237
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:47,510
Really make me lose it like I just I can't if they're near me if I see a picture of one like I will

238
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:52,700
Initiate I don't know I don't know it's mental. What sports do you play? So have you played well earlier?

239
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:59,059
I mentioned that I did cheer and track, but I also did okay. This is going to take a while. I did karate

240
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:05,989
Taekwondo when I was like six so that happened, so I did ice skating I did gymnastics I did

241
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:12,739
I never did any like ball sports. I can ever do softball or soccer. I never did any of that, and then I did cheerleading

242
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:17,060
Competitively, then I also did in high school two year for like a half of a year

243
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:22,399
And then I did cross-country for one year, and then I did track for one year

244
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,759
And I did both of those track and cross-Country slash your favorites book

245
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:30,079
Oh, I don't really have one, but I did really like okay

246
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,750
I don't know if anybody remembers these books, but it was like

247
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:36,349
I need to look up the title you'll have em like literally myself so that I can find it, okay

248
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:39,199
I finally found it, so I'll insert a picture here, but it was this series

249
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,410
And it's like if you're reading this it's too late and no not talking about the drake album cover

250
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:48,149
I'm talking about these books, and I was like younger when I read them, but like no joke if I read them today

251
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:54,120
I would still enjoy them because they were so good like I don't know why they're like teen books

252
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:59,430
But they're so good like I I need to read them again because I haven't read them since like seventh grade

253
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:05,159
but They were like my favorite books read like no joke it would be like a 500 page book and I would go through it in

254
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:10,050
Like no joke three days and like it's I like reading if I find a book I like it's that

255
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:13,169
I don't like that many books. I don't care how old you are I don't care

256
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:17,970
How just you get when you're like you know 17 looking in the preteen book section

257
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:23,819
I don't care these books are so good. No matter what your age is who are some of your favorite youtubers, okay this um

What is your favorite movie one Napoleon Dynamite watched it 100 times great?

00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,950
Don't get it look I love that movie

00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:46,139
And I all forever loved that movie and if it creeps you out you need to man up because that's a great athlete okay next

Love that movie as well super just aesthetically well done last but not least I loved the walls and gromit movie

279
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:59,060
You know they're not only movies are kind of like episodes, but like I kind of consider them movies single or taken

280
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,970
taken obviously, I'm single I'm

281
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,690
Very very single, okay, the only twins if you're watching me

282
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,459
Do you speak any difference in any different languages and how well well?

283
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:18,110
I speak español um a little bit because you know with last year took Spanish too, so I can say like the basic stuff like

284
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,840
See hola Como estas

285
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,310
you know

286
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:28,639
Do you have any siblings no and that explains a lot doesn't it how would you describe your fashion sense?

287
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:34,939
It's like a combination of just like random. It's so random it just changes all the time like I love accessorizing

288
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:39,050
Okay, whatever I like to be like effortless. I guess like it's not really ever listed

289
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,850
Just like I don't like to wear a lot of makeup

290
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:42,890
That's just economic that I don't like to do a lot of my hair

291
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:47,869
I don't like to like do a lot of extra stuff. I just like to do what comes natural to me statement restaurant

292
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:55,130
I like Asian box. I don't know if they have them everywhere, but Asian box is really good favorite TV shows right now

293
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:58,579
I'm watching the office. I also watched pretty little liars for a little bit

294
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,580
I didn't think that I was going to stop

295
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:07,670
But it just everybody everybody else always says like we all just kind of drop like flies because it went too long

296
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:13,490
Like it just kept going and like I just couldn't watch it anymore PC or Mac Mac all the way. I'm sorry

297
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:15,350
I've never had a PC in my life

298
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:20,180
And I never ever will and honestly if I do like come to my house and slap me

299
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:23,810

I've grown up with apple like when I was a wee little tot

301
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:31,939
Like I little ipods were coming out and we were just growing up together hand in hand like

308
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,650
Would be oh, I already went over that question

309
00:21:55,290 --> 00:22:01,819
Okay, because like I basically what I did was I went combined to so like this is the most random amount of questions and stuff

310
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,960
And there's like repeats because I combined two tags together because I didn't feel like

311
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:08,460

00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:13,279
