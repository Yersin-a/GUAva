00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,500

strawberries lemon in water really good

88
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:23,269
favorite holiday I like Christmas

89
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:25,040
because I'm basic I mean like I don't

90
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:27,500
know every other holiday just seems to

91
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,510
be like not as awesome as Christmas the

92
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,010
best vibes the most like I don't know I

93
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:34,790
slept that time of the year Christmas

94
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:39,109
favorite pastime I like I mean you know

95
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:42,349
exercising taking that editing videos

96
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:44,209
filming videos taking more naps so yeah

97
00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:46,459
my main form of pastime is like doing

98
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:48,680
videos right now and go to the gym

99
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:50,209
favorite sport probably to my favorites

100
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,430
I did competitive cheer which i think is

101
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:54,290
a sport some people you know don't come

102
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:56,359
at me but like I think cheers the sport

103
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:59,900
when it's competitive and so probably

104
00:03:56,359 --> 00:04:01,609
that or track because I did track this

105
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,379
year at school and I really liked it

106
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:04,759
what is something you are talented at

107
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:06,769
personally I don't like this question

108
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:08,689
because like I don't know like I don't

109
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:10,909
really know if I'm talented at anything

110
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:13,489
because like you're your own worst

111
00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:15,109
critic so like I kind of think I suck at

112
00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:17,030
everything but like that's kind of human

113
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:18,320
nature so I don't know when I'm talented

114
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:19,940
at honestly I don't have an answer for

115
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,409
that what is something you wish you were

116
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:23,260
talented at I mean I wish I was talented

117
00:04:21,409 --> 00:04:25,810
everything I wish I was a good saying

118
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,790
I wish I was like a good dancer I wish

119
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,900
that I was I don't know I wish I was

120
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:31,030
good at a lot of things I wish I was

121
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,250
like a really fast runner I don't know I

122
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:35,800
wish I was talented that everything

123
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:37,780
honestly are you competitive II it like

124
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,400
depends like I can be super competitive

125
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,710
in certain situations where I just like

126
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,450
need to win but then other times I'm

127
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:44,230
like it I don't really mind moving so

128
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,480
it's like it's kind of in between

129
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:48,130
describe yourself in a single sentence

130
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,900
oh my god this is getting really hard um

131
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:51,460
I don't I don't know how to like put it

132
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,350
new Sens I think I'm like pretty hard

133
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:55,510
working and like you know like if I get

134
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:57,820
my head okay just mechanism it if I like

135
00:04:55,510 --> 00:05:00,120
get set on something like I will not

136
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:03,580
stop till I like get that thing and

137
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,020
that's a sense about me what is the best

138
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,610
compliment you ever received

139
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,140
I think whatever people say like I'm a

140
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,790
really like nice person or my kind

141
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:11,890
person or people say that to me that's

142
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:13,210
like probably the nicest compliment I

143
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:15,580
could get because it's something I like

144
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:17,860
strive to do is like be a kind person

145
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:20,770
and be nice or whatever so when people

146
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:23,170
say that I succeed at that it really

147
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:25,090
makes me super happy so probably that

148
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:26,800
what are some of your bad habits

149
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,630
probably like overthinking a lot I

150
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,490
definitely think about things like way

151
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,300
too much I overanalyze every single

152
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:33,880
situation ever

153
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,770
that's probably probably um favourite

154
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,090
things about yourself I would say is

155
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:39,100
like what I said earlier how I like

156
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:40,440
don't stop until I like succeed at

157
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:43,000
whatever I wanted to see that and

158
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:45,790
obviously sometimes I don't succeed but

159
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,130
if I like reach the end or like I push

160
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:49,750
myself to like the highest point that

161
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:52,150
was like successful point I can get to

162
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:54,250
probably that what is on the top of your

163
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,780
bucket list honestly I don't really have

164
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:59,230
like specific things on my bucket list

165
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:00,820
but I know for sure I want to I

166
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:02,230
definitely want to travel more I mean

167
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:04,060
that's like a really like cliche answer

168
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:07,210
but like go outside of the country or

169
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:09,250
maybe go to like I don't know Bali looks

170
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:11,230
really cool kind of wanna go there like

171
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:13,240
just like really like unique places just

172
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:15,760
like explore more you know three

173
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,410
long-term goals honestly I would just

174
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,910
say like overall I'm not even going to

175
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:21,280
say three because I only have one just

176
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:24,820
like wherever I'm at in my life at any

177
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,350
point be like really happy and like just

178
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:29,440
genuinely happy whether that means like

179
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:30,880
whatever that means in the other aspects

180
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,520
of my life like I don't care about that

181
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,559
I don't care what I end up doing is that

182
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,589
except just overall being happy and

183
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:40,479
also really cliche but like the truth

184
00:06:38,589 --> 00:06:41,829
three short-term global we're not that

185
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,899
short-term that would probably mean

186
00:06:41,829 --> 00:06:45,729
today and that would mean try to not

187
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:48,479
take it off and then try to not drink

188
00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:50,679
more than three coffees within one hour

189
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,689
it's hard and I don't know if I'm gonna

190
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:54,999
succeed but I think that I might be able

191
00:06:52,689 --> 00:06:56,409
to so I'll let you know what are you

192
00:06:54,999 --> 00:06:58,869
doing today to accomplish those goals

193
00:06:56,409 --> 00:07:01,509
well I haven't done anything for either

194
00:06:58,869 --> 00:07:04,029
of those today taking a nap wise it is

195
00:07:01,509 --> 00:07:05,799
currently 12 p.m. and I have not taken a

196
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:07,719
nap yet so we are going strong in that

197
00:07:05,799 --> 00:07:11,919
aspect the coffee thing I already had

198
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:15,099
two today so I'm not doing so well on

199
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,659
that one but I think I think if I really

200
00:07:15,099 --> 00:07:20,109
control myself and I can wait another

201
00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:22,089
like 20 minutes I might be able to only

202
00:07:20,109 --> 00:07:23,399
have one more coffee today so we'll see

203
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:25,599
what is your biggest accomplishment

204
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:26,589
becoming more confident and happy and

205
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,059
summing that sexuality a big

206
00:07:26,589 --> 00:07:29,679
accomplishment although starting a

207
00:07:28,059 --> 00:07:32,559
YouTube channel because I always wanted

208
00:07:29,679 --> 00:07:34,569
to and it was kind of an interesting

209
00:07:32,559 --> 00:07:35,799
story about how it happened so one day I

210
00:07:34,569 --> 00:07:36,999
will do a story time and tell you why I

211
00:07:35,799 --> 00:07:38,889
started YouTube because it's actually

212
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:41,649
really interesting but I had a channel a

213
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:43,689
long time ago like in like fourth grade

214
00:07:41,649 --> 00:07:45,819
and I did like outfits on there and it

215
00:07:43,689 --> 00:07:48,069
was like horrible and I can't find those

216
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:49,719
videos anymore luckily like literally

217
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:51,279
thank God they were so embarrassing but

218
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,899
I'm probably also like starting a

219
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:55,149
YouTube again because I always wanted to

220
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:57,309
and now I'm doing it so that's cool

221
00:07:55,149 --> 00:08:00,899
what didn't I feel first date for you

222
00:07:57,309 --> 00:08:04,359
okay well I don't go on dates very often

223
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:05,499
sadly this is also kind of cliche I

224
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:07,229
don't like things like going to the

225
00:08:05,499 --> 00:08:09,519
movies I don't like things like a dinner

226
00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:11,409
because I just like really boring to me

227
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:12,729
like just so like awkward well with a

228
00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:14,529
movie it's just awkward because you

229
00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:16,209
can't talk and it's just weird and then

230
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:18,009
do you like went to dinner you're like

231
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:19,329
force like look at the other person in

232
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:20,859
the face and then they have to watch you

233
00:08:19,329 --> 00:08:22,569
eat I don't know do something about

234
00:08:20,859 --> 00:08:25,019
that's just too boring um something like

235
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:27,399
really fun like in adventure like

236
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:28,809
driving somewhere kind of far away like

237
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:30,999
driving to the beach or something like

238
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:32,559
swimming in the ocean at like 2:00 a.m.

239
00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:34,389
or something okay that's actually good

240
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,949
not really fun something like that it

241
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:38,649
would be like really memorable and like

242
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:41,709
special so what is something you look

243
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:44,229
for in a partner I'm 16 and I have

244
00:08:41,709 --> 00:08:46,569
basically no experience in this topic

245
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:48,710
but I would say just like somebody who

246
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:50,570
is like willing to put in

247
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:52,490
people effort into the relationship but

248
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:53,930
also like somebody who you can trust in

249
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,490
like the trust is mutual so like you're

250
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,960
not worried about like where they are

251
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:59,480
all the time or who they're talking to

252
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,860
or whatever like somebody like trust me

253
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,600
enough that like I could like hang out

254
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:03,890
with another guy friend and like the guy

255
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,810
wouldn't care you know also just

256
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:07,640
somebody who's like genuinely kind and

257
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:10,760
like thoughtful of me and my feelings

258
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:12,230
because I'm like emo I'm kidding um but

259
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,910
like yes so he's like really like

260
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:16,010
considers your feelings I'm bad at this

261
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:18,470
stuff who is your role model I would say

262
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:19,970
like definitely my parents I mean for

263
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,990
sure like that's an obvious one I was

264
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:23,240
something like a really inspirational

265
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:24,590
person is like Casey nice - a youtuber

266
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,000
he's a great person I don't know he's

267
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:28,070
really inspirational to me which one of

268
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,870
your parents are you more like depends

269
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:31,490
like really similar to my dad because we

270
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:33,080
like the same music we like doing the

271
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:35,630
same things he has a YouTube channel too

272
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:37,370
we both like to like go like explore in

273
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:39,110
the city and like you know I get coffee

274
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:40,550
and stuff except I think we have a lot

275
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:42,680
of like I also think I'm aligned with my

276
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:45,320
mom because you know we both like enjoy

277
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:47,510
it sort of women parts of like life like

278
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,950
shopping and like stuff like that so it

279
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:50,780
kind of depends which one of your

280
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:52,850
parents are you closest to this is also

281
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:54,920
kind of like I don't have one or the

282
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:56,840
other I'm close with both equally in

283
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,320
like different ways because I'm an only

284
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,640
child

285
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,010
only children get really close with

286
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,470
their parents so both honestly what is

287
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:05,540
the last book you read um I don't read

288
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:07,610
like I genuinely do not read ever

289
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:09,410
because I hate it I don't know why I

290
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:11,000
just don't like reading and let them

291
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:13,790
find like a really really good book that

292
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,160
I like really love I just don't read so

293
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:19,160
I don't have an answer for that what is

294
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,290
your favorite fairy tale I help freaking

295
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,700
know like I ever like what what even is

296
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:24,260
a fairy tale like I mean I know but like

297
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,360
I know I don't have an answer what is

298
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:28,460
your favorite quote I hate reading

299
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,530
quotes out loud like something about

300
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:32,450
that is so corny to me but let me look

301
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:33,980
at my Pinterest on my quote board and

302
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:35,650
I'll just read one that I find how the

303
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:37,250
keep it simple good things are coming

304
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:39,020
that's a good one

305
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:40,670
remember that kids keep doing that good

306
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:42,890
mindset you know favorite subject in

307
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:46,040
school probably science it's the most

308
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:48,050
interesting to me it's also one of the

309
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:50,600
hardest classes in school for me but I

310
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:53,510
do enjoy science so probably that I like

311
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,880
biology more than chemistry definitely

312
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:57,260
subject you were best at honestly like

313
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,730
depends because like I don't think I'm

314
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:00,860
very like it depends on like if you mean

315
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:01,520
like which I personally think I strive

316
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,980
at or like

317
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:06,920
which one has a better grade like that's

318
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:08,900
just different but like I think I'm okay

319
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:11,150
like history and stuff like that but I

320
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,800
absolutely hate it so it's like I

321
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:14,630
vennett like I'm probably better at

322
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,220
history in English so I am it like math

323
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:18,560
and science but like I enjoy math and

324
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:21,500
science more don't ask me why

325
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,990
favorite teacher honestly I don't have

326
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,490
an answer I liked all of my teachers in

327
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:30,680
elementary school in the second I got to

328
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:32,210
high school the relationships weren't as

329
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,910
good in high school and I'm still in

330
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:37,910
high school yeah it's just a lot more on

331
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:39,920
the line a lot more tension so that's

332
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:43,760
that we look the biggest impact on your

333
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,810
life probably my parents because they've

334
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,610
always been there my whole entire life

335
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:48,440
so there's really nobody else in this

336
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:50,000
entire universe who could have more of

337
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,470
an impact on me than my parents because

338
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,940
I've been around them my whole life

339
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:55,160
and I'm an only child and they're like

340
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:57,710
the biggest influence on me what do you

341
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,390
use most probably Instagram or visco

342
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,810
what these are technology could you not

343
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,580
live without

344
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:04,910
honestly I don't just have one phone

345
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:07,310
laptop very important and camera also

346
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:09,170
very important but if for some reason I

347
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:10,880
couldn't have a camera the phone as the

348
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:12,680
camera so probably phoned in laptop what

349
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,720
countries have you visited well I've

350
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:16,400
been out of the country twice I went to

351
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,810
Ireland and then I went to the Dominican

352
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,580
Republic what countries would you like

353
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:21,110
to visit if it was up to me I would

354
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,980
visit every country in the entire

355
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:25,400
universe

356
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:26,990
so most embarrassing memory oh my god

357
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:30,110
okay this is really good so basically

358
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:32,030
like I did cello in fifth grade um which

359
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:34,400
is weird considering I literally four

360
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:36,440
foot six inches and probably weighed 50

361
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,870
pounds and was basically the size of a

362
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,370
cello but anyway it was the end of the

363
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:42,320
school year and we had like our last

364
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:44,060
recital saying parents were their

365
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,040
grandparents were their uncles off

366
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:49,400
everybody you can think of was there the

367
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:51,380
crowd was going wild when we finally

368
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:53,690
finished our fifth grade Orchestra

369
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:55,310
performance and all of us sucks we

370
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,690
probably sounded like actual crafts

371
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:59,270
considering we were literally just dry

372
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:01,130
turned and barely had brains developed

373
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:03,800
yet just kidding that's not true but you

374
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:06,140
don't mean um anyway so obviously it at

375
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,690
the end of the year they gave out awards

376
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:10,640
for people who are really outstanding so

377
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:12,460
I was sitting there in my chair you know

378
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:15,200
I wasn't expecting to get an award

379
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:16,940
because well I

380
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,220
just didn't play like I literally move

381
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:23,210
my fingers and just like lightly put my

382
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:25,160
bow the bow I'll insert a bow across

383
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:26,900
like the thing I wouldn't even make any

384
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,400
noise with my actual cello I would just

385
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:31,310
kind of like fake it the whole time

386
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:33,020
so I wasn't really expecting an award

387
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:36,380
because I really didn't deserve it

388
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:38,870
basically I heard our conductor guy say

389
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:41,270
like all of the people who play cello

390
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:43,280
stand up that's why I heard in my brain

391
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:45,860
okay I don't know why I've heard this

392
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:49,490
because that is not what he said he said

393
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:51,680
blank name stand up I thought he said

394
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:54,050
all the people who play cello stand up

395
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,300
but it turned out he said like this

396
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:58,130
cello player stand up and it said her

397
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,870
name and then she stood up well I'd sit

398
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:08,540
up with her but I didn't win me Awards

399
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:13,150
oh okay moving on how many relationships

400
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:15,590
have you been in haha one in fifth grade

401
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:16,820
so but I mean I guess in you're 16 you

402
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:19,490
don't need to be in a relationship so I

403
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:21,170
guess it's fine but I'm no I'm just

404
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:22,580
getting good I'm good single life is the

405
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:23,960
best life you know if you could give

406
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,320
your younger self any advice what would

407
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:28,460
it be

408
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,990
you will never regret being kind one

409
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:31,460
thing that you know now that you wish

410
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:33,800
you would have known as a kid that's

411
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:36,700
like the same question and I'll say it

412
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:42,350
again you will never regret being kind

413
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:43,850
ever okay like I just remember how me

414
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:45,350
and everybody was in middle school to

415
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:47,540
each other and it was just the norm you

416
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:50,090
know second grade self girl would steal

417
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:52,280
your sticker and talk about a freaking

418
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:54,200
fight and like at this point in my life

419
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:56,270
I've learned you know just be the bigger

420
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:58,220
person always be kind no matter what

421
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,970
anybody says it up to you being kind you

422
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:02,350
will never regret it

423
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:05,120
okay tea or coffee okay coffee I'm sorry

424
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:07,460
that's just like not even a question I

425
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:11,150
don't even like that we don't even need

426
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:13,400
to discuss it okay coffee how tall are

427
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:16,130
you I am five three and a half but I

428
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:19,820
think I'm 5'4 now so I don't know cats

429
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:21,740
or dogs um dogs I mean I don't know I

430
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:24,380
just like dogs better sorry I'll do cat

431
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:26,780
people know hey I have cats and dogs so

432
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:28,880
like yeah but dog alert is better don't

433
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:31,940
everybody who doesn't like dogs doesn't

434
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:34,160
on one so like that's the answer to that

435
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:35,810
funniest moment throughout school on

436
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:39,260
stage like all moments in school are

437
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:41,780
absolute hell rather than anything funny

438
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:44,960
I usually am NOT laughing during 12

439
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:47,150
usually crying hysterically constantly

440
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:49,430
because of how much I actually despise

441
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:50,780
being there if I think of one later I'll

442
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:53,750
let you know but like for right now all

443
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:56,150
my memories are just absolute terror are

444
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:58,550
you in slash have you gone to college I

445
00:15:56,150 --> 00:16:00,770
am going to be a junior next year stone

446
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:02,210
no what was your worst subject in high

447
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:04,310
school um while I'm in high school now

448
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:06,650
and worse subject honestly I think my

449
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:09,740
least favorite would have to be English

450
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:11,360
I just think it's so boring but I think

451
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,890
the one that I was like the worst outlet

452
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,360
had the worst grade was probably like

453
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:15,800
chemistry but like I actually really

454
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,260
liked chemistry so it's kind of like a

455
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:21,170
love-hate favorite animal okay I really

456
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:22,580
I really like all animals I think it's

457
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:25,640
easier to say the ones that I don't like

458
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:28,310
I have a actual phobia like no joke

459
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:30,140
dead-ass phobia of caterpillars I hate

460
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:32,630
them but I don't even like I don't care

461
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:34,370
about snakes I spiders or if you like if

462
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:35,540
they're near me I freaked out but is

463
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,900
there like 10 feet away from me I don't

464
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:39,260
care

465
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:44,000
um like I'm cool doll that caterpillars

466
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:46,160
just really make me lose it like I just

467
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,950
I can't if they're near me if I see a

468
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,510
picture of one like I will initiate I

469
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:52,220
don't know I don't know it's mental what

470
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,510

cheer and track but I also did okay this

473
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:02,300

475
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:08,449

but they ever did like just I'm just

542
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:29,730
letting you know like I love I'm over a

543
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,100
rant over what is your favorite movie

544
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:34,710
one Napoleon Dynamite watched it 100

545
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:36,180
times great solid best movie ever I love

546
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:39,300
it too Coraline if you don't like

547
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:41,250
Coraline I'm sorry but I just I don't

548
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:42,630
get it look I love that movie and I all

549
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,320
forever loved that movie and if it

550
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:44,790
creeps you out

551
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,320
you need to man up because that's a

552
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:48,210
great athlete okay next

553
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,740
remember I've came - great movie love

554
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:51,840
that movie as well super just

555
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:54,380
aesthetically well done last but not

556
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,970
least I loved the walls and gromit movie

557
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,440
you know they're not only movies are

558
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:59,200
kind of like episodes but like I kind of

559
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:03,290
consider them movies single or taken

560
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,310
taken obviously I'm single I'm very very

561
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:06,500
single okay

562
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:08,000
the only twins if you're watching me do

563
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,490
you speak any difference in any

564
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,520
different languages and how well well I

565
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:15,890
speak español um a little bit because

566
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,340
you know with last year took Spanish too

567
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:23,960
so I can say like the basic stuff like

568
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:24,680
see hola como estas you know do you have

569
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,780
any siblings

570
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,430
no and that explains a lot doesn't it

571
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:30,830
how would you describe your fashion

572
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:33,140
sense it's like a combination of just

573
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:34,400
like random it's so random it just

574
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:36,440
changes all the time like I love

575
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,270
accessorizing okay whatever I like to be

576
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,950
like effortless I guess like it's not

577
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,850
really ever listed just like I don't

578
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:42,080
like to wear a lot of makeup

579
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:43,430
that's just economic that I don't like

580
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,470
to do a lot of my hair I don't like to

581
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:47,420
like do a lot of extra stuff I just like

582
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:50,270
to do what comes natural to me statement

583
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:52,310
restaurant I like Asian box I don't know

584
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:54,740
if they have them everywhere but Asian

585
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:56,600
box is really good favorite TV shows

586
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:58,460
right now I'm watching the office I also

587
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,110
watched Pretty Little Liars for a little

588
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:02,990
bit I didn't think that I was going to

589
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:05,030
stop but it just everybody everybody

590
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:07,340

591
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:10,700
of drop like flies because it went too

592
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:12,260

593
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:14,420
just couldn't watch it anymore PC or Mac

594
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:17,300
Mac all the way I'm sorry I've never had

595
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:19,520
a PC in my life and I never ever will

596
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:21,350

600
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:30,080
when I was a wee little tot like I

601
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,370

everything I can possible to be just

609
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:49,070
like her last question of this entire

610
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:50,210
video honestly this is so long like I

611
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:51,710
don't even know if my computer's gonna

00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:54,230
have space for all this one of my bad

613
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:56,360
habits would be oh I already went over

614
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:58,100
that question okay because like I

615
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:00,410
basically what I did was I went combined

616
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:02,000
to so like this is the most random

617
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:03,350
amount of questions and stuff and

618
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,810
there's like repeats because I combined

619
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:08,240
two tags together because I didn't feel

620
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:10,880
like just 30 questions with

621
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,470
