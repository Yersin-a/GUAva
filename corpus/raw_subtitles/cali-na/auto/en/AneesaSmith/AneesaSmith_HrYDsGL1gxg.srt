13
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:30,840
questions that you want answers to on my

14
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,949
Instagram last night so this video is

15
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,469
going to be answering all of those

16
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:36,540
questions so without further ado first

17
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:39,989
question is what is my skincare routine

18
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,730
um well I don't have a skincare routine

19
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:44,550
I know that sounds bad this skincare

20
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:48,000
routine that I have had doesn't consist

21
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:49,829
of a whole lot I use a just like a mild

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,840
cleanser I believe it's from clean and

23
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:53,969
clear it's like the yellow and purple

24
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,770
bottle just a really mild cleanser but

25
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,289
still like gets all of that gunk off my

26
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,750
face I usually do I wash my face like

27
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:02,280
double I wash my face like every night

28
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,229
obviously when I'm taking a shower I

29
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,030
wash it once rinse and then wash it

30
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:07,860
again and rinse because there's still so

31
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,260
much makeup on my face usually at the

32
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,390
end of the day um I don't go like full

33
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,830
glam makeup look every single day

34
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,350
because homegirl and got no time for

35
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:18,030
that but when I do take off my makeup I

36
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,380
find that like just rinsing one time

37
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,610
isn't enough but you do have to be

38
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,799
careful because some of the cleansers

39
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,630
are really really harsh on the skin I've

40
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,450
used a couple wide used one from like

41
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,100
Neutrogena which was super good and like

42
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,900
cleansed in my skin really well but it

43
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,700
was so drying that I had to stop using

44
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,250
it and I also had a reaction to it so

45
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,869
that was just a bad experience but yeah

46
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,689
I don't really have a skincare routine I

47
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:42,090
just use like a mild cleanser I get

48
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:44,310
facials every now and then and then I

49
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:46,439
also will like spot treat my skin

50
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,140
whenever like my skin just recently has

51
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:51,090
not been well at all I hardly have any

52
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,290
makeup on today and I'm also so pale

53
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,970
okay let's just talk about that for a

54
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:56,579
second I literally look like a ghost

55
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:59,040
okay but yeah I do spot treat my skin

56
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:01,439
where I have breakouts I use the Mario

57
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,790
Badescu which is like the most popular I

58
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,070
feel like spot treatment

59
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,079
it's from Ulta at $17 it's in a little

60
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:09,509
tiny little pink bottle I use that

61
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:11,430
overnight if I ever have any like skin

62
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:11,840
breakouts that are coming through or

63
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,640
that I

64
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,620
you want to get rid of in a timely

65
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,920
manner so yes that is my skincare

66
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:21,349
routine okay next question is what

67
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,090
message would you give to a new makeup

68
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,720
artist coming into the industry that's a

69
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,430
good question

70
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,620
my message to a new makeup artist would

71
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:30,200
probably have to be trying it as much

72
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:32,209
practice as you can I know just from

73
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:35,090
like when I started I started working on

74
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:37,220
all my really good friends and I thought

75
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:39,920
like wow I'm so good at this like this

76
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:41,450
is honestly fire right now if I go back

77
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,940
now and I look at those pictures and I'm

78
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:47,030
like why did anybody let me touch their

79
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:49,160
face ever like why but I think my advice

80
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:51,829
would just to be get as much would be

81
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:53,450
just to get what did I say would be just

82
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:55,640
to get as much practice as you can

83
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:57,110
because practice really does make

84
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,730
perfect I know that's such a cheesy line

85
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,079
but the more practice you have the more

86
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:02,360
experience you have working on multiple

87
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:04,790
faces multiple skin tones multiple skin

88
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,680
types like all of that really helps you

89
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:08,000
in the long run because I mean if you're

90
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,099
a makeup artist and you want to like be

91
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,049
doing you know weddings or parties or

92
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:14,180
events or whatever it is you're more

93
00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:15,680
than likely gonna be working on so many

94
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:19,040
different faces and so many different

95
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,959
types of women that you know they're not

96
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,940
all one person is the same obviously so

97
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,500
I think just my biggest thing if you're

98
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:26,090
just starting out or you want to like

99
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,560
become a makeup artist is to get as much

100
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:28,880
practice as you can even though you're

101
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,709
probably gonna suck when you first start

102
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:33,079
that's totally fine because everybody

103
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:34,280
does I did I've always been into makeup

104
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,810
I've always been into beauty but when I

105
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,430
started doing makeup on other people I

106
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:38,870
was like what the hell am i doing like I

107
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:41,060
had no clue what I was doing and I just

108
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:43,160
had to learn from like experience so

109
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:45,319
game is not just an experience as you

110
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:47,359
can okay next question is what is your

111
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:51,019
favorite place to buy clothes honestly

112
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:53,810
honestly forever21 I know that's like so

113
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:55,849
basic and I feel like everybody shops

114
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:57,169
there but they had really cute clothes

115
00:03:55,849 --> 00:03:58,970
for me I'm not really super

116
00:03:57,169 --> 00:04:00,260
materialistic like I don't I don't know

117
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:02,030
mean that in a bad way I just mean like

118
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:04,040
I don't necessarily need like brand-name

119
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:07,130
stuff like I don't I'm just not that

120
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,959
kind of person I love just finding cute

121
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:10,609
affordable clothes where it doesn't like

122
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,319
break the bank you know ii mean and i am

123
00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:14,060
one of the people i love shopping like

124
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,519
shopping could be a full-time job for me

125
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:18,829
because i do it so often but i feel like

126
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:20,780
i want to be able to buy new clothes

127
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:22,250
often and not feel like well i'm

128
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:24,050
spending three hundred and fifty dollars

129
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,500
every time i go to the mall every time i

130
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,820
go shop

131
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,740
you know and I feel like forever 21 has

132
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:29,720
really really really cute stuff at a

133
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:32,540
really good price point so I usually buy

134
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,670
all of my clothes there I also do a lot

135
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:38,300
of shopping at Ross and Marshalls and TJ

136
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:39,560
Maxx stores like that and I feel like I

137
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,850
feel like they have like a bat you know

138
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,830
what I mean they were like oh you shop

139
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,880
at Ross like this yeah I do got my Ross

140
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:45,560
because they have a really cute stuff

141
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,150
and most the time I'm wearing stuff on

142
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,260
camera or like in a video or whatever

143
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:50,630
and you guys like oh my gosh where'd you

144
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:52,520
get that and I'm like Ross so they just

145
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:53,900
have really good stuff and also at a

146
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,640
very good price line in my opinion but

147
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:58,340
my I think my all-time favorite store is

148
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:00,770
forever 21 next question what is the

149
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:03,580
most important thing that you look for

150
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:06,440
on a client before doing their makeup um

151
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:08,660
that's a good one I think the one thing

152
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,970
that I look at like first and foremost

153
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:13,340
is their skin type because most the time

154
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:15,380
like if they have like dry skin I like

155
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:17,510
to prep the skin I always start with eye

156
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:18,980
makeup so no matter who I'm working on I

157
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,900
always do their eyes first because I

158
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:22,490
like to avoid like fall out if I'm doing

159
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,050
like a dark look or whatever but I

160
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,760
always look at the person's skin because

161
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:27,410
if they have dry skin I like to prep it

162
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,360
before so I'll put a moisturizer let

163
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:31,190
that kind of sink and soak in I'll put a

164
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,560
primer let that kind of like work its

165
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:35,630
way work itself in there and then by the

166
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,890
time I get to their face their face like

167
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:38,360
prepped and primed and ready to go if

168
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:40,640
that makes sense so I think definitely

169
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,770
looking at the person's skin is the

170
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,630
first thing that I do okay this person

171
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:46,250
asked what is your eyebrow routine your

172
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:48,680
yours always look amazing

173
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:50,120
so I actually get a lot of questions

174
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,440
about my eyebrows and I don't know if

175
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,840
I've said this on my channel before or

176
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,460
not but I used to have and let's just

177
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,350
okay we can just like I think you can

178
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:59,510
same I know I have a hat on but I used

179
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:01,250
to have a unibrow when I was little yes

180
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:03,080
I know I'm just letting it all out right

181
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:05,060
now also if you look on my Instagram

182
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:08,300
page I think it's kind of a bit farther

183
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:10,370
down but I did this whole post about

184
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:13,190
like my eyebrow transformation 30 years

185
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:15,110
they were so hideous like I had full

186
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:16,729
really really really full eyebrows and

187
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:18,380
then I plucked them and cut them and

188
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:19,970
trimmed them and they were lines I

189
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,800
basically did everything that you're not

190
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:23,240
supposed to do to my own eyebrows and I

191
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,580
thought they looked so good I just

192
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,110
didn't want to have a unibrow anymore so

193
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:29,390
I just tried everything I possibly could

194
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:31,160
to get rid of them but now they have

195
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:34,550
obviously grown back and they're not

196
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:37,640
lying face but I get them to get the

197
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,990
shape of my eyebrows I did threading so

198
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,400
I got I went to like one of those little

199
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:41,930
threading places and got the shape and

200
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,550
they I feel like the threading places

201
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,480
like shape them really well I don't I

202
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,850
couldn't tell you the name of the place

203
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,710
I went to is out of my bird now I pretty

204
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:50,600
much keep them up on my own every now

205
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:52,280
and then I will get them waxed just like

206
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,170
really get a nice cleaning but for the

207
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,090
most part I use those little like tinkle

208
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:58,250
twinkle razor things I think they're

209
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:59,180
called tinkle tinkle that sounds weird

210
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,500
but I'm pretty sure they're called

211
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,210
tinkle razors and they're just like they

212
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,010
kind of like will clean up your eyebrows

213
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:05,420
like your eyebrow hairs and stuff and

214
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:08,360
then I just pluck the ones that are like

215
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:10,310
too hard to get with that but um yeah I

216
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,560
just I have a really the girl who does

217
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:14,330
my eyebrows her name is Olivia I will

218
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,340
leave her contact information in the

219
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:17,840
description box below but she does a

220
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:20,060
really good job she's a really good job

221
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,860
shaping them and just like filling them

222
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,550
in and like making them like the shape

223
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,740
that I want

224
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:26,120
so I mean definitely having a good eye

225
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:28,760
brow specialist

226
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:31,220
is good but um as far as filling them in

227
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:34,010
I usually just use like a pencil I will

228
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:36,020
fill in like the sparse areas and then

229
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:38,450
I'll go in with a powder and just like

230
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:40,370
fill in with a powder so that's what I

231
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:42,260
do okay next question is how long have

232
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:45,530
you been doing makeup I have been doing

233
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:48,020
makeup um I started in January of 2015

234
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:49,370
so just over three years I've been

235
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:52,460
working on bridal parties and I'm pretty

236
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:53,870
sure for just over two years um I wanted

237
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:56,180
to try and get as much experience as I

238
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:57,950
could before I like went full-on in to

239
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,060
like doing Bridal parties and we a

240
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:01,840
wedding makeup and stuff like that

241
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:04,190
because that was like a huge step for me

242
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,180
but yeah I've been doing makeup since

243
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:07,160
January 2015

244
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:08,360
is when I like started my journey that's

245
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,920
when I was like this is what I want to

246
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,620
do this is what I'm gonna do and then I

247
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:15,620
went for it okay next question is um oh

248
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:20,060
wait she has three what is your favorite

249
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:21,740

250
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:25,010

251
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:29,540
love that but I also love I love Hobby

252
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:30,860
Lobby and I love I love like Marshalls

253
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,599
and t.j.maxx because they just have

254
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,250
everything but I also obviously love

255
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:37,219
Target I'm just such a target girl I'm a

256
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:39,830
target a holic that's I just made that

257
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:41,630
up what tips do you have for ladies who

258
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:44,360
want to start freelancing

259
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:46,519
that's a good question um I think if I

260
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,750
had tips my first tip would be to save

261
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:49,910
your money because makeup is so

262
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:51,199
expensive and especially if you want to

263
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,699
have like a kit and you want to like be

264
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:54,730
working on other people makeup is a not

265
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:57,920
cheap I can't even tell you how many

266
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:59,569
many many dollars I've spent on makeup

267
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,009
and stuff like that because you have to

268
00:08:59,569 --> 00:09:02,180
take into consideration you have to get

269
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:03,410
different colors you have to get

270
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:05,300
different you know like foundation

271
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:07,130
shades concealer shades you have to get

272
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:09,199
bunch of different palettes and you know

273
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:10,699
you try to get I mean you try to get as

274
00:09:09,199 --> 00:09:12,380
many things as you can to be like as a

275
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:13,550
versatile as you can possibly be because

276
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,290
you're gonna be working on so many

277
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:17,360
different people so my first tip would

278
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:19,579
probably be to save your money because

279
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,459
it's expensive and it's a very it's a

280
00:09:19,579 --> 00:09:24,079
very expensive hobby turned into which

281
00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:26,540
can turn into a job if that's what

282
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:27,800
you're wanting to go for so definitely

283
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,660
save your money and also like I said

284
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,449
earlier get as much experience as you

285
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:33,740
can my biggest thing is people sometimes

286
00:09:32,449 --> 00:09:35,449
ask me this they're like how much should

287
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,040
I start charging like I'm just starting

288
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:38,120
out ah don't charge them anything

289
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,440
because if you don't know what you're

290
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,569
doing I feel like that's kind of not

291
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,250
fair for you to be like charging at the

292
00:09:41,569 --> 00:09:44,870
same time I understand that makeup costs

293
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,550
money but when I first started

294
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:48,350
freelancing I would have people bring me

295
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:49,519
all of their own products and like the

296
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,839
problem with that sometimes too is

297
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,680
people don't have the right stuff like

298
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:53,089
maybe they don't have the right color

299
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,310
maybe I don't have that shade for their

300
00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:56,839
like skin tone it happens but if you're

301
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:58,189
trying to like just get the experience

302
00:09:56,839 --> 00:09:59,569
of working with different products and

303
00:09:58,189 --> 00:10:02,899
different people and different faces I

304
00:09:59,569 --> 00:10:05,779
would say have them don't charge them

305
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:07,910
first of all but then I would say to you

306
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:09,709
know have used their stuff instead of

307
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:11,509
like buying a crap ton of stuff and like

308
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:13,130
not really maybe not knowing at what to

309
00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:15,050
do with it yet sorry there was something

310
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:17,029
floating right here but I would say use

311
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:18,680
the clients products use the stuff that

312
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:21,170
they have so then they that way they can

313
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,250
learn to use like what they have so they

314
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:23,899
don't have to say it you don't have to

315
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,819
tell them like okay here's what you need

316
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:27,860
go out and spend $500 on like all this

317
00:10:25,819 --> 00:10:29,750
stuff because you know it's expensive so

318
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,220
that's how II what I would say is I I

319
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:33,050
didn't charge people when I first

320
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,339
started because I just didn't I didn't

321
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,839
know what I was doing you know so I

322
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:38,089
wanted to just get that experience

323
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,740
before I was like okay fork it over you

324
00:10:38,089 --> 00:10:40,100
know that I mean just I mean things to

325
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,680
think about

326
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:44,300
alrighty the next question is I love the

327
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,620
week to makeup how did you how did you

328
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,660
get inspired to start doing makeup for

329
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,330
others thank you I got started doing

330
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,550
makeup like I said in

331
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:54,250
about 300 just over three years ago and

332
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:56,110
I was actually in the Target aisle and I

333
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,399
was just like I was I had to buy like

334
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:59,200
new makeup and stuff because that was

335
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:01,570
the one I bought all my stuff at oh my

336
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,730
god my gosh yeah sorry that's when I

337
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:05,649
bought all my makeup at the drugstore

338
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,910
like just at Target and I was standing

339
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:08,440
in the aisle and I thought you know I

340
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:10,810
think it'd be really fun to just like

341
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,640
buy new stuff like I'm just gonna throw

342
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:14,110
everything I have and I'm just gonna

343
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,760
start over like I'm just gonna buy new

344
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:16,839
product and just like try it out and see

345
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,399
how I like it and all that stuff just

346
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:20,140
kind of experiment with new things and

347
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,310
so I went home and I like was trying on

348
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:23,020
all this makeup and I thought wow this

349
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:24,610
is like so much fun like finding new

350
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:26,230
stuff and like figuring out like new

351
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,610
ways to do things and like new products

352
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:29,560
to use and I think that's kind of what

353
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:31,149
like made me feel like I kind of want to

354
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,800
start doing this like on regular basis

355
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:34,810
like if I started working on people and

356
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,430
like I knew that I was gonna I knew that

357
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:38,140
I was gonna have to figure out like

358
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:39,370
different ways to do things and I loved

359
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,750
like learning I feel like that's what I

360
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:42,370
love the most about makeup is because

361
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,630
it's just it's never one thing it's

362
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:45,399
always changing it's always like

363
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,990
something new it's always planets always

364
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:48,580
exciting and there's always so much to

365
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:50,470
learn like I feel like I just never

366
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:53,560
stopped learning in this industry like

367
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:55,390
which is so cool and I think I think

368
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,760
that's probably what started like what

369
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:59,709
made me want to start doing people

370
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,120
makeup on other people is just the fact

371
00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:03,430
that I wanted to like learn more about

372
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,500
how to do stuff and I obviously love

373
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:07,240
makeup I love applying it on people on

374
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,529
myself I love doing videos and some like

375
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,779
that I think I wanted to just find out

376
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:12,910
you know how how I could better myself

377
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:15,130
and how I could better the skill and the

378
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:17,589
skills that you that I need to do makeup

379
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:19,209
so I think that's probably why okay next

380
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:20,680
question is how did you first get into

381
00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:21,910
freelancing what are some tips you've

382
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,050
learned along the way regarding

383
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,670
freelancing and being prepared for

384
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:29,079
clients I feel like some tips that I've

385
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:30,490
learned is to really plan ahead I feel

386
00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:31,990
like once I have like a wedding coming

387
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:33,339
up I'm like that whole week I'm like

388
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:34,480
okay do I have this do I have this I

389
00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:35,980
have this do I have this drive enough

390
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,360
lashes do I have enough mascara do i

391
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,860
havnt hope you know like you just always

392
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,170
are trying to like go over everything in

393
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:43,270
your head um but I definitely would say

394
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:45,070
like being prepared and if you're not

395
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:46,600
like an organized person like start

396
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:49,029
trying to be organized because once you

397
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,800
go out and you're freelancing and people

398
00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:52,060
are relying on you for something I was

399
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,350
like big is like getting them ready for

400
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,790
their wedding or getting them ready for

401
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:56,589
prom we're getting ready for formal or

402
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:57,470
whatever it may be it's like a lot of

403
00:12:56,589 --> 00:12:59,120
pressure and it can be

404
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:00,530
pressure and when I first started I was

405
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,270
always like Oh am i doing it right like

406
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:03,380
am i okay like you know I was trying to

407
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:06,470
like I haven't I always second-guessing

408
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:07,640
myself but I think some tips I'm like I

409
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,840
kind of mentioned earlier is to like

410
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,700
save your money if you want to do

411
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:13,430
freelancing it costs a lot of money as

412
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:15,080
like a startup thing because you need so

413
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:18,200
much product and you need so many like

414
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:19,910
so many things of everything like you

415
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,530
just need multiples it's like you're

416
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:23,420
buying the stuff in bulk it's literally

417
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:25,070
like I have I can't even tell you how

418
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:26,540
many foundation tubes I have in these

419
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:28,660
drawers like it's ridiculous

420
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:30,830
but you just have to really be prepared

421
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:32,000
with for like how much money you're

422
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:34,910
gonna spend if this is something that

423
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,420
you want to get into it's not cheap the

424
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:39,560
more experience you get the more you can

425
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:41,120
obviously like you can start charging

426
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:43,670
people you can I and I wouldn't like I

427
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,580
think when I first started I charge like

428
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:48,590
oh my gosh like 35 or 40 dollars like

429
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:50,510
and that was like the base like this is

430
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:52,850
you know you can have me do whatever you

431
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:54,770
want and like now obviously years later

432
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:57,470
my prices have changed but you have to

433
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:59,060
you have to be really realistic when you

434
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:01,280
first start out in my opinion because

435
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:02,630
you can't be like okay day one I'm gonna

436
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,430
be a makeup artist today and I'm gonna

437
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:05,600
charge $125 like you just doesn't work

438
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:06,920
like that because people are not gonna

439
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,000
like people are not gonna pay that but I

440
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,610
think yeah those are probably my two

441
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,710
biggest tips another tip that I really

442
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:14,750
have is to take pictures of your work

443
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:17,300
because I think that's how I mean that

444
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:19,490
is how like I came to be like where I'm

445
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,750
at now it's through Instagram and people

446
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:22,430
you know some of my friends are always

447
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,750
like why do you take in scams seriously

448
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:25,640
like you're so dumb and I'm like um

449
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:27,020
because that's my job it's literally my

450
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,730
job that's how I make money and it's

451
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:30,050
like through Instagram I'm not like

452
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:31,940
literally through Instagram but because

453
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:33,980
I post pictures of clients and like you

454
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:35,000
know whatever I'm doing you know people

455
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,500
really get to know you through social

456
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,450
media they really get to see your work

457
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,100
like firsthand so I think that's

458
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:41,450
definitely like if you want to like take

459
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,190
this thing seriously you want to be a

460
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:44,900
freelance makeup artist I'd create a cat

461
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:46,580
create an account create your own like

462
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:48,980
personal Beauty account like I I

463
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:50,630
wouldn't I don't know I have mixed

464
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,920
feelings about like linking it to like

465
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:53,450
your main account like if you're just

466
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,460
like posting about I here no longer you

467
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:57,110
know on a Tuesday like I think if people

468
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,460
are gonna want to like see your work

469
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:00,770
work like you should have something

470
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:02,390
separate that's what I kind of did when

471
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:03,890
I first started like I just had my

472
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:05,329
makeup page I didn't have like another

473
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:07,189
Instagram and now like I

474
00:15:05,329 --> 00:15:09,139
kind of like I kind of mix things every

475
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:11,119
now and then but I have like my 1 for

476
00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:12,470
like here is my work makeup here is my

477
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:14,629
work Instagram and then I have another

478
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:16,189
one where it's like here's my Tuesday

479
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:18,439
but definitely utilizing social media

480
00:15:16,189 --> 00:15:20,809
was so big and so important for me and

481
00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:22,369
really really helped me tremendously and

482
00:15:20,809 --> 00:15:24,170
getting my name out there and having

483
00:15:22,369 --> 00:15:26,299
other people see my work and having you

484
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:28,069
know that's that's just how I built up I

485
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:29,509
wouldn't say it clientele because it's

486
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:31,009
not necessarily like I don't have too

487
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:32,480
many repeat clients just because like

488
00:15:31,009 --> 00:15:34,999
you really don't get your makeup done

489
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,709
for like a wedding like multiple times I

490
00:15:34,999 --> 00:15:38,239
mean maybe you do but like I mean think

491
00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:39,649
about if you're a bridal party like how

492
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,910
many how many weddings are you really

493
00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:42,170
and you didn't mean like you just don't

494
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:43,579
know like it's not like hair or you have

495
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:44,660
to get it done like every three months I

496
00:15:43,579 --> 00:15:46,970
think it was kind of a little bit

497
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:48,799
different but like I did get my name out

498
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:50,480
there and people started knowing me more

499
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:52,189
because of social media so I would

500
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,110
definitely say to utilize social media

501
00:15:52,189 --> 00:15:57,019
as well okay just a few more questions

502
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:58,639
here um I have a question about spray

503
00:15:57,019 --> 00:16:00,949
tans I really get them so I never know

504
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,559
what's the best way to prep your skin

505
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:06,529
for them what do you suggest okay so I

506
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:10,089
get spray tans very regularly what I do

507
00:16:06,529 --> 00:16:13,579
is I make sure to exfoliate my skin too

508
00:16:10,089 --> 00:16:15,259
how do I say this the two days before I

509
00:16:13,579 --> 00:16:16,730
get my spray tan so like typically I get

510
00:16:15,259 --> 00:16:18,169
my spray tans on Thursday so I'll make

511
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:20,419
sure to exfoliate my skin in the shower

512
00:16:18,169 --> 00:16:23,149
on Tuesday and on Wednesday night and

513
00:16:20,419 --> 00:16:26,660
then I usually just shave like the night

514
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:28,850
before so I'll exploit my skin and

515
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:31,519
everything on Tuesday and then I will

516
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:34,369
exfoliate and shave also on Wednesday

517
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:37,069
that's like the best way I got that's

518
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:38,929
how it works for me isolating your skin

519
00:16:37,069 --> 00:16:41,119
and like obviously shaving is just gonna

520
00:16:38,929 --> 00:16:42,949
make everything go on smoother I'm not

521
00:16:41,119 --> 00:16:44,179
like a skincare expert so I really don't

522
00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:46,850
know like the technical terms for

523
00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:48,980
everything but I do know that exfoliant

524
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:51,829
really helps this the tan to like stick

525
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:54,139
to your skin better and I exfoliate too

526
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:56,389
primarily because I have a tan on from

527
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:57,980
like before like I already have a little

528
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:59,720
bit of like tan like I can usually

529
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:01,279
always see it like on my arms right here

530
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,929
I don't know if like you can really see

531
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,730
it but like you see that gets white

532
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:06,289
right here and then it's like dark it's

533
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:08,689
because that's like it's a tan so I

534
00:17:06,289 --> 00:17:10,579
tried like exploit my skin so that this

535
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:13,339
that new tan will stay on and to also

536
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:15,470
get rid of the old tan so that's what I

537
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:17,240
suggest I mean the next question is what

538
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,740
are your favorite nude lipsticks

539
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,230
actually

540
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:22,990
