1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,600
hey guys welcome back so I recently

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,130
asked you guys on my Instagram if you

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,490
had any questions for me regarding

4
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:10,200
college life after college finding a job

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,389
career anything that had to do with

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,280
school and graduation and there's over

7
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:16,680
there's a good amount of questions I

8
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:20,939
typed out a hundred questions and I try

9
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:22,949
to get them down to about thirty maybe a

10
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:24,600
little more I broke them down into five

11
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:26,099
sections the first one will be about

12
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,779
context and background about my

13
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:29,609
experience when I majored in what school

14
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:31,470
I went to what grades I got I think

15
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:33,300
grades are important and then the second

16
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,950
section will be finding your thing or

17
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,469
like finding your purpose finding your

18
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,450
career slash calling and then we'll talk

19
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:41,430
about life post-grad my current career

20
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,170
path which is mostly YouTube and media

21
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,559
and the last section will be about life

22
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,879
advices in general so yeah there's a lot

23
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,579
of questions gonna try to get through

24
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:52,110
them ASAP and so let's get started thank

25
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,030

26
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,530

learning community and you guys up and

28
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,859

30
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:02,879
five hundred people a two month free

31
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:09,750
trial against this a little bit later

32
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:11,580
and let's start it how does she know

33
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,590
what you wanted to do I had no idea what

34
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,990
I wanted to do graduating from college I

35
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,619
had no idea I would be sitting here five

36
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,080
years later

37
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:21,030
making a video about my college

38
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,680
experience what was your major in

39
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,540
college what made you choose I majored

40
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,310
in business and then I chose that

41
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,750
because it could double in a lot of

42
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,130
things within business because there's

43
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,560
marketing there's finance there's

44
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,900
accounting there's so many things within

45
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,970
business out allowed for flexibility for

46
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,159
me to choose and for me to figure out as

47
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,570
I go how to be happy when you're in a

48
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,610
university which is in your dream

49
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:45,570
university you can always transfer the

50
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:48,390
only colleges that I got into after high

51
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:50,490
school were state colleges in California

52
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:52,649
saw the Cal States and UC Riverside I

53
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,060
went to UC Riverside because that was

54
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:56,340
the best option and they gave me a

55
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,020
decent amount of scholarship I knew

56
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,580
going in like this is the most important

57
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,400
part I knew going and I was going to

58
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:03,930
sir regardless if it was one year two

59
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,300
year three years I was going to transfer

60
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:09,060
to either a butter you see better

61
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,320
you see UCLA UC Berkeley or I was in a

62
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,060
transferred to USC and thankfully

63
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,740
everything worked out within one year so

64
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,020
as with anything in life if there's a

65
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,890
way if there's a will if there's a will

66
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,780
there's a way

67
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,430
you have to peel did you work during

68
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,910
school and if so how did you find

69
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,550
balance

70
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:25,530
I worked every summer starting from my

71
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:27,990
junior year of high school it's you know

72
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:30,120
year of college I was working while I

73
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:31,470
was going to school so I stacked there's

74
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,420
something here that wants to come out

75
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:34,980
but it's not coming out I stuck to my

76
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:38,160
classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays so

77
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:39,750
it's from like 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. or 6

78
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,490
p.m. all day I packed back-to-back

79
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,050
classes so that Monday Wednesdays and

80
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:45,090
Fridays I could work and I was working

81
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:47,250
at a social media agency are great

82
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:49,050
important and we stress about getting

83
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,940
good grades so much that we don't live

84
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:52,830
in the moment

85
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:54,960
this is tricky I want to say no but it's

86
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,430
also a yes because it really depends on

87
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,560
what you want to do after you graduate

88
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,330
the internships that I have one was out

89
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,450
of granola bar company called this bar

90
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:06,989
same size for every bar that you I they

91
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:09,180
will give a life-saving bar to a kid in

92
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:11,220
need it's kind of like palm a for-profit

93
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,930
before good one for one model so I

94
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,400
worked out companies like that most of

95
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,890
my other friends are going to consulting

96
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,140
and us my making because those are like

97
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:21,090
the legit jobs and when you were in a

98
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,920
hyper-competitive environment where

99
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,630
everyone's studying business and I was

100
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,400
in a business fraternity you kind of get

101
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:28,530
tunnel vision and you just want to be

102
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,910
the best and that's kind of what the

103
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:32,400
best things were but I was like I'm just

104
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:35,070
gonna do me even if people think I'm not

105
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,840
as legit which they did they thought I

106
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:40,230
was in legit because I didn't have a

107
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,930
fancy job but I was like I just gonna do

108
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:45,239
me someone I wanna be happy grand scheme

109
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:47,310
of things I don't think grades matter at

110
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:49,290
all because the fact that we're alive

111
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,700
and that we're breathing and that we

112
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:53,190
were born it's like a one thing a

113
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:56,670
billionth chance so why limit ourselves

114
00:03:53,190 --> 00:04:00,090
and wide to find ourselves by grades but

115
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:01,470
then again if you know a career want and

116
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,570
grades are important then increase are

117
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:06,660
important do you have good grades in

118
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:08,920
university I graduated with barely a 3.0

119
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:11,239
I think I had a 3.0 one or three

120
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,280
so no but I'm proud of myself for

121
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:16,130
graduating with a third point above a

122
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,680
3.0 GPA how do you stay happy in college

123
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:21,380
through all of this dress so I say happy

124
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,660
through drinking and partying and going

125
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:25,699
to raves and having fun with my friends

126
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:28,550
and I put more emphasis on that than I

127
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:30,410
did on my studies but the thing is I

128
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:32,210
kind of shot myself in the foot because

129
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:33,860
I wasn't even happy when I was doing

130
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:35,990
that I was doing that because I was

131
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:37,520
avoiding reality I was avoiding my

132
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:39,949
responsibility some of the thoughts in

133
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:43,100
my head and I was avoiding myself I was

134
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:45,169
avoid facing myself so what I wish this

135
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:47,419
upon anyone else I don't think so but I

136
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:49,520
would say that I think it's so important

137
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:51,680
to enjoy our youths I don't regret

138
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,360
anything I did because now that I'm here

139
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,010
I'm like okay been there done that never

140
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,200
want to be there again but I know what

141
00:04:55,010 --> 00:05:00,020
it's like so I think it's important that

142
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:02,930
omits airing yourself in books and

143
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,950
studying to your head out every once in

144
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:06,169
a while oh wow

145
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:09,380
have fun with your friends go enjoy

146
00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:10,970
being a teen or like a 20-something year

147
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:12,740
old because we're never gonna get that

148
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:14,690
back the older you get the more

149
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:16,370
responsibilities you have and I guess on

150
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,000
that note if I could do it all over

151
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,710
again

152
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,229
I would spend more time getting to know

153
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:23,450
myself for sure I didn't know how to do

154
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:25,970
it back then looking inward reflecting

155
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:27,800
asking myself the hard questions so that

156
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:31,099
I'm not just like avoiding and running

157
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:34,010
away all the time and also to not take

158
00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:35,660
office hours professors school like

159
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:37,669
offerings like our school or

160
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:39,620
universities there's so many resources

161
00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:41,120
that I just completely like I didn't

162
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,130
care most important thing I took for

163
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,900
granted was the proximity and which I

164
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:46,580
lived with my friends now I'm in New

165
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:50,300
York most of my friends are in San

166
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:52,220
Francisco or LA so it's like you can't

167
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:54,830
really you know I suck at keeping in

168
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:56,150
touch the phones and messages like I'm

169
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:59,380
really good with people when I'm like

170
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:01,660
face-to-face but I'm terrible with

171
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:04,180
keeping up with people they're texting

172
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:07,370
so that's something I'm working on but

173
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:09,470
that's that how to be mindful over your

174
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:11,180
future rather than let fear of it stress

175
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:13,780
you out so I'm reading this really great

176
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:15,730
book called 10% happier and I'm gonna

177
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:17,560
quote starving is fine as long as is

178
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:19,810
tempered by the realization that in

179
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,790
entropic universe the final outcome is

180
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:23,560
out of your control if you don't waste

181
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:25,810
your energy on variables you cannot

182
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,000
influence you can focus much more

183
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:30,070
effectively on those you can when you're

184
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,230
wisely ambitious you do everything you

185
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:33,580
can to succeed but you're not attached

186
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:35,350
to the outcome either this is the most

187
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:37,510
important you're not attached to the

188
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:40,120
outcome so that if you fail you will be

189
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:42,400
maximally resilient able to get up dust

190
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,200
yourself off and get back in the fray do

191
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,910
you believe in 5-year plans or do you

192
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:50,890
think you should take life as a hits yet

193
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:52,840
so I was firm believer in the five-year

194
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:56,650
plan in the one three five and ten-year

195
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:58,090
plan that was textbook Rowena but over

196
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:00,669
the years especially when I started

197
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:02,320
YouTube I just realized that life is

198
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:04,930
constantly changing cuz you want to

199
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:08,710
control it you can so I've learned to

200
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:10,660
accept and embrace uncertainty as my

201
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:12,820
reality instead of trying to line

202
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:15,880
everything down to the T because no

203
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:17,770
matter how much you plan things are

204
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,940
gonna happen things aren't gonna go

205
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,490
according to plan

206
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:24,220
historically I've been a very J like a

207
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:27,610
hardcore J from the myers-briggs like

208
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:29,560
judgment document pull something with

209
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:31,330
the J I've learned to become more

210
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:35,080
perceiving I've learned to become more

211
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:37,570
go with the flow take life as it comes

212
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:39,250
like enjoy the breeze and not to be so

213
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:41,140
you know with planning so yeah I think

214
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:44,770
I'm more of the latter now take life as

215
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:47,169
it hits yeah that made me giggle okay

216
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:49,690
what can I do to support my bestie who

217
00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:52,750
is in college and horribly burnt out no

218
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:55,479
I'd say kidnap your bestie to go on a

219
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:57,729
BFF date and if she's like I cannot

220
00:07:55,479 --> 00:08:00,130
leave my studies for more than X amount

221
00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:02,320
of time then just take her to grab food

222
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:04,690
get her mind off of her studies when

223
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:07,120
you're so in something you need to be

224
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:10,270
peeled out and peeled off and I think in

225
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:13,270
retrospect me and all my friends as much

226
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:15,220
as we might have not like do the moment

227
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:17,710
you're like ripping us away from our

228
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:20,020
studies in the long run it was like

229
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:24,120
thank you think now looking back instead

230
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:24,120
of like thank you for looking out for me

231
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:29,560
what do I do if I can't find a purpose

232
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:32,140
right after school I'm scared of

233
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:35,110
becoming stagnant the thing with finding

234
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:36,880
your purpose I was a solution when I

235
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:39,580
thought that after I found my purpose my

236
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,320
life would just be smooth sailing now

237
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,940
you will find your purpose and then

238
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,800
you'll be tested again and you'll kind

239
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,270
of forget and you'll find it again and

240
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,649
they'll kind of lose it again and they

241
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:49,600
kind of find it again I mean that's just

242
00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:51,779
life we as humans are constantly

243
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,850
changing and growing so our North Star

244
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:57,730
may be implanted in the sky for the

245
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:59,410
foreseeable future but the closer you

246
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:00,490
get to it you might be able to see it

247
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:03,010
from a different perspective

248
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:04,720
so although your North Star doesn't

249
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:06,550
change you're constantly changing and

250
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,500
the way in which you get to that North

251
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:10,390
Star or let fall of that North Star may

252
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,339
also change this wall so I think what's

253
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:13,630
most important is to never stop learning

254
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:17,260
always stay curious

255
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:19,209
with a growth mindset you can't go wrong

256
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:21,430
and you won't be stagnant because if

257
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:22,959
you're always willing to learn if you're

258
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:24,550
always questioning if you're always

259
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,279
curious about the world around you

260
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:29,740
that's the recipe for not staying

261
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,420
stagnant a few ways that I've continued

262
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:33,490
to learn after I graduated

263
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:36,250
one is through reading I love business

264
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:38,470
and self-help books and I just recently

265
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:40,300
got into more like fiction books I think

266
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:42,640
sometimes are too wild and crazy' for me

267
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:45,190
but it is great to let your mind explore

268
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,810
and implant your brain into different

269
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:48,459
universes every once in a while and

270
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:51,339
another way is through online courses

271
00:09:48,459 --> 00:09:53,260
like Skillshare so Scotia is an online

272
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:56,170
learning community with over 25,000

273
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:58,690
classes and design business creativity

274
00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:00,550
anything arts you can think of how to

275
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:02,290
edit videos how to paint there's

276
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:03,010
actually a course on there that I want

277
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,050
to share with you guys it's called

278
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:08,320
discovering success 7 exercises to

279
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:10,360
uncover your purpose passion and hat I

280
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,490
think this is great for anyone who is

281
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,140
kind of like what do I do

282
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:15,640
I kind of have this creative thing that

283
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:18,520
I want to do but there's also this like

284
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:20,440
more stable financially sound path that

285
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:22,420
I want to walk like which path do I take

286
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,310
she does a really good job of breaking

287
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:25,990
everything down and I talked about these

288
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:28,450
things in my older videos but never end

289
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:30,820
up like this so it's like redefining

290
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:31,560
what success means to you breaking free

291
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:34,110
of

292
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,610
going back to the beginning listening to

293
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:38,460
what you love choosing a direction

294
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:40,290
managing your time money strategies so I

295
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:42,330
think all of these are really important

296
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:43,710
things and topics there's not as many

297
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:45,270
crash courses on this like you don't

298
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,529
learn about these things in school this

299
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,779
is something you're interested in the

300
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:51,300
first 500 people will get a two-month

301
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:53,850
premium membership trouble which will

302
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:58,620
give you access to all of the courses on

303
00:10:53,850 --> 00:11:00,330
Skillshare so there's that moving on I

304
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,620
got rejected from nursing school three

305
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:04,620
times that I don't know what to do from

306
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:06,690
here do I change paths I think this

307
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,940
comes down to how badly do you want to

308
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:11,370
be a nurse if you know it is your life's

309
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:14,070
calling if you know I must be a nurse

310
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:17,700
because you love helping people and you

311
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:19,920
want to help save lives then keep

312
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:22,260
applying and don't take no for an answer

313
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,940
and I think this is with anything in

314
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,290
life any job that you're thinking of if

315
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,600
you want something badly enough you're

316
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:30,600
gonna keep trying until you get it yes

317
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,730
but if you ask yourself and you're like

318
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:35,400
I think I want to be a nurse because

319
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:37,080
it's what is expected of me or it's what

320
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,910
I thought I should do because of

321
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,850
something other than what you wanted to

322
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:43,320
do for yourself then maybe maybe it's a

323
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:45,540
sign from the universe that you should

324
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:48,570
pivot but these answers only we will

325
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:49,290
know when we spend the quiet hours with

326
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:51,600
our own thoughts

327
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:54,560
late at night or early in the mornings

328
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,770
when you're just questioning everything

329
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,390
okay

330
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:59,880
advice on choosing the career you want

331
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:01,800
versus the career that pays better it's

332
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,480
tough so there's two things the first

333
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:07,200
thing I would say is the career that

334
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:09,300
pays well is like a steady pay right and

335
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,390
the baby by the time you're 60 you're

336
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:14,220
like here the career that you want may

337
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:15,810
not pay well in the beginning there's

338
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:19,260
three years five years you might be

339
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:22,230
making nothing but the potential of it

340
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:25,920
growing exponentially is a lot more than

341
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:28,200
that like stable career path or there's

342
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,000
a lot more potential and possibility for

343
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,680
it to grow so that's the first thing

344
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,180
question that I ask myself is long-term

345
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,880
fulfillment versus short-term

346
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:37,650
satisfaction I think a stable career

347
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,910
path definitely falls into short-term

348
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:41,150
satisfaction because you don't really

349
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:42,800
have to think about most things and you

350
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:46,370
have your life planned out for you

351
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:48,350
long-term for fulfillment if you're

352
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:50,330
gonna eventually do what you want to do

353
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,920
which is what I think most rational

354
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:54,380
humans go through that's why we have

355
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,670
midlife crises where we doubt everything

356
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:57,740
and we question everything and we look

357
00:12:55,670 --> 00:13:00,080
back and like why did I live my life for

358
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:02,390
the past five decades like this when

359
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:05,210
it's not what I wanted to do or it's not

360
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:09,710
who I am what really helped me stay true

361
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:11,570
to my path and to not waver when I wave

362
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:13,430
I wavered a lot actually but what helped

363
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:15,640
me stay grounded was that if you're

364
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:18,140
going to go down this path eventually

365
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:19,760
might as well go down went now how to

366
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:21,050
stay positive when others are doubting

367
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,850
my next steps I really think it's

368
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,110
self-awareness if you know yourself well

369
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:26,170
enough you know what you're doing if you

370
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:30,560
know why you're doing what you're doing

371
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:33,320
which can change and which can be cloudy

372
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:36,620
at times but if you have a decent enough

373
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:39,680
understanding it'll allow you to not

374
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:42,380
care as much about what others say or

375
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:45,290
tell you but that being said it's good

376
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:46,970
to it's good to listen to what other

377
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:48,890
people are saying and it's good to

378
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:51,980
listen to their advices whether you take

379
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:55,430
it or not it's fully up to yourself okay

380
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:58,040
advice for graduates who've decided to

381
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:59,720
take creative and unconventional paths I

382
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,890
don't know why that was so choppy and

383
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,660
what I was just reading it I think the

384
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:05,090
hardest part is over taking that leap of

385
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:07,880
faith leaving in yourself and working

386
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:10,040
through all the knots and a mess in your

387
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,650
head to be like I'm gonna do this so

388
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:15,650
keep doing it but also remember if you

389
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:17,600
have to pivot and change your course and

390
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:19,370
change your path as you walk this path

391
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,070
it's not failure right you're not

392
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:23,930
failing if you didn't do the thing you

393
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:26,930
set out to do I think life is a

394
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:29,360
continual process of iterations and

395
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:31,070
pivoting and changing and I've always

396
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,930
thought a path is like this but I think

397
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:37,550
life is actually more like this and

398
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:39,200
sometimes like you know okay what helped

399
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:41,000
you find your purpose and how did you

400
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,890
know that you found it this question is

401
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,390
gonna take way too long I'll link to

402
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,950
videos down below I mean I hate when

403
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:48,350
people do this because like just told me

404
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:50,780
no but seriously I have

405
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:52,580
other videos one is about I created my

406
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:54,230
dream job and the second is how I found

407
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:56,480
my life purpose so those two will be

408
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:58,280
linked down below below how many years

409
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,280
passed after graduation when you were

410
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:03,680
content with your place and life so I

411
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:06,920
was content the day I graduated I was so

412
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,300
happy the day I graduated I was like yes

413
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,970
I don't know school wasn't really for me

414
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:12,350
I don't really learn in that like school

415
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:14,990
environment I wasn't good at taking

416
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:17,210
tests in Foley I didn't let that define

417
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:19,670
me too much because I knew I had

418
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:22,250
strengths outside of taking tests but

419
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:24,290
when I finally felt like I could breathe

420
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:26,210
and that I could look at myself in the

421
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:29,240
mirror and tell myself you did well

422
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:34,160
Romina child he did well it was actually

423
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:36,200
earlier this year most difficult

424
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,260
adjustment you had to make going into

425
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:41,150
life post graduation I think the most

426
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:42,620
difficult thing I think it's not

427
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:44,360
comparing myself to those around me

428
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:46,310
because the path that I chose for myself

429
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,170
was very different it wasn't what other

430
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:49,880
people were doing and it's so easy to

431
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:51,500
look around me and to be like all of my

432
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,820
friends already started working all my

433
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,440
friends are you started making money all

434
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:56,630
my friends they're doing the things

435
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,390
already and it just felt like I was

436
00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:02,030
gonna fall behind I already fell behind

437
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:04,040
because I didn't go down that path but

438
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:06,200
then I just kept reminding myself the

439
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,010
whole short-term satisfaction versus

440
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,810
long-term game

441
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:12,620
short-term satisfaction would have been

442
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:16,730
to that my ego and to do what I thought

443
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:18,800
I should do a I knew long-term that was

444
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:20,600
gonna make me happy what do you wish you

445
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,200
had done in your final year to prepare

446
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,970
you for life

447
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,740
after graduation I think going back to

448
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:27,610
what I said earlier I wish I spent more

449
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:30,770
time in here like trying to work out

450
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:32,960
this and like this and being a better

451
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:35,000
friend to myself and trying to get to

452
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,290
know myself better because I did a lot

453
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,030
of that after graduating but if I

454
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:40,640
started doing that in college I think

455
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:42,080
that would have helped a lot a lot has

456
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:44,510
graduation helped define you as a person

457
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:46,760
and what success means to you has

458
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:50,000
graduation helped define you as a person

459
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:55,250
uh not really I feel like I don't really

460
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:58,190
talk about USC at all after graduating I

461
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,560
realized I like found my definition of

462
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:00,629
sex

463
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,670
and it definitely wasn't my grades it

464
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:05,429
wasn't the fact that I graduated it

465
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:07,740
wasn't the job that I would get nothing

466
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:11,130
success to me at that time was just

467
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:13,020
being able to find the answer to what it

468
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:16,620
means to live a meaningful and

469
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:18,720
fulfilling life I think that was what my

470
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:21,539
definition was of success at that time

471
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:24,000
and it's constantly changing I think now

472
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:25,650
for me talks about this in my podcast

473
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,630
with Eileen from lab and dare I think

474
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:29,460
success to me now me it just means like

475
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:33,990
being able to go to sleep at night

476
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:36,000
content with how the day went I mean

477
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:38,970
it's very like there's a lot of layers

478
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,700
to that and me being able to go to sick

479
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:43,590
content is that I did my best and

480
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:46,500
everything that I could during the day

481
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:48,870
for work by helping people because my

482
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,520
work is trying to help people in many

483
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:51,659
different ways either through beating

484
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,820
with it or through my own personal

485
00:17:51,659 --> 00:17:55,080
channel so there's a lot of layers to

486
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:58,080
that by think at the end of the day like

487
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:00,480
the our definition of success should be

488
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,909
defined by ourselves and it's normal if

489
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:06,179
it changes over time because we're

490
00:18:02,909 --> 00:18:09,510
constantly changing as people ever felt

491
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:11,280
lost professionally post-college if so

492
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:13,950
how did you deal slash break out of it

493
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:16,919
yeah dude I felt professionally lost up

494
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:23,880
until I'd say last year so I graduated

495
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:26,429
2014 2014 to 15 16 17 18 for years for

496
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,710
years I was like what am I doing with my

497
00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:30,780
life did I make the right decisions why

498
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:32,520
am I here what is the right path is

499
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,780
there even a right path and the answer I

500
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,309
talked about in last week's video I

501
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,679
don't really think there is a right path

502
00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:39,390
I think our path is a culmination of the

503
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,549
decisions we've made in our lives and

504
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:43,140
eventually it like it's there already if

505
00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:45,030
you believe in fate if you believe in

506
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:47,340
destiny like our path is there we just

507
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:50,399
need to walk it and if so how did you

508
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:53,010
deal / break out of it just have to keep

509
00:18:50,399 --> 00:18:55,289
walking even if it's blind faith even if

510
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:57,240
it's with mustering every ounce of

511
00:18:55,289 --> 00:18:59,309
courage you have in the depths of your

512
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:01,200
soul - just like trust yourself and

513
00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:03,270
trust the universe to move forward and

514
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,970
it goes back to learning staying curious

515
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:08,130
trying your best and not being attached

516
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:10,220
to the end results how difficult was it

517
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:12,779
to move to New York City did you do it

518
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:13,470
it wasn't difficult at all and yes I did

519
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:15,840
it alone

520
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:18,059
how long did it take to fully transition

521
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:22,289
from moving across the country to New

522
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:25,140
York I think because I moved around so

523
00:19:22,289 --> 00:19:27,929
often when I was young it just like it

524
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:29,370
wasn't a thing I just knew I needed I

525
00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:32,370
want it to be in New York and so I just

526
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:33,659
went and I just lived and I it just kind

527
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:35,820
of happened

528
00:19:33,659 --> 00:19:38,400
did you want to continue studying to

529
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:40,470
avoid working absolutely not I hated

530
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,960
studying I couldn't wait to graduate

531
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:46,620
from high school college I think I had

532
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,690
more fun but I also know that I don't

533
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:54,299
like studying at all all right now we're

534
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:56,490
gonna move to career /youtube I think

535
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:58,320
I'll do a separate video answering your

536
00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:00,000
guys's questions about YouTube starting

537
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,490
YouTube wanting to start YouTube advice

538
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,289
for starting YouTube but this one is a

539
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:06,270
little it's a little more broad how do

540
00:20:04,289 --> 00:20:07,710
you decide what to do in life / as a

541
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:09,720
career when you're not sure what do you

542
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:11,760
enjoy I think just constant forward

543
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,130
movement or just constant movement it

544
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,200
could be lateral it could be vertical it

545
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:18,240
could be any type of movement but as

546
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,789
long as you're trying as long as you're

547
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:24,570
actively engaging yourself and

548
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:26,429
everything in you to try new things you

549
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:28,320
will find your thing eventually when I

550
00:20:26,429 --> 00:20:30,330
graduated I thought I was gonna start my

551
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,640
own business that didn't happen we can

552
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:34,710
just say it failed I thought I was gonna

553
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,750
code cuz I love tech startup so I was

554
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:38,399
like I could do that UX UI that seems

555
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:40,010
really cool but like that also didn't

556
00:20:38,399 --> 00:20:44,070
really go anywhere because I couldn't

557
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:47,610
like I just I can like the coding

558
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:49,830
language just symbols and numbers just

559
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:52,409
they didn't work with me and my

560
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:54,779
neighbor's dog is just right outside so

561
00:20:52,409 --> 00:20:56,820
if I hear the dog barking went into

562
00:20:54,779 --> 00:20:58,620
media work never in a million years what

563
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:01,140
I thought I would work in journalism or

564
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:03,210
at a media company because my focus was

565
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:04,860
very a tech and business and then

566
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:07,380
started my youtube channel and start

567
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:09,360
helping on beauty within it just kind of

568
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:11,490
all came together as I like progressed

569
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:14,580
in life and there are this whole journey

570
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:15,929
it was a lot of a lot of wavering a lot

571
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,980
of back-and-forth a lot of doubting a

572
00:21:15,929 --> 00:21:18,270
lot of questioning of what it's the

573
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:20,290
right path what is the right thing to do

574
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:22,510
that's why I said it or a little

575
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:24,940
that there really is no right path just

576
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:27,070
keep walking and keep believing in

577
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:28,840
yourself keep questioning yourself like

578
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:30,940
healthily questioning yourself I'm

579
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,020
reminding yourself of who you are and

580
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:34,750
what you're doing why are you doing what

581
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:36,820
you're doing and then eventually the

582
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:39,700
path will reveal itself as it did with

583
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:41,740
me yeah

584
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:45,910
when should I really start applying for

585
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:49,420
jobs this is really up to you if you

586
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:53,770
want advice as a Marshall School

587
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:57,160
graduate you would start your sophomore

588
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:58,930
year of college applying for internships

589
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:01,390
because that's how competitive people

590
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:04,540
are nowadays you get an internship

591
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:06,670
sophomore junior year at a big firm they

592
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:09,610
will most likely give you an offer

593
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:11,380
when you graduate your senior year but

594
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:13,240
if you ask Rowena Rowena

595
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:16,720
when's the best time to apply for

596
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:18,370
college it's up to you maybe you don't

597
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,810
want to apply to jobs maybe you do want

598
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,040
to apply to jobs what jobs do you want

599
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:22,540
to apply for I think those are questions

600
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:26,020
that only we'll be able to answer for

601
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:27,640
yourself do companies actually prefer

602
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:30,040
someone with a college degree for a job

603
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:32,320
in your industry so I think it depends

604
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:34,570
if you want to work on like the agency

605
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:37,570
side I think it helps to have a degree

606
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:40,210
to ten extent most corporations do look

607
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:42,700
at your as a man they kind of do care

608
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:46,210
what that like you went to college at

609
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:49,330
least but what I am doing right now like

610
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:51,340
as a creator you can have zero degree

611
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:55,390
and you can create content anyone can

612
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:56,800
create content how to find work in the

613
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:59,500
media industry when it's so competitive

614
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,670
so I think with this it's it doesn't

615
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,620
matter if it's media it doesn't matter

616
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:04,150
what industry that you're going for I

617
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:05,650
think going back to the whole Dyson

618
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:07,900
analogy of if you want something badly

619
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:10,120
enough you won't stop until you get a

620
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:12,310
yes and one thing that I was actually

621
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:15,970
pretty surprised to find was that you

622
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:18,790
can use your student card so hard so

623
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:20,920
reach out to ten people on LinkedIn who

624
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:22,900
has a job that you might be interested

625
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:24,850
in and ask for an informational

626
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:26,740
interview and what this means is that

627
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:29,200
you can just ask them about their career

628
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:29,900
ask them about their life their path how

629
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,420
they got there

630
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:34,190
and you'd be surprised at least two out

631
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:36,200
of ten people will say yes to you it's a

632
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:37,970
natural human instinct to want to help

633
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,830
other people if you reach out as a

634
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:40,970
student and you say like hey I'm not

635
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:43,040
really sure what I want to do with my

636
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:44,090
life maybe you don't say that'd be a

637
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,850
little more professional but if you

638
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:48,530
allude to that then the person reading

639
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:49,940
it like a professional reading that

640
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:52,580
would be like oh I remember what it was

641
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:55,880
like when I graduated so like yes yes

642
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:58,309
yes I will help you asking people who

643
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:00,800
already there for their thoughts and

644
00:23:58,309 --> 00:24:04,910
their advice that's really probably like

645
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:06,679
the best way to go and also send your

646
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:08,630
resume to as many people as you can

647
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:11,150
don't be afraid of being annoying

648
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:13,580
message recruiters keep in touch with

649
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:16,190
recruiters there's a lot that you can do

650
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:18,050
go to career fairs get to know the

651
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:21,500
recruiters from different companies that

652
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:23,750
you want to work at there's a lot yeah

653
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:26,179
not being afraid of getting nose and

654
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:28,370
also not being afraid of being mildly

655
00:24:26,179 --> 00:24:29,870
moderately annoying persistence

656
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:32,750
for the most part will always work in

657
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:36,640
your favor and moving on to the last

658
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:36,640
section of life advice

659
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:44,090
what are lessons you've learned in

660
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:48,679
college that you still value today what

661
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:50,360
did I learn in college I think I learned

662
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:52,490
a lot about what I don't want to do and

663
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:55,070
how I don't want to feel yeah I think

664
00:24:52,490 --> 00:25:00,650
that's probably the biggest takeaway how

665
00:24:55,070 --> 00:25:03,620
lost and how alone and how down I felt

666
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:07,070
it's really good gauge for me to never

667
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:09,050
return to that lifestyle and that stage

668
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:11,900
of my life the partying the drinking the

669
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:14,870
avoiding the running away the not facing

670
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:16,700
myself not facing my reality yeah I

671
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:19,100
think that's probably the biggest

672
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:21,190
takeaway one piece of advice you give

673
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:26,840
yourself if you went back in time to

674
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:29,510
2014 everything that I say will probably

675
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:31,880
be very cliche but I think the most

676
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:35,210
important thing would be you're not

677
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:38,150
alone everything will work out don't

678
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:40,250
stop dreaming and keep fighting for what

679
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:42,430
you believe in yeah I think those are

680
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:45,430
like the four most important things

681
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:48,280
yeah this is why my child only do this

682
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:51,130
if I can help even one you guys for less

683
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:52,900
alone and less crazy for dreaming the

684
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:55,200
way you dream and for wanting to do the

685
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:58,960
things that want to do then I've

686
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,550
succeeded navigating life is never easy

687
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,410
finding your purpose is never easy

688
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:04,330
finding your Y is never easy and it's

689
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:06,340
it's the most difficult because it's

690
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:09,820
something that we have to do and we can

691
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:12,580
only do on our own but we don't have to

692
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:14,230
as in like the answers you will find

693
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:17,290
yourself and it's like it's very

694
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:18,850
personal but the journey you don't have

695
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:20,380
to go through that alone and I think

696
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:23,230
that's what I learned few years after I

697
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:25,180
graduated so with all of that I hope

698
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:27,160
