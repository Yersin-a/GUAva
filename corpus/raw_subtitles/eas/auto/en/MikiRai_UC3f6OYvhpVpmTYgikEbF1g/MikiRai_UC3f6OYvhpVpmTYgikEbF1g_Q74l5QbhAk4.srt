1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,950
hello you guys what's up we are back

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,899
today with another video and today is

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:10,290
actually a Valentine's Day which is why

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:11,849
I look kind of decent for once you're

5
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,769
probably watching this video a day after

6
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:16,410
Valentine's Day because I am the

7
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:18,449
freaking master procrastinator and I do

8
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,970
not film and edit things until the very

9
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:22,800
last minute but in my full defense this

10
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,830
is actually the fourth time that I

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,109
filmed this video the first time my mic

12
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,939
wasn't on and so there was no audio the

13
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:34,230
second time I look like an actual

14
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:36,210
freaking potato the third time okay so I

15
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,399
have filmed all the cumin haze I

16
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,329
attempted to film this Q&A like two

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,370
three weeks ago

18
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:44,219
yeah and 20/20 has just been such a

19
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,500
great year but my headspace is like in a

20
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:47,940
completely different space now and so my

21
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,680
headspace in a completely different

22
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,300
space now is that even something you can

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,660
say I am just in a completely different

24
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,640
headspace now and so watching my own

25
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,850
video from two weeks ago really made me

26
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,550
cringe so hard that means we're growing

27
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:05,519
right so I'm back today I asked you guys

28
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:07,260
again I'm sorry for the 12-time if you

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,119
guys had questions for me but I'm gonna

30
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,650
jump right into these by the way if you

31
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,479
don't already follow me on Instagram you

32
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,460
should go follow me there as well as odd

33
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,409
my tik-tok because they post content on

34
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:19,170
there a lot more often than once a week

35
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:22,860
so I'll see you there some of these are

36
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:25,590
a little juicy so how much money do you

37
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,270
make as a nurse so if you want to know

38
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,450
how much money someone makes you can

39
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:32,880
just school their job title and also

40
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,920
what city they live in and it'll give

41
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,340
you a pretty good idea of how much money

42
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,320
they make I do live in the Bay Area or

43
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,970
near the Bay Area so if you look at that

44
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,280
you'll get a pretty good idea of how

45
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:46,350
much money I make I can tell you that

46
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,750
when I started out as a new grad I

47
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:52,380
worked in Los Angeles and I made I think

48
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:54,930
it was like 46 dollars an hour but that

49
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,329
number quickly went up after my sixth

50
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,909
month and then also my one-year mark how

51
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:01,979
did you graduate debt-free so I was

52
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:04,979
extremely lucky to graduate college

53
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:06,840
without any debt which means I don't

54
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:08,610
have any student loans or anything to

55
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,050
pay off which is really really nice I

56
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,140
can just focus on saving for my

57
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,270
retirement

58
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:15,370
saving for my house and you know those

59
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:17,260
kinds of goals but the reason that I was

60
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:19,300
able to graduate debt-free was because

61
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:21,130
when I was in high school I was a pretty

62
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:24,250
ambitious high schooler I was pretty on

63
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:27,190
top of all my stuff and I applied to so

64
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:29,140
many scholarships every scholarship that

65
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:31,420
I was eligible to apply for I basically

66
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:33,010
applied for the application for

67
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,630
scholarships is pretty similar it's

68
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:37,420
always like some kind of essay slash

69
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:39,220
personal statement slash cover letter in

70
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,600
addition to your resume and then maybe

71
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,340
likes a supplemental essays but I

72
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,050
basically applied for a bunch of

73
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,490
scholarships I obviously didn't get all

74
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:47,830
of them but the ones that I did get

75
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:49,900
really did add up I also did receive

76
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:52,120
scholarships from UCLA so that was

77
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:54,610
extremely helpful in terms of cost of

78
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,440
living my parents were very very amazing

79
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:58,750
I'm very grateful that they helped me

80
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,459
pay for paying friend 12 is in college I

81
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:02,230
never lived on campus because living on

82
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:04,180
campus if you didn't already know it's

83
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,850
extremely expensive I want to say it's

84
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:09,400
like 15k a year at UCLA ended up living

85
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:11,830
off campus I lived in a triple for all

86
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,590
three years I was at UCLA and my rent

87
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:16,570
was anywhere from six hundred seven

88
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:18,100
hundred dollars a month and that's

89
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,840
living with two other girls in the same

90
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,489
room so just keep that in mind but we

91
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,830
were also in Westwood which is kind of a

92
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:26,620
very nice bougie part of the life and

93
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:29,920
then in terms of actual like living

94
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:31,540
expenses so like food or buying clothes

95
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,880
or like going shopping and buying things

96
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:36,010
that I wanted I have always worked

97
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,200
pretty much since it was legal for me to

98
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:40,810
work even before it was legal for me to

99
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:44,230
work as a kid I was like selling pencils

100
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:46,030
to my classmates I was dog sitting for

101
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:48,850
other people and when I turned 16 I

102
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:52,840
started working at a bakery so I was a

103
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:54,580
barista and also was like a cashier also

104
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,080
worked in some labs and then when I went

105
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:58,000
to college I also continued to work

106
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,430
part-time and so all that money is my

107
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,900
money to spend and I've never had to ask

108
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:03,760
my parents for money you think I've been

109
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,380
really wise with my monetary decisions

110
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,209
because all the money is like money that

111
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:09,640
a super a hard earned to me

112
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:11,890
so for example my first ever job I made

113
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,810
$8 an hour and so it really put into

114
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:16,239
perspective like hey if I'm gonna buy

115
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:18,250
this $40.00 thing I have to work five

116
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:19,310
hours is that really worth it for me to

117
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:22,880
purchase item

118
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:24,350
do you plan on always being a nurse the

119
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,530
great thing about nursing is that it is

120
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:28,970
such a flexible career there are so many

121
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,260
things that you can do with it you can

122
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,360
work in the hospital you can work in the

123
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:35,720
clinic you can do you can work remotely

124
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:37,850
you can work with insurance companies

125
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,040
the opportunities are really endless you

126
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,550
can also do so many things to advance

127
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,200
your career

128
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:44,030
I will definitely always a hundred

129
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,520
percent be working as a nurse in some

130
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:48,560
capacity or another it just might look a

131
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,840
little bit different than it did before

132
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,240
are you actually happy or is it just a

133
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,250
front that you put up I actually get

134
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:58,370
this question quite frequently because I

135
00:04:55,250 --> 00:05:00,260
think I look pretty positive online and

136
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:02,000
if you meet me in person you'll realize

137
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:04,100
that I'm pretty pretty similar I'm a

138
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,889
little bit more sarcastic I'm a little

139
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:09,710
bit more savage in person but otherwise

140
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:11,419
my personality is pretty similar I will

141
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:13,580
say that depending on who I'm hanging

142
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:16,430
out with I definitely match their energy

143
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:18,260
level so if you're like a super outgoing

144
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:20,060
happy person then I'll match you on that

145
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:22,580
energy level and if you're like quiet

146
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:25,010
and more reserved then I'm also going to

147
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:28,070
act like that and I'll say that I have

148
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:31,580
been happier in this last month in 2020

149
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:32,450
a that I have been in a very very very

150
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,850
long time

151
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:38,510
so and I've been going to the gym every

152
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:40,340
day like Who am I 2020 new year new me

153
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:44,900
how do you balance your career in

154
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:48,310
nursing and on YouTube this is a great

155
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:51,289
question I think you know there is

156
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:53,510
always time to do the things that you're

157
00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:55,280
really passionate about right you make

158
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:57,110
time for the things that matter and for

159
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,750
me making content is something that

160
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:01,880
makes me so so happy and I love sharing

161
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:03,410
my journey with you guys and so that's

162
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:06,110
something that's always a priority for

163
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:09,500
me in terms of how I actually block out

164
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:11,600
my time I have a very wonderful Google

165
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,600
Calendar that's pretty loose I don't

166
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,760
always pull my own schedule that I make

167
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,350
but it is really nice because I plan out

168
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,419
like hey I'm working Tuesday Thursday

169
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:22,100
Saturday which means I can film on

170
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:23,400
Wednesday and then do editing on Friday

171
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,570
or whatever it is I do

172
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,550
kind of have to plan it out in advance

173
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:28,560
especially because my schedule can be a

174
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:30,570
little bit more unpredictable tell us a

175
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:34,590
fun fact about you that we would not

176
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:40,560
know fun fact not really like fun person

177
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:42,810
oh I cannot I repeat I cannot in public

178
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,539
comment down below if you are the same

179
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:48,030
way oh my god I have to poop like in my

180
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:50,430
house like on my toilet like you know in

181
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:52,620
the comfort of my home when I'm like

182
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:54,210
traveling I have a hard time pooping so

183
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,310
I think in the last like two years

184
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:58,860
working as a nurse I have pooped at work

185
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:00,720
once because I really couldn't hold it

186
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,639
but otherwise otherwise I'm like

187
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,940
literally cannot what are your

188
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:09,419
insecurities huh I think my biggest

189
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:12,180
insecurity is like my personality I'm

190
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:14,220
like a very introverted person and I can

191
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:18,599
put on a front for a couple of hours for

192
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:21,030
like 3-4 hours but beyond that oh my god

193
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:23,729
I'm like an introvert and so I like to

194
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:26,160
stay at home I'm a homebody and I just

195
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:28,020
like to I really mean my lone time and

196
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,639
the people that I really love and are

197
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:31,410
close with I could spend forever with

198
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:33,180
them but everyone else it's like super

199
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:34,800
exhausting and draining for me to hang

200
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:37,470
out with people so I do wish I was a

201
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:42,030
little bit better at that now we're

202
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:44,460
getting into the relationship tea I got

203
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:48,360
a question asking me why don't you ever

204
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:50,250
share stuff about your relationships so

205
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,190
if you follow me on Instagram I'm gonna

206
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:55,620
Instagram for like 3 years now and I

207
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:58,409
very ever rarely share anything about my

208
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:00,330
personal life and especially not about

209
00:07:58,409 --> 00:08:02,280
my relationships I don't know I think

210
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:05,159
I've just always felt like it's not

211
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:07,199
really my information to share like not

212
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:09,659
everybody wants to be put on blast or be

213
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,520
in the public eye I I'm always scared

214
00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:13,349
because you never know how things can

215
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,479
turn out or what things will happen and

216
00:08:13,349 --> 00:08:17,340
so I don't want to put any information

217
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:20,280
out there and then have it turn out to

218
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,849
be some scandalous info if you guys know

219
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,830
what I mean

220
00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:25,050
but I also feel like my relationships

221
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:28,830
are a really big part of my life and

222
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:30,539
make me who I am and it explains a lot

223
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:32,089
of the like you know the changes that I

224
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:36,409
go through and the emotion

225
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:37,999
that I feel and so I am I am going to

226
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:40,249
start sharing a lot more information

227
00:08:37,999 --> 00:08:42,259
with you guys about what's going on

228
00:08:40,249 --> 00:08:42,680
because it's just such a big part of my

229
00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:45,259
life

230
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,999
so we'll start right now in this video

231
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:49,309
I'm going to answer a couple questions

232
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:53,959
about relationships that I have never

233
00:08:49,309 --> 00:08:55,370
answered before so okay well well so

234
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:58,309
we'll start slowly how many

235
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:59,990
relationships have you been in some of

236
00:08:58,309 --> 00:09:02,569
you guys think I have never been in a

237
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:05,420
relationship but the answer is that I

238
00:09:02,569 --> 00:09:09,110
have been in two relationships they are

239
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:10,939
both really long relationships one was

240
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:14,360
five years and the other one three years

241
00:09:10,939 --> 00:09:16,509
so there's that some juicy tea for you

242
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,579
how old were you when you had your first

243
00:09:16,509 --> 00:09:21,499
romantic relationship so I'm going to

244
00:09:19,579 --> 00:09:23,389
not consider a middle school love

245
00:09:21,499 --> 00:09:26,870
because I don't think that really counts

246
00:09:23,389 --> 00:09:30,379
but my first like actual boyfriend was

247
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:34,309
when I was a freshman in high school and

248
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:36,920
I dated him for five years so yeah all

249
00:09:34,309 --> 00:09:38,990
the way into college into my second year

250
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:43,399
of college what are some deal-breakers

251
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:45,889
for you interesting question it's really

252
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:48,949
funny because I think the type of person

253
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:50,480
that I've liked has always been really

254
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:52,519
similar and I'm like oh I don't have a

255
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,410
type but they all kind of end up being

256
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:56,240
kind of the same I think it's really

257
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:59,689
unattractive to me when people don't

258
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,639
work hard for their goals or they're not

259
00:09:59,689 --> 00:10:04,519
ambitious and don't have like a next set

260
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:06,139
of goals for me at least I am constantly

261
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:08,120
thinking about like how can I be a

262
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:09,559
better person how can I give more what

263
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,809
is the next thing I should be working on

264
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:13,879
and it's really hard for me when the

265
00:10:11,809 --> 00:10:16,129
person that I am in a relationship with

266
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:18,980
or were to be in a relationship with

267
00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:20,720
isn't also like that like they need to

268
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:22,429
like also have the same mindset if that

269
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:27,199
makes sense most was just like not a

270
00:10:22,429 --> 00:10:28,550
huge fan of like facial hair I don't

271
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:31,600
know personal preference

272
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:33,769
were you a popular girl in high school

273
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,579
Hey look no one from my high school is

274
00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:39,470
watching this so I definitely like

275
00:10:37,579 --> 00:10:41,480
peaked in middle school middle school

276
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:44,040
was when I felt like a very very cool

277
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:46,920
person like all the boys liked me

278
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,360
I was like this very extroverted person

279
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,089
who was like friends with everyone I

280
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,470
said hi to everyone and then when I got

281
00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:54,120
to high school I think that was so

282
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:57,329
stressed trying to apply for college

283
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,740
that I had zero energy to pretend to be

284
00:10:57,329 --> 00:11:00,720
this like extroverted person that I

285
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:05,190
actually wasn't and so when I got to

286
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:07,470
high school um pretty much like the same

287
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:09,389
couple of people I definitely spent a

288
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:10,680
lot of my brunches and lunches just in

289
00:11:09,389 --> 00:11:13,290
the hospital trying to catch up on

290
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,970
homework and studying I was just really

291
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:17,610
nervous that I was not gonna get into

292
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:19,709
college at all and so all of my time and

293
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:23,009
energy was focused towards that how has

294
00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:25,410
it been adjusting to your new jobs thank

295
00:11:23,009 --> 00:11:28,529
you for asking it's been really really

296
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:30,029

298
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:34,380

299
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:37,170
are pretty rough but now that I'm past

300
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:39,660

304
00:11:43,709 --> 00:11:48,000
