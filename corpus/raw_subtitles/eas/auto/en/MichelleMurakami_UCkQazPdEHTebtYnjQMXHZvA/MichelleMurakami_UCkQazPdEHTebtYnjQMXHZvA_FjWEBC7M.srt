4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,800

q a so i did a little story on

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,600
instagram and i asked people to send me

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,480
questions

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,840
about youtube and twitch and just like

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,079
social media in general i guess

13
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,840
um and so

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,600

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,680
and there are some things that i did

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,000
want to talk about

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,520
um that have like come up within the

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,120

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,800

23
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,559
come sit down and we're just going to

24
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,719
chat today

25
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,480
all right so first question um would you

26
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,399
do a collab with any other youtubers or

27
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,520
twitch streamers um

28
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:04,559
i have done collabs with other youtubers

29
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,119
specifically girls that went to ucla

30
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,439
with me

31
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,479
uh there were four of us that pretty

32
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,119
consistently did

33
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,799
youtube around the same time and our

34
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,560
content was kind of the same

35
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,000
and if you guys want to watch that then

36
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,600
i will link it up here

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,439
basically we did a podcast it was

38
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,960
supposed to be a four series but then it

39
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,600
was a lot of work

40
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,560
so we only did one episode but it was

41
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,680
basically

42
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:30,000
what you would talk about or teach

43
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,000
younger people that are going to ucla

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,560
like advice that you would give them

45
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,840
so that one came out um i did that with

46
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,040
alice

47
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,600
nia elaine and

48
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,520
i so the four of us did that and

49
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,119
honestly i really liked it like i loved

50
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,960
getting different personalities and

51
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,720
different people's opinions on certain

52
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,520
things like not just my own

53
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,880
so that was really fun so for twitch

54
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,399
streaming i'm a little bit

55
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,960
newer so i haven't done

56
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,159
i don't know if squad streaming is only

57
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,560
for partners but

58
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,840
i haven't done like a collab with any

59
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,439
other twitch streamers yet

60
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,679
um i just i'm pretty small and so

61
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,599
you know i think the time will come when

62
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,720
like i will get the opportunity to do it

63
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,280
but i just don't

64
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,720
i don't like have that exposure yet so i

65
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,599
haven't done it but i'm really down to

66
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,599
do it like i'm down to

67
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,599
play games with other streamers or like

68
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,200
i i usually do play with other people

69
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,120
but sometimes like we're either

70
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,640
like neither of us is streaming or one

71
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,480
of us is streaming so

72
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,280
um yeah that's definitely something like

73
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,080
to plan for but i am down for that

74
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,160
um question number two the hardest part

75
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,080
about doing it

76
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,200
there's a lot that comes along with this

77
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,519
question

78
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:48,640
um consistency criticism

79
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:52,080
um and just kind of being okay with

80
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,560
sharing your private life and you know

81
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,519
having people judge that and i think

82
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,080
that

83
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,760
for someone like me i am definitely i'm

84
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,560
like two people in one i'm very

85
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,000
sensitive

86
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,000
but i'm also very like i don't give a

87
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,760
 what people think but i am also

88
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,280
sensitive so like it does bother me if

89
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,319
people like have something to say about

90
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,200
it but like

91
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,519
at the same time like my mental is like

92
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,680
okay this is gonna make me like a

93
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,840
like a stronger person it's gonna make

94
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,599
me not care about these comments right

95
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:26,720
uh consistency because i have recently

96
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,640
run into like burning out um

97
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,000
and that was from twitch and so i was

98
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,959
streaming

99
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,760
probably every other day consistently

100
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,799
for a while

101
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,959
and then um recently like

102
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,920
two or three weeks ago i just got this

103
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,760
like

104
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,920
feeling that i just didn't want to

105
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,040
stream like i didn't want to socialize

106
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,840
i didn't want to have people like look

107
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,959
at me on

108
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,760
camera and i stopped streaming for like

109
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,200
a

110
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,200
like almost a week or more uh and then

111
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,799
now i've been streaming probably once

112
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,319
every four days

113
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,319
and so it's been really hard to get back

114
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:05,280
into it because

115
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:07,200
right now i'm thinking like i just want

116
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,959
a chill night like i watch people stream

117
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,560
and i'm popping the chats and everything

118
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,560
and like i just want to have a chill

119
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,120
night with my friends and

120
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,239
you know relax watch some anime watch a

121
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,799
movie

122
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,000
play some valor in and i it like makes

123
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,400
me really happy

124
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,160
but then at the same at the same time

125
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,759
there are days when i miss it i'm like

126
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,199
man like i really want to talk with my

127
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,280
chat i want to see what they're like up

128
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,040
to like i just want to catch up so those

129
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,240
are the days that i do stream

130
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,000
um but yeah hardest part consistency

131
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,919
consistency is everything with both of

132
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,360
these platforms like the algorithm

133
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,880
really works with you if you're on a

134
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,919
consistent schedule

135
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,400
um criticism because

136
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,280
you know you need to have like a strong

137
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,320
mental for this

138
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,520
strong mental and sometimes creativity

139
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,479
like the three c's

140
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,160
uh you need to think of new ideas like

141
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,280
so that people don't get bored or like

142
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,040
if you know that

143
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,720
this kind of content isn't working then

144
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,160
you have to try another thing like

145
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:07,120
planning filming timing hair makeup

146
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,759
outfit it's just a lot sometimes but you

147
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,000
know

148
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,440
i enjoy it what's the weirdest

149
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,440
interaction that you've had with

150
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:19,199
chats and comments weirdest interaction

151
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:22,320
there have been a few mostly from twitch

152
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:25,360
um i've gotten like

153
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,360
are you free february 14th that's

154
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,400
you know it's not weird it's just kind

155
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,840
of

156
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:34,240
uh okay i had one guy say like

157
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,960
can you do that ahegao face and i was

158
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,000
like what the

159
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,000
 is i go and then i looked it up and

160
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,199
it's some like japanese

161
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
porn stuff and like i'm like okay i'm

162
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,120
banning you

163
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,240
so then i banned him um

164
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,280
another thing i think something that's

165
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,560
consistently

166
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:58,160
a little bit weird for me is

167
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:01,360
when people that i don't know

168
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:04,479
ask to play and it's like i'm the kind

169
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,600
of person where i feel bad if i say no

170
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,000
and like that was me at the very

171
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,039
beginning i'd be like oh yeah

172
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,880
like i'm down like we can

173
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:17,280
um maybe like after this game and then

174
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,800
after that game i like end stream

175
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,319
because i would forget that i had

176
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,520
something like i had to play with

177
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,960
someone but like

178
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,720
i didn't actually want to play with them

179
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,120
like one i don't know you two

180
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,479
like i don't yeah i don't know like it

181
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,280
might be awkward

182
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,400
um and so that's something that i really

183
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,280
struggle with

184
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,919
um something also that was hard was that

185
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,479
like

186
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,919
when i did play with a viewer and i was

187
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,880
ranking

188
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,479
we just were not on the same level like

189
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,000
we weren't in the same rank

190
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:49,440
like my friends and i like

191
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,960

192
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,720
kind of knew what we were doing but like

193
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,000
this person like

194
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,560

195
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,840
and like

196
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,840

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,400
play unrated with you like that's fine

201
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,599

202
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,919
happen again

203
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,360

kim

256
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,399
her vlogs are just everything i was far

257
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,600
to do in korea like i just want to live

258
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,880
in korea

259
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,240
soon someday uh next one if you had to

260
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,920
choose one game to play for the rest of

261
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,760
your life what would it be

262
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,800
and i'm going to say this because i've

263
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:18,240
spent way too much money on this game

264
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,720
and all my friends played valerian

265
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,240
i've spent probably almost 500 on this

266
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,240
free game

267
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,440
don't come for me because i love my

268
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:30,640
skins they're so nice they're so pretty

269
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,320
yeah now uh

270
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,160
next question this has nothing to do

271
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,440
with the topic but it's a very

272
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,519
interesting question so

273
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,279
would you date a poor great looking guy

274
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,680
or a rich ugly guy

275
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,839
if we're excluding personality and the

276
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,399
way he treats me and just morals in

277
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,399
general

278
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,920
you know that's a hard one because i

279
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,320
really take morals and

280
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,600
personality as a big thing like it

281
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,959
doesn't matter how much money you have

282
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,320
if you're like a good guy and then

283
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,440
you're like really nice to me and you're

284
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,320
really sweet

285
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,880
like genuine like nothing else matters

286
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,640
but

287
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,800
i guess i would date the rich ugly

288
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,959
looking guy because i'm not

289
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,399
not superficial but then again i am

290
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,640
materialistic in that way

291
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,360
so that's a double-edged sword i feel

292
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,519
like i lost either way if i answered

293
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,120
um what made you want to start streaming

294
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,720
or creating content

295
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,320
i feel like i've always been a very

296
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,440
creative person

297
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,200
i've always loved making stuff so when i

298
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,560
was younger it was like drawing

299
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,480
it was paintings stuff like that

300
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,680
when i got into high school i would

301
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,040
watch vlogs

302
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:39,279
because i i watched vlogs

303
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,600
of college like what it's like to be in

304
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,279
college what it's like to go to ucla

305
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,560
and that was when i was really depressed

306
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,000
because that was something that like

307
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,760
kept me going it like made

308
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
me want to do something with my life

309
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,959
um and so when i got into college i was

310
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,880
like you know what i'm going to make

311
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,680
this video because like i want people to

312
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,519
see

313
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,440
what my life is like i want to document

314
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,959
things so that i can look back on it

315
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,800
so you know his memories for me it was

316
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,880
memories for other people it was just

317
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,079
information for the people i love making

318
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,240
content like

319
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,839
i love putting myself out there and for

320
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,800
people to get to know me

321
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,600
um that's where my enfj comes out but my

322
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,120
infj

323
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,560
that i sometimes test as um

324
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,920
you know it's kind of like i don't want

325
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,079
people to judge me i don't want people

326
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,959
to see how many like flaws i have but

327
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,720
you know

328
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,880
i feel like that comes along with it so

329
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,240
it's like you know i'm accepting

330
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:33,600
how perfectly imperfect i am and that's

331
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:36,160
perfectly fine with me so but

332
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,519
creating content i i just love it in

333
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,920
general like i

334
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,519
went to twitch because youtube was just

335
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,720
so slow at the time like i

336
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,360
didn't have i didn't have content to

337
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,839
make

338
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,600
and i wanted to do something and twitch

339
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,560

344
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,519
both worlds

345
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,440
um what do you value in friendship and

346
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,639
what can you see it being valuable in

347
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,399
the future

348
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:12,160
honesty realness

349
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:14,000
sense of humor um

350
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,360
you know being down to earth and i feel

351
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,360
like if we vibe

352
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,519
then you know it'll work like if we're

353
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,440
just being very genuine with each other

354
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,959
like if you're

355
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,720
trying to be friends with me for the

356
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,800
same reason that i am like just

357
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,320
like for friendship not to like gain

358
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,839
anything from it

359
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,920
then you know that's a healthy

360
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,040
relationship but um

361
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,360
you know if you're in it for other

362
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,320
reasons and like i find out the hard way

363
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,000
then

364
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,800
but what can i see being valuable in the

365
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
future honestly like

366
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:46,560
i make friends just to like if

367
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,360
like my friends that i've made recently

368
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,200
are

369
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,959
honestly kind of like my family like

370
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,800
where we tell each other things like we

371
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,399
come each other we come to each other

372
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,160
when we have problems

373
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,519
um you know we're there for each other

374
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,120
like when we're having a bad day we're

375
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,680
not having a good day we hype each other

376
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,680
up like

377
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,079
it's honestly like probably the

378
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,560
healthiest thing that i've found

379
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,240
and not everyone that you meet online is

380
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:12,079
going to have that same intention

381
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,839
and i have learned that the hard way so

382
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:16,079
what inspired you to get into these

383
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:21,360
platforms

384
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:24,000
youtube um i was watching at the time

385
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,920
i think i was watching wally tv i'm

386
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,760
pretty sure i was watching walleye tv

387
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,959
because there weren't very many vloggers

388
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,839
around that time

389
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,519
and you know i was like you know what

390
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,600
this is really cool but like

391
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,200
i'm nobody nobody's going to want want

392
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,040
to watch my life like

393
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,639
my life is not interesting when you

394
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,519
think about it it's kind of like

395
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,120
these people started the same way like

396
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,199
they had a passion for something

397
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,199
they didn't really have anything you

398
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:51,199
know to offer besides their experience

399
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:54,399
and what they're bringing to the world

400
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:56,800
and because they were real with it

401
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,839
you know it works and so it's kind of

402
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,839
like the same thing if you have

403
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,440
consistency if you're

404
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,720
you know passionate about what you're

405
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,560
doing people are going to see that and

406
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,320
they're going to want to watch it

407
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:10,399
but for twitch um you know i saw i was

408
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,880
watching jessica for a while

409
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,160
um i had no intention of streaming

410
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,040
because i didn't think

411
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,440
that i was i had the personality for it

412
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,279
uh

413
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:24,399
two i didn't have a pc at the time

414
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:26,320
and so when i did build my pc i was like

415
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,720
you know i am terrible at games i have

416
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,560
never played an fps in my life

417
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,839
i don't know how to do this like no one

418
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,079
is going to want to watch me

419
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,199
but as i started to stream more and i

420
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,839
started to like

421
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:39,279
you know gain viewers it wasn't about

422
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,760
how good i was at the game

423
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,560
because they can watch professionals do

424
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,360
this

425
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,639
any time of the day and so the reason

426
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,519
why they were watching me

427
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,279
is like for my personality and for you

428
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,480
know having conversations with me and my

429
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,240
chat and people in there

430
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,320
and seeing the friends in there and so

431
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,839
that was kind of like the best part

432
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:03,120
um and so i think it was initially

433
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,279
a jessica stream that made me want to

434
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,880
start streaming

435
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:10,839
um so a last topic that i wanted to talk

436
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,720
about

437
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:17,199
was i just like

438
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:20,399
something that bothered me was

439
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:23,600
i think going back to the topic of

440
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:27,279
criticism and being judged um

441
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:29,440
i have no problem taking criticism

442
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,800
from people that you know have

443
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,759
experience in this like if you know what

444
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,199
you're doing

445
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,040
and you're like you know like you could

446
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,240
really fix some of these things blah

447
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,399
blah blah

448
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,320
that's fine i'm gonna be like i have no

449
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,240
idea what i'm really doing i'm winging

450
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,279
it i've been winging it for like

451
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,360
three years and i've been on here um but

452
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:50,560
if you're going to

453
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,920

454
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,920
she doing like

455
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,360
like why the is it taking her this

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,839
long to do this like

457
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,279

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,560

459
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:04,800
