00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:51,300
channel I am so glad you're here

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,160
welcome I'm sure you'll get to know me a

21
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,780
little bit better through this video for

22
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,610
obvious reasons because I'll be

23
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,070
answering questions about myself and my

24
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:01,230
channel and if you like what you see I

25
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,420
invite you to join the breath of beauty

26
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:06,119
family because we really are a good

27
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,760
bunch here alright let's get on with the

28
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:10,740
tag okay so I have the questions here on

29
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,810
my phone so I apologize if I'm looking

30
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,780
down but that is what I'm looking at

31
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:21,060
right here so the first question is what

32
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:24,119
inspired you to start making videos so I

33
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,909
had made other channels in the past and

34
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:29,119
made other videos in the past but they

35
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:32,909
quickly flopped because I didn't really

36
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:35,340
have the grit behind you know what it

37
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:37,680
takes to make videos and consistently

38
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,500
create content finally this year I

39
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,869
decided to make videos now I have faced

40
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,850
a lot of opposition from my family

41
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:46,380
regarding making videos for some reason

42
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,180
they were just really against it so

43
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,520
that's another reason why I didn't

44
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,590
really keep up making YouTube videos but

45
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,899
when I became a working adult an

46
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,090
independent adult that can make her own

47
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:00,689
decisions and like live her own life

48
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:03,270
without feeling obligated to obey other

49
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:07,110
people who because of financial

50
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:09,229
dependency for example I decided hey

51
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:11,350
I've always wanted to make videos

52
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:13,300
relating to beauty

53
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:17,140
I really fell in love with beauty like

54
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:20,260
middle school souls pretty young age and

55
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:22,000
it just was so interested and I really

56
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:25,990
really wanted to create my own beauty

57
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,830
content so April of this year I finally

58
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:32,260
decided to make videos and the

59
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:36,190
inspiration just comes from me loving to

60
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:38,020
create content I'm a creator and also my

61
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:39,070
love of beauty products and all things

62
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,900
related to beauty

63
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:44,260
not just outer beauty but inner beauty

64
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:46,360
as well okay second question is how long

65
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:48,340
have you been on YouTube and have you

66
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,200
had other channels I kind of already

67
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:53,590
touched on this and the first question

68
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:56,770
yes I've had other channels and this

69
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:58,450
current channel I've had since April so

70
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:01,810
I'm not very long a little over six

71
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:03,880
months I'd say it's pretty young so I'm

72
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:07,060
still really proud of it I'm honestly

73
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:10,000
pretty surprised at myself for keeping

74
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:12,100
it up all this time I'm kind of and

75
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,300
notorious for being really passionate

76
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:16,180
about something and then like really

77
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:20,500
getting sick of it soon after but this

78
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:23,200
has stuck and I have the perseverance so

79
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:25,690
far in creating content every week and I

80
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,760
don't plan to stop anytime soon and I've

81
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:29,470
been loving it it's been so great

82
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,960
getting to know some of the guys and

83
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:34,450
like creating a lot of friends that are

84
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:37,090
really interested in makeup just as I am

85
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:40,240
so it's been really awesome okay so

86
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:42,310
question number three where do you see

87
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:46,480
yourself and your YouTube channel in

88
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:50,860
five years you know I've never really

89
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:53,410
been good at like long term planning and

90
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:55,990
I consider five years down the line long

91
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:58,120
term planning and I honestly don't

92
00:03:55,990 --> 00:04:00,880
really see a point and trying to plan

93
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,490
out your life personally because I know

94
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,590
most of its not gonna happen and I'm

95
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:08,590
just gonna let God do whatever he wants

96
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:12,250
to do to guide me through out though I

97
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:15,010
guess next 5 10 20 30 years of my life

98
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:18,310
and so I don't really make it a point of

99
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:22,870
like planning everything but if I'm just

100
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:25,180
daydreaming and five years I'll be 30 so

101
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:27,100
hopefully I don't know I

102
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:31,210
might be having thoughts about having a

103
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:32,830
child like a kid I might be having

104
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:36,970
another dollar which I was all excited

105
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:41,979
about like I really want another dog and

106
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:45,009
in five years I don't know um in terms

107
00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:47,979
of my youtube channel I have no idea

108
00:04:45,009 --> 00:04:51,250
honestly um I have made a commitment to

109
00:04:47,979 --> 00:04:53,650
myself when I started this channel that

110
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:57,220
I would keep doing what I'm doing for

111
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:59,080
three years at least and you guys that's

112
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,820
actually a pretty long time for me

113
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,580
because like I said I get sick of things

114
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:05,139
super super fast and this is really

115
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,780
different like I'm really passionate

116
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:10,210
about it and I'm really trying to keep

117
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:13,270
it up and just keep the passion going

118
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:15,340
and persevere through the hard times or

119
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:17,229
like the slumps and I've been really

120
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:21,070
enjoying it so far it's been quite a

121
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:23,889
ride already so um I know I'm gonna keep

122
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:25,990
it up for at least three years and if I

123
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:28,539
keep it up for five years that'd be so

124
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:30,580
awesome and maybe even more than five

125
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:32,199
years who knows right who knows what

126
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:35,289
youtube is gonna be like in five years

127
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:38,530
but um I don't really have like a

128
00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:40,510
subscriber number and mine or or video

129
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:42,940
views of mine cuz that's not we leave

130
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:45,639
that important to me what really matters

131
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,960
to me is that through my videos and

132
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:50,680
through my channel

133
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:54,070
somebody will really be able to see that

134
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:57,669
they are beautiful like that if I'm able

135
00:05:54,070 --> 00:06:03,159
to make one person feel like they are

136
00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:05,650
really truly beautiful then what more

137
00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:08,320
can I think yeah I honestly feel like

138
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:12,130
yeah if I'm able to be a positive

139
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:15,340
influence on a number of people in five

140
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:18,849
years that's all I would want honestly

141
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:20,409
question number four what message are

142
00:06:18,849 --> 00:06:22,479
you trying to get across with your

143
00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:23,020
videos so I guess I touched on this one

144
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,930
too

145
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:27,909
but the biggest and most important

146
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:30,669
message that I'm trying to get across

147
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:37,139
through my videos is that you the viewer

148
00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:38,620
are truly magnificent beautiful and

149
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:42,550
wonderful

150
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:45,940
that is the number one message that I

151
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:48,820
want you the viewer to hear from me and

152
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:53,169
now I say this because I'm a Christian

153
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:56,199
and that is the most integral part of my

154
00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:58,780
life that is my life and I think the

155
00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:01,870
most important thing is for people to

156
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:04,860
see themselves as how God sees them and

157
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:08,740
that's loved beautiful wonderful

158
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:10,630
accepted amazing a work of art like

159
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:13,449
that's how I won't be able to view

160
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:17,080
themselves and that's the most important

161
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:19,270
message that I want to get across to you

162
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,729
guys through my videos and that's why at

163
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:23,380
the end of every single one of my videos

164
00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:25,360
I will tell you that you guys are

165
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,710
beautiful you're wonderful and I'm so

166
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,660
grateful that you guys are my friends

167
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:31,090
because that's truly how I feel

168
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:34,150
and I hope you guys really know that

169
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:36,430
that's really sincerely from my heart is

170
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:39,100
I feel like you guys are really

171
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:41,919
beautiful and you're amazing humans each

172
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:44,050
and every one of you are unique each and

173
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,870
every one of you are loved each and

174
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:49,419
every one of you are awesome and that's

175
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:51,460
what I want to get across otherwise

176
00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:54,160
another message I want to get across is

177
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:55,930
that I really love beauty I just want to

178
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,150
share my thoughts on certain products

179
00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:00,520
and I just want to talk about makeup

180
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:02,500
with fellow Beauty enthusiasts and if I

181
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,229
get to help any beginners along the way

182
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:08,830
that's awesome you know so that's that

183
00:08:05,229 --> 00:08:12,300
question number five is do people from

184
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:12,300
school find your channel

185
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:17,850
I don't think so I'm I'm pretty small

186
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:20,280
still so I don't think people from

187
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:22,980
school find me I guess if they're like

188
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:26,460
friends and they see me like I suggested

189
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:28,770
on their Instagram feed or something and

190
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:30,419
they follow me and that's how they find

191
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:33,030
out about my channel I can't really do

192
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:35,310
anything about that but I do kind of

193
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:37,020
like to keep my channel a little private

194
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:39,780
when it comes to my friends like only

195
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:42,599
like a handful of my close friends know

196
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:44,520
about my channel otherwise like I don't

197
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:46,170
go around broadcasting and telling

198
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,570
people I have a youtube channel cuz it's

199
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:51,089
like so precious and then still mine and

200
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:54,260
like I don't really feel like going

201
00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:58,800
around telling everybody that I do this

202
00:08:54,260 --> 00:09:01,830
so yeah question number six is what does

203
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,080
your username mean and so I think it's

204
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:07,740
pretty straightforward my username is

205
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:10,020
breath of beauty and when I was first

206
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:13,460
starting out you know creating this

207
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:16,530
channel I kind of envisioned that this

208
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:19,880
channel my my videos would be a place

209
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:23,490
where you guys can come and just take a

210
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:26,610
breath of beauty right like taking a

211
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:29,580
breath of fresh air you just take a

212
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:32,160
breath of beauty and I guess that's just

213
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:34,830
really resonated with me and I really

214
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,010
liked how it sounded and just kind of

215
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:40,040
sounds like refreshing and revitalizing

216
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:42,300
you know your passion for makeup or

217
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,640
revitalizing your passion for making

218
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:47,339
creative looks or stepping out of your

219
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:52,530
comfort zone or even just taking a

220
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:54,450
breath of beauty to know and be reminded

221
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:56,190
that you are beautiful because you need

222
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:58,290
reminders like let's be honest we're all

223
00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:00,570
humans and we have negative thoughts

224
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:02,280
that more often than not creep into your

225
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:03,839
minds and that makes us feel like we're

226
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:06,600
not beautiful or makes us feel like

227
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,640
we're not worthy but if you have

228
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,860
reminders telling you the truth

229
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,930
which is that you're beautiful it can be

230
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:15,990
incredibly helpful so you're taking this

231
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:18,330
breadth of this revitalizing passion for

232
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:21,660
makeup as well as you're taking a like a

233
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:23,340
freshening reset breath to let yourself

234
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:25,350
be reminded that you're

235
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:27,540
beautiful does that make sense just feel

236
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:30,600
like I'm just being so abstract but it

237
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:36,390
makes sense in my mind okay number seven

238
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:38,370
is favorite small youtuber now I I don't

239
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:40,800
really know if I have like a favorite

240
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:43,410
small youtuber yet because I've only

241
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,750
just started watching like the smaller

242
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:49,230
youtubers I guess I've been watching

243
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:50,490
like the og youtubers since I was in the

244
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:52,950
middle school and I've kind of like

245
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:55,620
stuck with people that I found and they

246
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:57,570
just end up growing like humongous and

247
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,310
they just end up being huge but I guess

248
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:03,570
they were small youtubers when I started

249
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:04,920
watching them so yeah currently I do not

250
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:07,800
have them but I'm sure I'll have one

251
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:12,120
soon okay so that's all of the questions

252
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:14,190
