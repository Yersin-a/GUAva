4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,120
i thought i would vlog today because

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,640
it's a super busy day

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,080
i think it's going to be super packed so

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,520
i'll have more stuff to share with you

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,000
guys but anyways

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,519
this morning my day started super early

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,960
usually i don't have meetings on my

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,400
calendar until

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,960
like maybe 10-ish but today i actually

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,760
had

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,640
two meetings back to back i had an eight

15
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,719
to nine am

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,239
and then a nine to ten a.m basically as

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,320
many of you guys know i work as a

18
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,840
marketing manager and part of my job

19
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,960
is to oversee sustainability so

20
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,600
um we're part of a few

21
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,440
industry groups and within the industry

22
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,520
there's a lot of different

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,719
organizations that you can take part of

24
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,399
and they host a lot of different

25
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,160
webinars and updates

26
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,960
so those first two meetings in the

27
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,120
morning because basically it's

28
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,079
global so they have to find a time that

29
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,559
works for

30
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,760
everyone across the world so um i had

31
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,520
one at 8am and then the other one at 9am

32
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,799
and i was just like listening and doing

33
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,479
my makeup so

34
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,640
thankfully i just took the time to get

35
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,640
ready i actually just got a package so

36
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,360
i'm gonna go open that right now

37
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,479
so exciting i just got this box from

38
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,040
skintay

39
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,680
and i've been wanting to try all their

40
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,640
drinks because i love sparkling drinks

41
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,439
and

42
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,040
it has collagen which is a plus plus if

43
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,240
you're over 25 which i

44
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,320
am i'm 25 right now basically your

45
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,640
collagen production starts to decrease

46
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,439
and collagen is essential for healthy

47
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,000
glowing

48
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,600
youthful skin so i'm so excited they

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,479
sent this to me let me show you guys

50
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,280
what

51
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,920
what i got so they sent me this box with

52
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,040
a sampler of their green tea grapefruit

53
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,520
white tea ginger

54
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,159
and hibiscus vanilla i think i'm really

55
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,240
excited to try these too but in general

56
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,520
all of them sound so good and then they

57
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,560
sent me a six pack

58
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,399
of the green tea grapefruit which i

59
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,560
think sounds like my favorite flavor

60
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,319
so i'm really excited to try these i'll

61
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,520
probably have one in the afternoon

62
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:13,920

63
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,480

67
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,599
also i love that the packaging is i

68
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,120

to change now

84
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,720
or maybe a little bit later i just

85
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,720
it's been hard for me to get out of my

86
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,640
little comfy clothes

87
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,879

[Music]

115
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:19,359
when i hit go ground so i moved out here

116
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,079
so that i could actually have a standing

117
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,639
set up

118
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,160
um one of my co-workers inspired me to

119
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,000
start standing more

120
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,440
and i don't have a standing desk so i'm

121
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,080
just standing at this island

122
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,000
in our kitchen um but i wanted to show

123
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:36,000
you guys

124
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:42,400
i'm gonna try this i'm so excited

125
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:45,520
let's see how it tastes

126
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,520
it tastes so good

127
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,639
it literally just tastes like sometimes

128
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,840
at boba places i'll order their

129
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,840
grapefruit green tea

130
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,080
it literally tastes like that but

131
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,000
sparkling

132
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,680
so i spent most of this afternoon

133
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,400
prepping for this one meeting i was

134
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,280
leading

135
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,280
i just got out of that and um for the

136
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,479
rest of the afternoon i have emails to

137
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,520

144
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,400
