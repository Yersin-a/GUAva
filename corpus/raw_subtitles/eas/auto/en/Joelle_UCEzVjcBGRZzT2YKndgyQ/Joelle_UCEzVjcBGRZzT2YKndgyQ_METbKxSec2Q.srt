[Music]

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,589
what's up you guys it's Joelle and

3
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:10,290
welcome back to my channel

4
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:12,090
today I'm starting a new series on my

5
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,980
channel that I want to start for quite a

6
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:16,230
while I'm going to be calling it the

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,359
best life and this was inspired by Amy

8
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,100
vagabonds the am with Amy where it's

9
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,230
basically like a get ready with me kind

10
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,789
of situation but she also just talks he

11
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,439
talks about things that she's interested

12
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:28,019
in and stuff that she's been thinking

13
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,150
about lately and can address topics that

14
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:31,500
you guys requested and stuff like that

15
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,600
so I wanted a format where I could

16
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,329
combine my love for beauty and makeup

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,649
and all of that with just the deeper

18
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:39,030
things because for all of you makeup

19
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:41,430
lovers I know that there is a lot of

20
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,800
multidimensionality behind what goes on

21
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:45,510
on your face so I just wanted to provide

22
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,879
a space for that here on YouTube since I

23
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,379
feel like a lot of times you know beauty

24
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:51,449
gurus can kind of get relegated to only

25
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:52,559
doing you know beauty cuz of course

26
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:55,320
that's what they're good at but I

27
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,120
personally love hearing about what

28
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,350
people are thinking about and just

29
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,690
what's going on between their ears

30
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,640
behind all of the stuff that is just

31
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:05,729
seen on camera the turtle of this series

32
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,280
the best life is inspired by a verse out

33
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:10,680
of proverbs 3 that I love it's how

34
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,600
verses 3 to flourish and from the

35
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,310
passion translation it reads let your

36
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,869
life be shaped by integrity with truth

37
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,580
written upon your heart that's how

38
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:19,229
you'll find favor and understanding us

39
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,229
both God and men and you will gain the

40
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:23,610
reputation of living life well and

41
00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:26,130
personally that is something that I

42
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:28,890
would love is to be known for living

43
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,420
life well and so a lot of the topics

44
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,430
that I'm going to be discussing in this

45
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,710
series are just you know the everyday

46
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,840
topics of being a human on this planet

47
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:39,390
and figuring out how to live our best

48
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,939
lives so for my first episode I decided

49
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:44,159
to really pay tribute to Amy and do her

50
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:46,979
Asian American tag which she started

51
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,750
this past spring I want to say as so I'm

52
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:50,280

00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:10,759
shadow base to get started and her first

63
00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:14,030
question is what ethnicity are you and I

64
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:16,880
am Chinese Korean American my mom is

65
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:19,670
Chinese my dad is Korean for eyeshadow

66
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,590
I'm getting into my Too Faced just

67
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:24,050
peachy mattes palette that my sister

68
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:25,160
mica got me thank you very much mica and

69
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:27,980
this is gonna be your just a really

70
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:30,050
summery everyday peachy look so I'm

71
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,940
using peach tea I'm gonna use that all

72
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:33,950
over my lid and the next question is

73
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:37,010
what generation are you and I am

74
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:39,380
technically second-generation my dad

75
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:43,610
moved to the States from Seoul Korea

76
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:44,269
when he was six but since he grew up in

77
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,950
the States

78
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:49,280
he's considered like first generation

79
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:50,690
American I believe I don't Christ me on

80
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,880
that if I'm wrong and my mom is also

81
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:56,390
first generation because she was born in

82
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:59,090
the States because her parents moved

83
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:01,640
here from China when they were around

84
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:04,430
college-aged next I'm gonna get into

85
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,380
peach punch and I'm gonna put this on

86
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:08,420
the outer half of my lids okay question

87
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:09,500
number three is what is the first

88
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,209
experience where you felt the

89
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:15,260
demarcation of being a minority or

90
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:18,019
different and I would say I knew all

91
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:20,510
along that I was considered a minority

92
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:22,130
because my parents would mention it when

93
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:24,260
they talked about why we settled down in

94
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:25,880
San Francisco is that my mom wanted us

95
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,650
to grow up in a place where we wouldn't

96
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,180
really have to experience as much racism

97
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:31,040
growing up I think I really felt it

98
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:34,040
regarding to my like specifically

99
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,230
regarding to my race in high school I

100
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,030
went to the same elementary school from

101
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,500
like second grade to eighth grade but

102
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:40,760
when I went to high school I was when I

103
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,290
was you know kind of cognizant enough

104
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,780
and I was gonna be around new people

105
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:46,730
and my sister had already begun at that

106
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,079
high school and she was telling you

107
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:50,239
about like the social groups and how

108
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:52,579
there was like how people would self

109
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,950
separate segregate and there is like a

110
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:57,079
group of the cool cool Asians and then

111
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:59,480
the nerdy Asians literally like Mean

112
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:02,030
Girls and I was like well how do I get

113
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:03,200
to be with like the cool Asians like

114
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:05,060
what's the difference between being a

115
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,859
cool Asian a nerdy Asian like I don't

116
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,840
really know what that means and she's

117
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:11,840
like well like the nerdy is like kind of

118
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:14,510
quiet they're like pretty book smart and

119
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,090
just keep to themselves and with that I

120
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,980
did

121
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,989
super self-conscious as I began to say

122
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:20,489
that high school because I was like oh

123
00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:22,049
no people are just gonna take one look

124
00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:24,600
at me and IRA me like she's a nerdy

125
00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:26,669
Asian cuz I was a nerdy I was very nerdy

126
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,590
in middle school and I just felt like

127
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:30,780
people are going to pinpoint me from the

128
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:33,330
very beginning as being super quiet and

129
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:35,400
never give me the chance to become one

130
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:36,960
of their friends I choose this moment

131
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,280
rather than you know that moment in

132
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,830
middle school when someone makes fun of

133
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,449
my lunch or something because I honestly

134
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:45,120
don't think I really put it together

135
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:46,919
that it was because my food was

136
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,960
different or like I was minority than

137
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:50,610
they were laughing I was just like well

138
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,580
that's weird you don't like good food

139
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:55,710
but like whatever but I think it's

140
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:58,350
because I was so lucky to grow up in

141
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:00,120
such a diverse place was that I was with

142
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:02,010
a lot like I literally went to middle

143
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,770
school in downtown Chinatown of San

144
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:07,200
Francisco so like sure people could be

145
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:09,660
rude and be like oh my gosh Oh like what

146
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,430
is that it was literally mon Dieu or pot

147
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:14,699
stickers you can buy them at Costco like

148
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:16,740
come on I literally saw as their problem

149
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:19,110
not mine and I was like okay I'm sorry

150
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,870
like I'll try to make it smell less but

151
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:23,880
I'm still gonna eat it cuz like you live

152
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,710
in San Francisco how can you like how

153
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,850
can you be like this oh yeah I mean just

154
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:29,010
to follow up with like the high school

155
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:31,080
thing thankfully after I got to high

156
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:34,200
school I was like super extra brewed I

157
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:36,660
was like the most talkative like funny

158
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,580
silly bubbly person I tried I could

159
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:40,500
possibly D so that people win it

160
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:43,349
immediately pinpoint me as like a quiet

161
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,940
Asian and like in a weird sad way to be

162
00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:46,979
honest it worked like people likes me

163
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,389
they didn't see me and like delegate me

164
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:50,700
to the group of like quiet Asian girls

165
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:52,530
but I realized later on that I was like

166
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,120
why I being like this like it I of

167
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:56,820
course like I wanted to be close with

168
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,560
everyone and I wanted to be friendly but

169
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:02,039
I realized was coming out of a place of

170
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,200
insecurity of being you know stereotyped

171
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:06,090
incorrectly rather than just being my

172
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,070
like true authentic self and then

173
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,750
throughout the rest of high school from

174
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:11,280
like junior to senior year I was like

175
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,810
you know I'm gonna be friendly but I can

176
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,639
just be myself

177
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:16,860
and relax I don't need to feel like I'm

178
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,450
compensating so in a weird way I wasn't

179
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,770
changing so much what I was doing but it

180
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:21,960
was coming from a different motivation

181
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:23,940
of being authentic and being a good

182
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,469
person rather than trying to make people

183
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,760
see me a certain way and it was so much

184
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:27,930
healthier and I was so much less

185
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,060
exhausted

186
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:32,130
and yeah I was so thankful that it came

187
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,300
to that like revelation Oh another thing

188
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:35,460
that I would do in high school though

189
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,810
was that I would constant like right

190
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,000
starting freshman year oh no super

191
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:41,070
insecure was that I would always make

192
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,080
Asian jokes about myself before

193
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:45,570
something else could like I would assume

194
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:48,330
that if I was talking about my grades or

195
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:49,860
that I play piano I'd be like oh yeah

196
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:52,169
you know cuz I'm Asian so like we just

197
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:55,500
do that and it wasn't till one of my

198
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:57,180
friends who's half Chinese pointed out

199
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,550
and he was like Joe well like why do you

200
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,870
always point it's being Asian like you

201
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:02,430
know people aren't always gonna assume

202
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,680
that you're doing these things cuz

203
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:06,900
you're Asian and it really took him

204
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,520
calling me out to be like oh wow like

205
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,830
I'm internalizing it like this is

206
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,570
internalized racism like I am so afraid

207
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:14,400
of someone making fun of me that I feel

208
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:16,050
the need to make fun of myself and call

209
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,710
myself out for being Asian as if it's a

210
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:18,240
bad thing

211
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:20,880
so they don't have to do it first and

212
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,580
after that I was like I need to stop and

213
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,919
that was really good wake-up call so if

214
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:28,139
you ever see this love you dude thank

215
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,030
you so I put the pink on my lower lash

216
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:32,310
line upper lash line and I think when

217
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:34,050
you say I take peach sangria and use a

218
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:36,360
little bit of it to deepen up the outer

219
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:37,680
corner but next question is were you

220
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,090
always proud of your heritage or was

221
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,710
there a time where you rejected it and I

222
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:44,610
would say at that time in high school

223
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:47,280
when I felt like I am a classic model

224
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:49,110
minority which is a myth for anyone who

225
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,460
hasn't seen Amy's video on this go watch

226
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:53,520
it until one about the model minority

227
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:57,150
myth I felt like I needed to compensate

228
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,770
for me being Asian even though I

229
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:02,220
shouldn't have seen it as a weakness I

230
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:04,259
did and I was super unhealthy and I

231
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,729
didn't necessarily want to reject it I

232
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:09,479
would still do what I was naturally

233
00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:11,699
going to do but I felt like I had to be

234
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:13,440
okay with like taking a hit for it

235
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:15,360
almost like socially that people look

236
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,130
down on me when really I shouldn't have

237
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,419
expected that that's just not the

238
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:20,009
reality that we should live with and

239
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:21,659
internalized course number five what are

240
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:24,720
some stereotypes you struggle with I

241
00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:28,020
would say that I struggle a lot less now

242
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,460
with stereotypes I think one thing I do

243
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,560
still kind of struggle with is like

244
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:33,300
being compared with other Asian girls

245
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,120
like I think going to a predominantly

246
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:38,419
white college it's really easy for like

247
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,010
Asian girls to be you know kind of

248
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:41,570
next to each other especially if they

249
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:43,490
have similar interests and whatnot and

250
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:45,290
just being like okay who's like the

251
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:47,180
superior asian girl or who's the

252
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:49,070
prettier asian girl and I definitely

253
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:51,010
struggle with that especially in my

254
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:53,750
sophomore year where I felt like after

255
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:55,699
rushing and enjoying a sorority like I

256
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:57,620
felt like that was you know Augmented

257
00:08:55,699 --> 00:08:58,880
just me being compared to other Asian

258
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,769
girls because there was like some sort

259
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,810
of quota that Greek houses were trying

260
00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:04,639
to fit because Greek houses can be

261
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:06,769
racist but I think I've gotten over that

262
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:09,350
a lot first after taking a gap year what

263
00:09:06,769 --> 00:09:12,170
you can hear all about my gap year vlogs

264
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:14,240
so this is really messy as you can tell

265
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:16,310
but I'm gonna blend it out with blending

266
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,079
brush and that makes everything better

267
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:19,399
but going back to the stereotype thing

268
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,959
when I was younger I definitely

269
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:23,529
struggled with being like the goody

270
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,519
two-shoes a lot and I felt really

271
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:28,550
self-conscious in like middle school

272
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,290
that like I know I was just so nerdy and

273
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:32,329
I did everything right and I felt like

274
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:33,800
it was a bad thing I felt like people

275
00:09:32,329 --> 00:09:35,779
were gonna call me out for because I was

276
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,220
Asian and instead of giving me credit

277
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:39,769
for it and being like wow that's really

278
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:42,170
impressive that you can like play piano

279
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:43,490
and you get good grades and all of that

280
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:45,050
they just be like well it's just cuz

281
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:47,149
you're Asian and I was so annoyed that I

282
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:50,089
was not getting credit for hard work

283
00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:52,310
because it was being just thrown on my

284
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:55,970
race and that actually connects to the

285
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:57,649
model minority myth that Asians are you

286
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:01,070
know somehow genetically

287
00:09:57,649 --> 00:10:03,079
good at things and it really discredits

288
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:04,850
a lot of Asians for what they've done

289
00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:07,640
and what they've contributed to society

290
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:10,040
and also is really good at causing

291
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:12,410
division between minorities when there

292
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:14,750
should not be any and it's really good

293
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:16,760
for causing division between Asians when

294
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:18,140
they feel like they don't fit into the

295
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,180
model minority myth and I feel like they

296
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:22,880
failed in some way next I'm gonna take a

297
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:25,730
little bit of peaches and cream and just

298
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,410
throw that on the center of my lids and

299
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:31,220
next to line my eyes I'm gonna use milk

300
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:33,500
makeups shadow liner in the shade BP

301
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:35,420
just a brown color question number six

302
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:38,630
is can you speak your language so for me

303
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:42,050
that would be Chinese or Cantonese and

304
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:43,880
Korean I cannot unfortunately which is

305
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:45,320
something that I'm really sad about but

306
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,580
I've been trying to learn Korean

307
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,610
last year a little bit I went on a

308
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:52,550
missions trip to Korea and I picked up

309
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:55,040
some words and I can kind of like read a

310
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:58,730
little bit in Hangul but I'm really bad

311
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:01,220
at it but my boyfriend's Korean and he

312
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:03,770
helps me out try to learn a few words

313
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:05,210
question number seven is husby engaging

314
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:07,910
American affected your relationship with

315
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:09,680
your parents and I think it definitely

316
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:11,630
affected a little more when I was

317
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,520
younger my mom wasn't a create like a

318
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,960
legit tiger mom but she was a little

319
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,790
tiger mom ish you know definitely

320
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,230
whipped us into shape but I was honestly

321
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:20,000
very thankful for it like I said I was a

322
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:22,550
goody two-shoes kid my parents are both

323
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,710
first generation and grew up in the

324
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:26,300
States and can speak perfect English and

325
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:28,040
I'm really thankful for that that we

326
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:30,070
never had communication issues but

327
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:32,690
definitely you know generational values

328
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:35,890
that they grew up with or a lot harsher

329
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:38,360
and more strict than what we see as

330
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:40,190
Americans we were just like no other

331
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,260
family or no other kids have to follow

332
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:44,150
these kinds of rules like doing the next

333
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:46,730
year's math over the summer before the

334
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:49,030
school year or just strictness and how

335
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:51,530
we had to dress and stuff like that but

336
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:53,150
at the same time I think I was really

337
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:55,610
I'm really thankful that I saw the value

338
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:58,340
and everything my parents did and wanted

339
00:11:55,610 --> 00:12:00,650
us to do and also my my family is very

340
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:03,830
strongly Christian and I think that

341
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:06,470
really helped interestingly my parents

342
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:08,990
got less strict as they became more

343
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:10,340
Christian because the stuff that they

344
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:11,660
wanted us to focus on became very

345
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:14,840
different so rather than being so

346
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:16,580
concerned about math and reading and

347
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,900
scores and stuff they're like okay we

348
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:20,180
want you to be happy we want you to grow

349
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,920
up we want you to grow up loving God and

350
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:24,350
knowing your identity and knowing that

351
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,750
you're valued so we're gonna focus on

352
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:28,310
that and that was honestly so so helpful

353
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:30,590
for my relationship with my parents and

354
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:32,180
I'm so thankful for it on the other hand

355
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:34,520
going up Asian American has definitely

356
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:36,530
made my relationship with my

357
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,480
grandparents and extended family very

358
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:40,010
interesting especially my grandparents

359
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,080
just like a lot of different values I

360
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:44,300
know there's a lot of racism also in

361
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:46,010
especially in Korean culture I know

362
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,810
that's obviously not true of all Koreans

363
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:50,960
but it's just like a thing there's a lot

364
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:52,880
of pride in like your nationality which

365
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:55,010
is awesome but also it can result in

366
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,750
like discrimination against people who

367
00:12:55,010 --> 00:13:01,090
are not Korean so I

368
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:02,800
a half chinese half Korean family that

369
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:04,960
obviously can cause some issues as you

370
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,000
can imagine my trip to Korea was

371
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,250
honestly so like super healing of that

372
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,230
and I feel like God just like did a lot

373
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,880
my heart that trip to like give me

374
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:14,130
empathy and show where their time from

375
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,570
and also show that it's like something

376
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:18,250
that like they grew up with just

377
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:19,900
historically through Wars through

378
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:22,330
whatever and it's also got a lot better

379
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:24,400
where they don't openly show as much

380
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:26,110
discrimination towards Chinese people so

381
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,000
oh that's good

382
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:29,530
course number eight is how do you feel

383
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,630
about your heritage now do you identify

384
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:33,340
with it and I would say I've definitely

385
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:36,040
throughout college high school and

386
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:38,770
college going to be a lot more vocal

387
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:41,380
about like my Asian pride I guess I've

388
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:43,140
learned a lot more about specifically

389
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:46,540
what it means to be Chinese or Korean

390
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:49,450
American through friends and through

391
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:50,410
just life education and growing up and

392
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:52,450
realizing that it's something so

393
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:54,820
valuable to hold on to I also feel like

394
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:57,850
my relationship with God has also helped

395
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:59,890
me to really just acknowledge the fact

396
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:02,530
that I was made intentionally like me

397
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:05,589
being half chinese half Korean was by

398
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:08,170
God's design and that I should look for

399
00:14:05,589 --> 00:14:10,330
the strengths and that which to me is I

400
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:13,390
have the opportunity to help represent

401
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:15,580
and help elevate people of color and

402
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:17,560
other Asian American girls help push the

403
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:20,200
Asian American representation forward

404
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:22,270
through media through education and

405
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,860
whatever and though it can definitely be

406
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:26,740
seen as like a burden I'm like you know

407
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:28,510
what like if that is what something

408
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,320
God's called me to I'm gonna take it and

409
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,910
run with it

410
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,500
sorry I totally just stop saying yes

411
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:35,470
what I'm doing but next I'm gonna

412
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:37,270
contour with my Too Faced cocoa contour

413
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:38,410
palette and Amy's last question number

414
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:40,600
nine is what is your favorite thing

415
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:43,120
about being Asian American slash your

416
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,990
heritage I would say I love that I feel

417
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,870
like I have something to bring to the

418
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:49,780
table I love that I have a family with a

419
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:52,930
history and I love the values of Asian

420
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:54,910
culture of working hard and those are

421
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:57,250
things that are kind of often lost in

422
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:59,380
Western culture I love the art and

423
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:01,720
aesthetics of Asian culture both Chinese

424
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:03,700
and Korean I love the food both Chinese

425
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:06,190
and Korean I don't know I feel like it

426
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:08,350
gives me something about myself that

427
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:10,660
provides community in a really

428
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:13,690
full way just you know uniting with

429
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:15,280
other asian-americans and also just

430
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:18,460
something to protect as I get older

431
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:20,470
since America is this amazing wonderful

432
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:22,780
melting pot of cultures but there's also

433
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:24,670
like the integrity of it that I've

434
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:26,320
started to learn the value of as we

435
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:28,570
become a culture of like you know the

436
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,100
mixing pot and whatever that it's really

437
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:32,530
important to see the distinction and

438
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:34,450
hold on to the history of what it means

439
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:36,610
to be Korean American or Chinese

440
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:38,710
American and I'm actually gonna answer

441
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:40,810
one bonus question because I get this

442
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:43,600
question a lot and that is do you feel

443
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:45,760
more Chinese or more Korean having grown

444
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,790
up as you know a mixed Chinese

445
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:51,490
korean-american as I'm putting on this

446
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:53,320
blush from was this from the faceshop

447
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:53,590
it's just a really peachy blush Dee with

448
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,420
her

449
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:58,000
peachy makeup look and I actually

450
00:15:55,420 --> 00:16:00,100
personally so I grew up in San Francisco

451
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,860
go there's a huge huge tiniest

452
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:05,320
population and so I grew up with a lot

453
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:07,720
more Chinese culture I was also largely

454
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:09,850
raised by my mom who was Chinese my dad

455
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,860
worked a lot and I sought to say that he

456
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:13,600
wasn't present in my life but like the

457
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:15,340
value systems and like the ways of

458
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,860
thinking the food that my mom prepared

459
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:18,880
was largely Chinese so I feel like I

460
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,620
grew up with a lot of Chinese influence

461
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,970
not even realizing it just cuz it was so

462
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:24,490
normal like we would go to the Chinese

463
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:26,770
grocery store and we would make wontons

464
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:29,080
together and you know stuff like that

465
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:30,580
you know we got Chinese New Year off for

466
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,590
school because it was such a big there's

467
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:35,160
such a big Chinese population also

468
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:38,680
highlighting with a face job highlighter

469
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:41,760
but as I've gone to college I've gotten

470
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,930
to get to know a lot more Koreans and

471
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,460
learn what it even means to be

472
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:47,170
korean-american I literally didn't grow

473
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:49,690
up around any Korean Americans until

474
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:51,430
college like high school there was one

475
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:53,470
of the Korean Roland and we never went

476
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:55,000
to a Korean Church what we did but I was

477
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,800
like an infant so it's been really cool

478
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,540
getting to know what it means to be

479
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,160
Korean I would say it's really hard like

480
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:02,380
I don't ever want to choose one and say

481
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,360
that like oh I feel more Korean or more

482
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:06,250
Chinese and just kind of ignore the

483
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,930
other one but I would say they came into

484
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,580
my lives at very different points in

485
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:12,520
time just because of the environment I

486
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:13,930
was in and the people I was around but I

487
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,510
would say they're both equally valuable

488
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:18,350
to me and you know my parents are both

489
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:21,500
equally valuable to me and

490
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:24,110
different influences on me personality

491
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:26,809
wise and culturally are both really

492
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:31,370
important and play I think equally heavy

493
00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:33,500
roles so I'd say I'm pretty even split

494
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:35,299
as boring of an answer as that is a

495
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:39,890
whoops I forgot my lip color oh my gosh

496
00:17:35,299 --> 00:17:41,299
okay I'm just using siren by Revlon okay

497
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:43,039
I first discovered this lipstick because

498
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:44,240
Jenin talked about it when she was like

499
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:47,570
a college student

500
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,880
