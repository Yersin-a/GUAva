done a vlog in such a long time it's

12
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:37,230
crazy how much stuff I have for my

13
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,840
luggage not a lot actually because I

14
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:43,680
don't really need that much and then I'm

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,600
probably thinking of getting a bag yes

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,250
but yes you guys may be wondering is

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,050
well you've never done a vlog in such a

18
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,480
long time what makes you want to do it

19
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,640
I just wanted to document this part

20
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,940
there's so many things that I've filmed

21
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,070
but I haven't actually edited and got

22
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:02,910
myself to edit because this semester has

23
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:05,040
been pretty crazy I love it I

24
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,540

25
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,790
for Thanksgiving break even though I

26
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,939

27
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:14,490
for the bulldozing of the next semester

28
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:17,790

29
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:21,479
