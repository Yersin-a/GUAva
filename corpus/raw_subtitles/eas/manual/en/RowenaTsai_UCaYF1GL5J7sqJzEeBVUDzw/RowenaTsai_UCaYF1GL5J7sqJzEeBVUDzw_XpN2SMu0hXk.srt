00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,170
Hey guys, welcome back

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:06,960
So I recently asked you guys on my Instagram if you had any questions for me regarding college life after college

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:14,070
Finding a job career anything that had to do with school and graduation and there's over there's a good amount of questions

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,520
I typed out a hundred questions and I try to get them down to about

5
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,320
thirty

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,189
Maybe a little more. I broke them down into five sections

7
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:24,730
the first one will be about

8
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:29,250
Context and background about my experience when I majored in what school I went to what grades I got

9
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,280
I think grades are important and then the second section will be

10
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,720
Finding your thing or like finding your purpose finding your career

11
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,660
slash calling and then we'll talk about life post-grad my current career path

12
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,440
Which is mostly YouTube and media and the last section will be about life advices in general. So

13
00:00:45,309 --> 00:00:50,339
Yeah, there's a lot of questions gonna try to get through them ASAP. And so let's get started

14
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,468
Thank you so much Skillshare for sponsoring this video

15
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:56,669
They're my favorite online learning community and you guys up and around you will know this by now

16
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:03,269
they're as always offering the first five hundred people a two month free trial against this a little bit later and

17
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,510
Let's start it

18
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:13,290
How does she know what you wanted to do I had no idea what I wanted to do graduating from college

19
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,470
I had no idea. I would be sitting here five years later

20
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:22,019
Making a video about my college experience. What was your major in college? What made you choose?

21
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,600
I majored in business and then I chose that because

22
00:01:24,729 --> 00:01:29,729
It could double in a lot of things within business because there's marketing there's finance. There's accounting

23
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:32,849
there's so many things within business out allowed for

24
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:38,369
Flexibility for me to choose and for me to figure out as I go. How to be happy when you're in a university,

25
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:42,569
which is in your dream university? you can always transfer the only colleges

26
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:50,489
That I got into after high school were state colleges in California. Saw the Cal States and UC Riverside. I

27
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:55,680
Went to UC Riverside because that was the best option and they gave me a decent amount of scholarship

28
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,819
I knew going in like this is the most important part I knew going and I was going to sir

29
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:06,659
Regardless if it was one year two year three years. I was going to transfer to either a butter. You see better you see

30
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:13,110
UCLA UC Berkeley or I was in a transferred to USC and thankfully everything worked out within one year so as with anything in life

31
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:17,490
If there's a way if there's a will if there's a will there's a way you have to peel

32
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,579
Did you work during school and if so, how did you find balance?

33
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:26,880
I worked every summer starting from my junior year of high school. It's you know year of college. I was working

34
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:31,469
While I was going to school so I stacked there's something here that wants to come out

35
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:37,499
But it's not coming out. I stuck to my classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays. So it's from like 8 a.m. To 4 p.m

36
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,910
Or 6 p.m. All day

37
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:45,089
I packed back-to-back classes so that Monday Wednesdays and Fridays I could work and I was working at a social media agency. Are grades

38
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:49,469
important? and we stress about getting good grades so much that we don't live in the moment

39
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,380
This is tricky. I want to say no

40
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:58,350
But it's also a yes because it really depends on what you want to do after you graduate the internships that I have one was

41
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:04,499
out of granola bar company called this bar same size for every bar that you I they will give a

42
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:10,919
Life-saving bar to a kid in need. It's kind of like palm a for-profit before good one for one model

43
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,310
So I worked out companies like that

44
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:15,720
Most of my other friends are going to consulting and us my making

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,279
Because those are like the legit jobs and when you were in a hyper-competitive environment

46
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:23,550
Where everyone's studying business and I was in a business fraternity

47
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:29,369
you kind of get tunnel vision and you just want to be the best and that's kind of what the best things were but I

48
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:34,050
Was like I'm just gonna do me even if people think I'm not as legit, which they did

49
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:37,709
They thought I was in legit because I didn't have a fancy job

50
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:43,109
But I was like I just gonna do me someone I wanna be happy grand scheme of things

51
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:49,649
I don't think grades matter at all because the fact that we're alive and that we're breathing and that we were born

52
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:54,989
It's like a one thing a billionth chance. So why limit ourselves and wide to find ourselves by grades?

53
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,820
but then again

54
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,829
If you know a career want and grades are important then increase are important

55
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:08,490
Do you have good grades in university? I graduated with barely a 3.0. I think I had a 3.0 one or three

56
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:14,269
So no, but I'm proud of myself for graduating with a third point above a 3.0 GPA

57
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:19,099
How do you stay happy in college through all of this stress? so I say happy through

58
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:25,040
Drinking and partying and going to raves and having fun with my friends and I put more emphasis on that

59
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:26,910
Than I did on my studies

60
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:32,600
but the thing is I kind of shot myself in the foot because I wasn't even happy when I was doing that I was

61
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:39,199
Doing that because I was avoiding reality. I was avoiding my responsibility some of the thoughts in my head and I was avoiding myself

62
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,539
I was avoid facing myself. So what I

63
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,030
Wish this upon anyone else

64
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:44,810
I don't think so

65
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:50,419
But I would say that I think it's so important to enjoy our youths. I don't regret anything I did because now

66
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,680
That I'm here

67
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,109
I'm like, okay been there done that never want to be there again

68
00:04:54,110 --> 00:05:00,440
But I know what it's like so I think it's important that omits airing yourself in books and studying

69
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,630
To your head out every once in a while. Oh, wow. Have fun with your friends go

70
00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:12,739
Enjoy being a teen or like a 20-something year old because we're never gonna get that back the older you get the more

71
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:16,699
Responsibilities you have and I guess on that note if I could do it all over again

72
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,399
I would spend more time getting to know myself for sure

73
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:26,570
I didn't know how to do it back then looking inward reflecting asking myself the hard questions so that I'm not just like

74
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,359
Avoiding and running away all the time and also to not take office hours professors

75
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:40,729
School like offerings like our school or universities. There's so many resources that I just completely like I didn't care most important thing

76
00:05:40,729 --> 00:05:44,959
I took for granted was the proximity and which I lived with my friends now. I'm in New York

77
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,079
most of my friends are in San Francisco or LA so it's like

78
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,900
You can't really you know

79
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:58,489
I suck at keeping in touch the phones and messages like I'm really good with people when I'm like face-to-face, but I'm terrible with

80
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,880
Keeping up with people. They're texting

81
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,160
so that's something I'm working on but

82
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,680
That's that. How to be mindful over your future rather than let fear of it stress you out?

83
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,950
So I'm reading this really great book called 10% happier, and I'm gonna quote "starving is fine

84
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,610
as long as is tempered by the

85
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:23,860
Realization that in entropic universe the final outcome is out of your control if you don't waste your energy on variables you cannot influence

86
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:30,700
You can focus much more effectively on those you can when you're wisely ambitious you do everything you can to succeed

87
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:33,009
But you're not attached to the outcome either

88
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:37,510
this is the most important you're not attached to the outcome so that if you fail you will be

89
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:42,159
Maximally resilient able to get up dust yourself off and get back in the fray"

90
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,910
Do you believe in 5-year plans or do you think you should take life as a hits yet?

91
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:53,500
So I was firm believer in the five-year plan in the one three five and ten-year plan. That was

92
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:59,590
Textbook Rowena, but over the years, especially when I started YouTube. I just realized that

93
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:07,359
Life is constantly changing cuz you want to control it. You can so I've learned to accept and embrace uncertainty as

94
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:14,799
My reality instead of trying to line everything down to the T because no matter how much you plan

95
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:16,820
Things are gonna happen

96
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,820
Things aren't gonna go according to plan

97
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:24,999
Historically. I've been a very J like a hardcore J from the myers-briggs like judgment

98
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:26,960
document pull

99
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:34,419
Something with the J. I've learned to become more perceiving. I've learned to become more go with the flow take life as it comes

100
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,560
Like enjoy the breeze and not to be so, you know with planning

101
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,739
So yeah, I think I'm more of the latter now take life as it hits. Yeah

102
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:48,849
That made me giggle. Okay. What can I do to support my bestie who is in college and horribly burnt out

103
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:49,820
No

104
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:53,769
I'd say kidnap your bestie to go on a BFF date and

105
00:07:54,050 --> 00:08:00,130
If she's like I cannot leave my studies for more than X amount of time then just take her to grab food

106
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,969
Get her mind off of her studies when you're so in something

107
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:07,479
You need to be peeled out and peeled off and I think in retrospect

108
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:13,269
Me and all my friends as much as we might have not like do the moment

109
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:17,289
You're like ripping us away from our studies in the long run

110
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:22,119
It was like thank you think now looking back instead of like thank you for looking out for me

111
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:32,559
What do I do if I can't find a purpose right after school? I'm scared of becoming stagnant. The thing with finding your purpose

112
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:38,319
I was a solution when I thought that after I found my purpose my life would just be smooth sailing

113
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:45,250
Now you will find your purpose and then you'll be tested again and you'll kind of forget and you'll find it again and they'll kind

114
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,190
Of lose it again and they kind of find it again. I mean that's just life

115
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:51,190
We as humans are constantly changing and growing so our North Star

116
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:58,179
May be implanted in the sky for the foreseeable future, but the closer you get to it

117
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,180
You might be able to see it from a different perspective

118
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:01,190
so

119
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:07,599
Although your North Star doesn't change you're constantly changing and the way in which you get to that North Star or let fall of that

120
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:14,589
North Star may also change this wall. So I think what's most important is to never stop learning always stay curious with a growth mindset

121
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,630
you can't go wrong and you won't be stagnant because if you're always

122
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:24,550
Willing to learn if you're always questioning if you're always curious about the world around you

123
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:31,120
That's the recipe for not staying stagnant a few ways that I've continued to learn after I graduated

124
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:38,260
One is through reading. I love business and self-help books and I just recently got into more like fiction books

125
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,299
I think sometimes are too wild and crazy' for me

126
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:45,190
But it is great to let your mind explore and implant your brain into different

127
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:49,239
Universes every once in a while. And another way is through online courses like Skillshare

128
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:54,609
So Skillshare is an online learning community with over 25,000 classes and design business

129
00:09:55,670 --> 00:10:00,159
Creativity anything arts you can think of how to edit videos how to paint

130
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,680
There's actually a course on there that I want to share with you guys

131
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:07,959
It's called Discovering success 7 exercises to uncover your purpose passion and hat

132
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:11,889
I think this is great for anyone who is kind of like what do I do?

133
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:16,390
I kind of have this creative thing that I want to do, but there's also this like more stable

134
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:20,440
Financially sound path that I want to walk like which path do I take?

135
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:25,329
She does a really good job of breaking everything down and I talked about these things in my older videos

136
00:10:25,329 --> 00:10:30,879
but never end up like this, so it's like redefining what success means to you breaking free of

137
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,460
Going back to the beginning

138
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:38,009
Listening to what you love choosing a direction managing your time money strategies

139
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,790
so I think all of these are really

140
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:45,029
Important things and topics there's not as many crash courses on this like you don't learn about these things in school

141
00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:49,709
This is something you're interested in the first 500 people will get a two-month premium

142
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:54,599
Membership trouble which will give you access to all of the courses on Skillshare. So

143
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,480
there's that

144
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:03,120
Moving on I got rejected from nursing school three times that I don't know what to do from here. Do I change paths? I

145
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,229
Think this comes down to how badly do you want to be a nurse?

146
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:10,020
If you know it is your life's calling if you know

147
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:16,139
I must be a nurse because you love helping people and you want to help save lives then

148
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,679
Keep applying and don't take no for an answer

149
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:25,650
And I think this is with anything in life any job that you're thinking of if you want something badly enough. You're gonna keep

150
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,599
Trying until you get it. Yes, but if you ask yourself and you're like

151
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,730
I think I want to be a nurse because

152
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:39,060
It's what is expected of me or it's what I thought I should do because of something other than what you wanted to do for

153
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,050
Yourself then maybe

154
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:47,550
Maybe it's a sign from the universe that you should pivot but these answers only we will know when we spend the quiet hours

155
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,510
with our own thoughts

156
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:53,280
Late at night or early in the mornings when you're just questioning everything

157
00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:00,330
Okay. Advice on choosing the career you want versus the career that pays better? it's tough

158
00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:05,009
So there's two things. The first thing I would say is the career that pays well is like a steady

159
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,909
Pay right and the baby by the time you're 60

160
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:16,380
You're like here the career that you want may not pay well in the beginning. There's three years five years. You might be making nothing

161
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,890
But the potential of it growing

162
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,580
Exponentially is a lot more than that like stable career path

163
00:12:25,209 --> 00:12:28,709
Or there's a lot more potential and possibility for it to grow

164
00:12:28,709 --> 00:12:33,359
So that's the first thing question that I ask myself is long-term fulfillment versus short-term satisfaction

165
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:40,979
I think a stable career path definitely falls into short-term satisfaction because you don't really have to think about most things and you

166
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:44,900
Have your life planned out for you long-term for fulfillment?

167
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:51,290
If you're gonna eventually do what you want to do, which is what I think most rational humans go through

168
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:53,070
That's why we have midlife crises

169
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:57,860
Where we doubt everything and we question everything and we look back and like why did I live my life for the past?

170
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:04,040
Five decades like this when it's not what I wanted to do or it's not who I am what really helped me

171
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:10,879
Stay true to my path and to not waver when I wave I wavered a lot actually

172
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,590
But what helped me stay grounded was that if you're going to go down this path eventually

173
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:20,360
Might as well go down went now how to stay positive when others are doubting my next steps?

174
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,249
I really think it's self-awareness. If you know yourself well enough, you know what you're doing if you know why you're doing what you're doing

175
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,380
Which can change?

176
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,060
and which can be

177
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:35,600
Cloudy at times, but if you have a decent enough understanding, it'll allow you to

178
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,310
Not care as much about what others say or tell you

179
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,849
But that being said it's good to it's good to listen

180
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:50,239
To what other people are saying and it's good to listen to their advices whether you take it or not. It's fully up to yourself

181
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:57,889
Okay. Advice for graduates who've decided to take creative and unconventional paths?

182
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:00,499
I don't know why that was so choppy and what I was just reading it

183
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:04,309
I think the hardest part is over taking that leap of faith leaving in yourself and

184
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:10,759
Working through all the knots and a mess in your head to be like, I'm gonna do this. So keep doing it

185
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:17,600
But also remember if you have to pivot and change your course and change your path as you walk this path

186
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,329
It's not failure, right? You're not failing

187
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:25,249
if you didn't do the thing you set out to do I think life is a continual process of

188
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,160
iterations and pivoting and

189
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:33,709
changing and I've always thought a path is like this but I think life is actually more like this and sometimes like

190
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,060
You know

191
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:41,750
Okay, what helped you find your purpose and how did you know that you found it? This question is gonna take way too long

192
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,400
I'll link to videos down below

193
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,189
I mean I hate when people do this because like just told me no

194
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:53,120
But seriously I have other videos one is about I created my dream job and the second is how I found my life purpose

195
00:14:53,160 --> 00:15:00,110
So those two will be linked down below below how many years passed after graduation when you were content with your place and life

196
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:05,119
so I was content the day I graduated I was so happy the day I graduated I was like

197
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:11,479
Yes, I don't know school wasn't really for me. I don't really learn in that like school environment

198
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,250
I wasn't good at taking tests

199
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:19,339
I didn't let that define me too much because I knew I had strengths outside of taking tests

200
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,430
but when I

201
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:25,969
Finally felt like I could breathe and that I could look at myself in the mirror and tell myself you did

202
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,970
Well, Romina child, you did well

203
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,320
It was actually earlier this year

204
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:38,060
Most difficult adjustment you had to make going into life post graduation. I think the most

205
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:45,290
Difficult thing I think it's not comparing myself to those around me because the path that I chose for myself was very different

206
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,700
It wasn't what other people were doing

207
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:51,800
And it's so easy to look around me and to be like all of my friends already started working all my friends

208
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,420
Are you started making money all my friends?

209
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:57,860
They're doing the things already and it just felt like I was gonna fall behind

210
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:04,220
I already fell behind because I didn't go down that path but then I just kept reminding myself the whole

211
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:10,100
short-term satisfaction versus long-term game short-term satisfaction would have been to that my ego and to

212
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:15,410
Do what? I thought I should do a I knew long-term

213
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:22,009
That was gonna make me happy. What do you wish you had done in your final year to prepare you for life after graduation?

214
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:27,530
I think going back to what I said earlier. I wish I spent more time in here like trying to work out

215
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:33,949
this and like this and being a better friend to myself and trying to get to know myself better because

216
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,730
I did a lot of that after graduating, but if I started doing that in college

217
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:43,730
I think that would have helped a lot a lot has graduation helped define you as a person and what success means to you?

218
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:46,970
has graduation helped define you as a person, uh

219
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,269
Not really. I feel like I don't really talk about

220
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:52,800
USC

221
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,540
at all after

222
00:16:54,540 --> 00:17:00,209
Graduating I realized I like found my definition of success and it definitely wasn't my grades

223
00:17:00,209 --> 00:17:02,170
It wasn't the fact that I graduated

224
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:09,059
It wasn't the job that I would get nothing success to me at that time was just being able to find

225
00:17:09,549 --> 00:17:14,369
The answer to what it means to live a meaningful and fulfilling life

226
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:18,719
I think that was what my definition was of success at that time

227
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,669
And it's constantly changing

228
00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:25,349
I think now for me talks about this in my podcast with Eileen from lab and dare

229
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:31,169
I think success to me now me it just means like being able to go to sleep at night content with

230
00:17:31,659 --> 00:17:36,899
how the day went I mean it's very like there's a lot of layers to that and

231
00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:44,189
Me being able to go to sick content is that I did my best and everything that I could during the day for work

232
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:49,829
by helping people because my work is trying to help people in many different ways either through

233
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,049
Beauty within, or through my own personal channel

234
00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:57,418
so there's a lot of layers to that by think at the end of the day like the our definition of success should

235
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:01,319
Be defined by ourselves, and it's normal if it changes over time

236
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,260
Because we're constantly changing as people

237
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,350
ever felt lost

238
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:11,760
Professionally post-college. If so, how did you deal slash break out of it? Yeah, dude

239
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:17,760
I felt professionally lost up until I'd say last year. So I graduated 2014

240
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:22,319
2014 to 15 16 17 18. Four years

241
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:29,339
Four years, I was like, what am I doing with my life? Did I make the right decisions? Why am I here?

242
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:33,600
What is the right path is there even a right path? And the answer I talked about in last week's video

243
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,130
I don't really think there is a right path. I think our path is a culmination of the decisions

244
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,789
We've made in our lives and eventually

245
00:18:39,789 --> 00:18:41,250
It like it's there already

246
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:46,649
if you believe in fate if you believe in destiny like our path is there we just need to walk it and if so,

247
00:18:46,649 --> 00:18:48,649
How did you deal?

248
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:52,500
Break out of it. Just have to keep walking. Even if it's blind faith

249
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,340
Even if it's with mustering

250
00:18:54,340 --> 00:19:01,199
every ounce of courage you have in the depths of your soul - just like trust yourself and trust the universe to move forward and

251
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,380
It goes back to learning

252
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,669
staying curious

253
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:09,749
Trying your best and not being attached to the end results how difficult was it to move to New York City. Did you do it alone?

254
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,199
It wasn't difficult at all. And yes, I did it alone

255
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:18,569
How long did it take to fully transition from moving across the country to New York? I did

256
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:25,979
because I moved around so often when I was young it just like it wasn't a thing

257
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:30,150
I just knew I needed I want it to be in New York. And so I just went and I just

258
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,699
Lived and I it just kind of happened

259
00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:36,239
Did you want to continue studying to avoid working?

260
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,149
Absolutely not. I hated studying. I couldn't wait to graduate from high school college

261
00:19:42,149 --> 00:19:47,669
I think I had more fun. But I also know that I don't like studying at all

262
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,759
All right. Now we're gonna move to career /youtube.

263
00:19:53,799 --> 00:20:00,778
I Think I'll do a separate video answering your guys's questions about YouTube starting YouTube wanting to start YouTube advice for starting YouTube

264
00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:03,809
But this one is a little it's a little more broad

265
00:20:03,809 --> 00:20:07,859
How do you decide what to do in life as a career when you're not sure. What do you enjoy?

266
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:13,949
I think just constant forward movement or just constant movement. It could be lateral. It could be vertical

267
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:18,750
it could be any type of movement but as long as you're trying as long as you're actively

268
00:20:19,149 --> 00:20:23,489
Engaging yourself and everything in you to try new things

269
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:29,970
You will find your thing eventually when I graduated. I thought I was gonna start my own business that didn't happen

270
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:34,409
We can just say it failed. I thought I was gonna code cuz I love text startup

271
00:20:34,409 --> 00:20:39,778
So I was like I could do that UX UI that seems really cool. But like that also didn't really go anywhere because I couldn't

272
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,510
Like I just I can

273
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,909
like the coding language just

274
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:53,429
Symbols and numbers just they didn't work with me and my neighbor's dog is just right outside. So if I hear the dog barking

275
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:59,850
went into media work never in a million years what I thought I would work in journalism or at a media company because

276
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:05,639
My focus was very a tech and business and then started my youtube channel and start helping on beauty within

277
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,569
It just kind of all came together as I like progressed in life

278
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,490
and there are this whole journey

279
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:13,299
it was a lot of a

280
00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:17,339
Lot of wavering a lot of back-and-forth a lot of doubting a lot of questioning of what it's the right path

281
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:22,150
What is the right thing to do? That's why I said it or a little that there really is no right path

282
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:28,570
Just keep walking and keep believing in yourself. Keep questioning yourself, like healthily questioning yourself

283
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:32,439
I'm reminding yourself of who you are and what you're doing. Why are you doing what you're doing?

284
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:36,849
And then eventually the path will reveal itself as it did with me

285
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,920
Yeah, when should I really start applying for jobs?

286
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:44,950
This is really up to you

287
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:50,290
if you want advice as a Marshall School graduate

288
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,339
You would start your sophomore year of

289
00:21:55,490 --> 00:22:03,280
college applying for internships because that's how competitive people are nowadays you get an internship sophomore junior year at a

290
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:08,320
Big firm, they will most likely give you an offer when you graduate your senior year

291
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:13,510
But if you ask Rowena Rowena, when's the best time to apply for college?

292
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:18,940
It's up to you. Maybe you don't want to apply to jobs. Maybe you do want to apply to jobs

293
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:22,629
What jobs do you want to apply for? I think those are questions that only we'll be able to answer for yourself

294
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:28,329
Do companies actually prefer someone with a college degree for a job in your industry

295
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:32,590
So I think it depends if you want to work on like the agency side

296
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,590
I think it helps to have a degree

297
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:38,379
To ten extent most corporations do look at your as a man

298
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:42,880
They kind of do care what that like you went to college at least

299
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,490
But what I am doing right now

300
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:52,030
Like as a creator you can have zero degree and you can create content anyone can create content

301
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:56,799
How to find work in the media industry when it's so competitive

302
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,220
So I think with this it's it doesn't matter if it's media

303
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,120
It doesn't matter what industry that you're going for

304
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,829
I think going back to the whole Dyson analogy of if you want something badly enough

305
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:08,140
You won't stop until you get a yes

306
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:12,609
and one thing that I was actually pretty surprised to find was that you can

307
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:18,010
Use your student card so hard so reach out to ten people on LinkedIn

308
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:23,560
who has a job that you might be interested in and ask for an informational interview and

309
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:27,250
What this means is that you can just ask them about their career ask them about

310
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:33,739
Their life their path how they got there and you'd be surprised at least two out of ten. People will say yes to you

311
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:39,589
It's a natural human instinct to want to help other people if you reach out as a student and you say like hey

312
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,590
I'm not really sure what I want to do with my life

313
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,640
Maybe you don't say that'd be a little more professional

314
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:48,949
but if you allude to that then the person reading it like a professional reading that would be like, oh

315
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:53,180
I remember what it was like when I graduated so like yes, yes. Yes

316
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:59,030
I will help you asking people who already there for their thoughts and their advice

317
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,689
that's really probably like the best way to go and

318
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:10,040
Also send your resume to as many people as you can don't be afraid of being annoying message recruiters

319
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:12,059
Keep in touch with recruiters

320
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:18,739
There's a lot that you can do go to career fairs get to know the recruiters from different companies that you want to work at

321
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:24,949
There's a lot yeah not being afraid of getting no and also not being afraid of being

322
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:30,469
mildly moderately annoying persistence for the most part will always work in your favor and

323
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:34,640
moving on to the last section of life advice

324
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:41,510
What are lessons you've learned in college that you still value today?

325
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,590
What did I learn in college ?

326
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:52,159
I Think I learned a lot about what I don't want to do and how I don't want to feel yeah

327
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:56,389
I think that's probably the biggest takeaway how lost and how

328
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:04,699
Alone and how down I felt it's really good gauge for me to never return to that

329
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,570
lifestyle and that

330
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:13,730
Stage of my life the partying the drinking the avoiding the running away the not facing myself not facing my reality

331
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:20,990
yeah, I think that's probably the biggest takeaway one piece of advice you give yourself if you went back in time to

332
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:23,690
2014

333
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:30,559
Everything that I say will probably be very cliche, but I think the most important thing would be

334
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,880
You're not alone

335
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,710
Everything will work out

336
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:36,710
don't stop dreaming and

337
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:42,020
Keep fighting for what you believe in. Yeah, I think those are like the four most important things

338
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,880
Yeah

339
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,599
This is why my channel do this if I can help

340
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:49,750
Even one you guys for less alone and less crazy

341
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:54,460
for dreaming the way you dream and for wanting to do the things that want to do then I've

342
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,680
succeeded

343
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,030
Navigating life is never easy

344
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:05,619
finding your purpose is never easy finding your I is never easy and it's it's the most difficult because it's something that we have to

345
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,370
Do and we can only do?

346
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:14,800
On our own but we don't have to as in like the answers you will find yourself and it's like it's very personal

347
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:21,280
But the journey you don't have to go through that alone. And I think that's what I learned few years after I graduated so

348
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,720
with all of that

349
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,740
