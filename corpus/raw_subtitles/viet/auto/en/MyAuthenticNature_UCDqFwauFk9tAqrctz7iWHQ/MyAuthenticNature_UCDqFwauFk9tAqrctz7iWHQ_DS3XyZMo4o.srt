00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:22,619
channel it has been a long long time and

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,970
I apologize as always but of course

8
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:26,460
school comes first

00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:29,490
it is finally summer I'm out of school

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:34,469
and I just came back home from Missouri

11
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:39,770
so it is all about getting back on track

12
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:43,920
so by senior year I can continue on um

13
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:46,140
really quick update this summer I will

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,149
be taking a lot of summer classes as

15
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,550
well as working at the same time so of

16
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:53,100
course everything is still on a Tuesday

17
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:56,190
Saturday schedule in terms of my blog

18
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,770
but everything else in between it just

19
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:01,739
kind of is on my own time so there may

20
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:04,439
be some weeks or some days where I don't

21
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:07,700
upload on time but please do bear with

22
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:11,820
me because I do have school and

23
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:15,030
applications open up in July for my PT

24
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,990
schools so I really have to focus on

25
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,630
that as well

26
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:23,240
and most importantly my goal for this

27
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:25,950
year is to get into therapy school so

28
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,530
once the application is opened up in

29
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:31,040
July I will be busy trying to finish my

30
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:34,290
applications getting everything together

31
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,780
and then of course if I make through

32
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,970
round one then I go through interviews

33
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,509
and go visit the schools and everything

34
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,530
like that

35
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:46,710
so yeah it's gonna be really exciting

36
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:48,420
really busy really stressful so I'm

37
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,659
really hoping this summer I will

38
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,340
actually fulfill my promise of wanting

39
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:55,500
to be back where I was when I was a

40
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,649
freshman in today's video I will be

41
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:02,009
doing the Asian American tag as I saw

42
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:03,290
from Jen M I really really look up to

43
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:07,340
her and

44
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:09,530
she is absolutely like perfection in my

45
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:11,420
eyes on all honesty I really look up to

46
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:15,890
her and I watched a lot of her videos

47
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:20,840
and when I saw this tag it like it's

48
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:24,020
struck like a heart string like it made

49
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,110
my heart throb and to hear her story of

50
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:29,510
how she grew up as an Asian American

51
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:32,990
made me want to do this tag as well

52
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:35,959

53
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:40,550

57
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:54,410
American a lot of people kind of get my

58
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:59,900
ethnicity mixed up with other Asian

59
00:02:54,410 --> 00:03:02,570
ethnicities but yeah I don't know why

60
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:04,910
both my parents look very venom ease in

61
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:07,700
my eye and when you look at me I get I

62
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:10,340
get I look like I'm Filipino or I look

00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:14,060
Chinese or lately people have been

64
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:17,450
asking if I'm Korea and it's just a

65
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:19,489
weird thing to see because my family

66
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,410
looks very bitter means in my eyes and I

67
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:25,160
and I thought I look doing two Me's but

68
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:28,040

00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,989
two which generation are you I am

70
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,910
technically first-generation American

71
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:33,799
Ford but both of my parents did

72
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:36,170
immigrate here after the war when they

73
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:38,000
were very young they were about seven or

74
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:41,510
eight years old when they first came to

75
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,610
America and yeah they grew up in the

76
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:46,130
American school system they both speak

77
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:49,790
fluent English and they are also flew in

78
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:52,310
Vietnamese most of my friends are like

79
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:54,260
they're like taken aback when they first

80
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:59,080
meet my parents because they don't have

81
00:03:54,260 --> 00:04:02,150
a Fabi accident they have a normal

82
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:05,780
American accent somewhat southern

83
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:07,800
because we're from Texas and they grew

84
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:11,690
up in Louisiana and

85
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:16,950
so we say y'all they sometimes say ax

86
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:21,090
instead of ask I kind of tether in

87
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:23,010
between there but yeah number three what

88
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:25,890
was the first experience where you felt

89
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:30,600
that Democrat of being a minority or

90
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:34,950
different um my first experience would

91
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:37,320
have to be middle school long story

92
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:38,880
short I went to private school from

93
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:43,140
kindergarten through second grade and

94
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,820
then I went to public school from third

95
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:47,090
grade through fifth grade and then I

96
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:49,080
went back to the same private school

97
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:53,490
throughout the rest of my middle school

98
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:56,220
life um growing up I didn't really have

99
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:58,530
a big problem with my ethnicity I didn't

100
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:02,520
question anything I didn't feel out of

101
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:04,890
place because I went to school in Plano

102
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:08,220
and Plano they have a lot of different

103
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:11,070
ethnicities and a lot of variation for

104
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:13,950
my regulation I don't remember a lot of

105
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:16,800
teasing of my ethnicity in my public

106
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:20,390
school system but once I went back to my

107
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:23,840
private school that's where things

108
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:27,380
changed and I didn't understand why

109
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,580
there were a lot of other

110
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:31,350
asian-americans in that school system a

111
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:34,970
lot of Vietnamese Americans in that

112
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:39,480
system or not system in that school and

113
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:44,669
so for me to be singled out most of the

114
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:48,660
time and teased was so bizarre to me I

115
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:52,380
felt very out casted in middle school I

116
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:57,060
felt that I had to change myself or act

117
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:59,040
in a certain way or change the way I or

118
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:03,840
change my personality based on who I was

119
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:06,570
talking to just so they wouldn't tease

120
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,080
me I really wanted to fit in with those

121
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:13,530
kids

122
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:17,610
I remember going into the school and I

123
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:22,560
just remember being teased a lot and

124
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:25,860
great when we when I first rejoined this

125
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:30,270
private school it was very hard

126
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:33,330
transition for me I was the nerdy kid I

127
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:36,930
was the one with the transition glasses

128
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:40,560
when everyone had contacts already I was

129
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:42,960
the kid that more like a headband and

130
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,180
had I didn't have layers my hair was too

131
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:49,560
here and look like Dora my hair was

132
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:52,050
thick and I didn't wear clear mascara or

133
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,430
like clear eyebrow gel we weren't

134
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,759
allowed to wear makeup or any nail

135
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:58,889
polish other than clear so but I never

136
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:01,710
wore any of that I didn't get my

137
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:05,779
eyebrows waxed I didn't shave yet I was

138
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:09,529
it was a very awkward time for me but

139
00:07:05,779 --> 00:07:13,020
this was the time where the bullying

140
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:16,770
really affected me and my personality it

141
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:20,610
really bothered me I felt like I was the

142
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:25,529
only one being bullied because no one

143
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:27,930
else was being teased for being Asian I

144
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:30,060
had a lot of people and a lot of people

145
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:32,940
but I had some people come up to me and

146
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:34,469
like they would do this when I'm talking

147
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:36,330
or they would tease me and I would just

148
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:39,210
say something normal or what I thought

149
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:42,539
was normal and they would they would

150
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:44,759
mock me and do this and like pull their

151
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:46,830
eyes back and it used to make me feel so

152
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:49,770
frustrated because I wasn't the only

153
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:52,050
Asian there but they didn't tease them

154
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:54,000
as much as me they always teased me and

155
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:57,569
I think it was because I was also the

156
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,400
new girl or the new girl number four

157
00:07:57,569 --> 00:08:02,580
were you always proud of your heritage

158
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:08,669
or was there a time where you rejected

159
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:13,409
it um I was never ashamed of being Asian

160
00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:18,120
I was more embarrassed of my facial

161
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:20,610
features and more embarrassed of like my

162
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:23,879
physical attributes not necessarily my

163
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:26,819
culture I was just more embarrassed

164
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:28,100
about what I looked like in middle

165
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:30,800
school than any

166
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:32,479
than anything else number five what are

167
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:37,460
some stereotypes that you struggle with

168
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:39,910
um I don't really struggle with a ton of

169
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:43,010
stereotypes I did when I was younger but

170
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:46,190
the one stereotype that I struggle with

171
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:48,740
to this day even is the stereotype that

172
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:51,650
Asians are smart because they're agents

173
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:53,510
or you're smart because you're Asian

174
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:58,850
or you got your good grade because

175
00:08:53,510 --> 00:09:02,450
you're Asian that stereotype bothers the

176
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:06,020
crap out of me um it was introduced to

177
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:08,570
me when I was in I think it was

178
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:10,970
introduced to me in elementary school

179
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:14,360
but I didn't really think much of it at

180
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:17,630
that time but it really did bother me in

181
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,820
middle school because it was constantly

182
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:23,000
thrown at me I think it really bothered

183
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:26,030
me because we were in private school we

184
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,090
were expected to be the best that we

185
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:32,030
could be we were given the privilege to

186
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:34,250
attend a private school where our

187
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:37,400
academia is supposed to be higher than

188
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:40,250
that of normal education and we were

189
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:43,940
aware of that Hill but if I was just

190
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:45,830
five points higher than this one kid or

191
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,270
another kid they were like oh well you

192
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:49,610
got five points higher because you're

193
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:51,560
Asian you're supposed you're smart

194
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:53,450
because you're Asian we all have to work

195
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:56,810
really hard but you don't have to work

196
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:59,540
hard because you're Asian it really made

197
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:03,740
me frustrated because it disregarded all

198
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:06,200
of the effort that I put into school and

199
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:09,260
all the effort I put into studying and

200
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:11,840
doing the best that I could do but it

201
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:14,960
still it bothered me but I didn't

202
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:16,970
retaliate I didn't say anything I just

203
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:20,570
said oh well you got a really good grade

204
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:22,190
too or you know like oh well she got a

205
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:25,040
better grade than me and she's not Asian

206
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:30,410
like I would say things like that to try

207
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:34,400
and be polite to not you know feed into

208
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:37,130
that stereotype and I never bragged

209
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,760
about my grades I would tell them if

210
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:40,220
they asked me

211
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:45,710
because I was honest the time when it

212
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:48,950
really bothered me was when they or was

213
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:51,880
one the kid or the group of people would

214
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:55,190
come after like my family from it I

215
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:58,100
remember this one instance and like

216
00:10:55,190 --> 00:11:01,100
after-school program I don't know how

217
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:06,350
this conversation came up but it like

218
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:09,500
really made me ain't this one kid and he

219
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:11,630
probably I think he was like one of the

220
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:14,860
couple of kids that like relentlessly

221
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:17,480
kind of went after me for being Asian I

222
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:21,200
remember we were talking about stuff and

223
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:24,110
all of a sudden there was like he had

224
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,210
like an outburst he like got in my face

225
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:29,780
and he pointed his finger at me and he

226
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:36,410
was saying stuff like oh you don't

227
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:38,600
understand what it takes to be like to

228
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:40,250
be able to go to school or whatever to

229
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:45,080
afford things I think it was like that

230
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:48,470
he basically accused me of not knowing

231
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:53,200
or not understanding what it's like to

232
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:55,850
work hard and he told me he was like

233
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,880
your parents are doctors even though

234
00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:01,010
they're not but your whole family is are

235
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,710
doctors because you're Asian things are

236
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:05,810
easy for you because you're Asian at

237
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:08,950
this point in my life I had heard

238
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:13,490
stories about my parents immigration and

239
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:15,980
it really broke my heart like to hear

240
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:18,140
all of their struggles to come to

241
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:22,430
America after the war and basically

242
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:24,740
escaping from the war it really it just

243
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:27,740
really bothered me that that he would

244
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:31,340
say all those things not realizing all

245
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:34,670
the sacrifices my family has made in

246
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:38,060
order for an order for us to have a

247
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:41,120
better life I'm getting like emotional

248
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:43,850
just talking about it I think it made me

249
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,850
more angry that he had said those things

250
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:47,660
because we were on the same standard we

251
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:50,350
went to the same

252
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:53,090
private school he was in private school

253
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:57,080
from kindergarten all the way up until

254
00:12:53,090 --> 00:13:00,050
that point and I wasn't in private

255
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:02,300
school for like three years kept telling

256
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:04,630
me that his parent with multiple jobs in

257
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:06,890
order for him to be at the school and

258
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:11,840
even though my parents didn't have

259
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:14,780
multiple jobs it's still hard work and

260
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:18,980
hard money that went into our education

261
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:22,340
cuz he didn't understand that for them

262
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:25,550
to had the jobs that they have now or

263
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:30,970
for them to be where they are now was

264
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:34,430
through a lot of hard work and it just

265
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:38,060
it just didn't make any sense to me that

266
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:41,200
he would be like so angry at me for

267
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:44,540
being Asian and for having my parents he

268
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:49,640
didn't know or he didn't realize that my

269
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:53,290
parents were refugees or were you know

270
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:57,110
immigrants from a terrible war and

271
00:13:53,290 --> 00:14:01,520
communism and a poor country number six

272
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:04,940
can you speak your language and yes I

273
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:09,050
can speak good amines but I understand

274
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:11,600
more than what I can speak if that makes

275
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:15,920
any sense I can read it phonetically but

276
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,540
I just don't know what I'm reading I've

277
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,670
been told when I was little I was like

278
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:22,730
super fluent and had a really hardcore

279
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:26,410
accent um like a hardcore northern

280
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:29,540
accent because my babysitter was from

281
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:31,570
the northern region of Vietnam and my

282
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:36,020
parents are from the southern region and

283
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:39,050
so now my Vietnamese is like a mix of

284
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:42,890
both dialects but yes I can speak it on

285
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:45,170
like a child's level but I'm very proud

286
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:48,260
that I can speak it there is a time in

287
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:49,820
Mosul another instance where me and

288
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:51,530
another vid amis friend of mine or a

289
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:54,230
couple of us we were speaking in

290
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:55,850
Vietnamese and I remember this one girl

291
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:58,399
I think she was the one we were talking

292
00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:01,009
I don't remember but she turned around

293
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:05,509
and she was like really angry she was

294
00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:07,910
like speak English you're in America so

295
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:12,009
he needed to speak American or speak

296
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:14,630
English but yes I can't speak Vietnamese

297
00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:16,220
now my brothers on another hand they

298
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:18,230
don't speak a lick of it they don't even

299
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:20,810
understand it I have to like translate

300
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:24,139
every time we go someone number seven

301
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:26,480
how has being asian-american affected

302
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:28,370
relationship with your parents it it

303
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,230
really it didn't really affect my

304
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:33,759
relationship with my parents a lot just

305
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:38,930
because my parents were Americanized but

306
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:40,759
it did bother me growing up how strict

307
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:43,100
they were but I don't know if that like

308
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:43,370
pertains to our culture or anything like

309
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:47,870
that

310
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:50,480
other than that no not really

311
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:55,209
number eight how do you feel about your

312
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,209
heritage now do you identify with it I

313
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:05,269
absolutely love my heritage I don't

314
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:07,100
really like super like embrace it and

315
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:13,339
like I'm not like super passionate about

316
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:15,829
it but internally within myself I feel

317
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:17,810
more comfortable in my skin now than

318
00:16:15,829 --> 00:16:19,790
what I did in middle school I really do

319
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:23,240
identify with Vietnamese

320
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:25,220
even though like people don't think I'm

321
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,110
gonna me as when they look at me but

322
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:30,319
when they realize that I am data means

323
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:33,529
I'm like I feel very proud like oh wow

324
00:16:30,319 --> 00:16:36,050
you're Viet and I'm like yeah be it and

325
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:39,079
they like inquire and whether or not I

326
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:41,509
can speak it and it's really helped me

327
00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:43,100
at work I've had a couple of patients

328
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:45,860
who are more comfortable speaking

329
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:48,230
Vietnamese than English and so I would

330
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:48,829
work more closely with them so I can

331
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,149
translate

332
00:16:48,829 --> 00:16:51,949
there were times I had to be a

333
00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:54,939
translator even though I'm not like the

334
00:16:51,949 --> 00:16:59,389
best translator in the world it still

335
00:16:54,939 --> 00:17:01,430
made them feel more secure and my work

336
00:16:59,389 --> 00:17:03,680
space than anything else

337
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:06,620
and I love how my boyfriend loves me to

338
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,340
me food like he could eat a bowl like

339
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:10,130
nobody

340
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:13,610
business and he actually eats it the way

341
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:17,660
like like Vietnamese grannies and like

342
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:21,200
mini means like like housewives or like

343
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:23,000
mother just like people who cook but

344
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:25,430
what she did eat it he doesn't put any

345
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,800
sauce in it he like puts the lime and

346
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:30,650
all the vegetables in it but he doesn't

347
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:32,510
put any of the hoisin sauce and he

348
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:34,880
doesn't really put sriracha sauce in

349
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:37,070
there he eats the broth as it is and he

350
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,290
drinks it like there's nothing in that

351
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:43,130
Bowl when he's done he eats all of it

352
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:45,920
number nine what is your favorite thing

353
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:50,570
about being Asian American / your

354
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:53,270
heritage I think my favorite thing is is

355
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:58,150
that it just makes me distinguished it

356
00:17:53,270 --> 00:18:02,750
makes me different but at the same time

357
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:08,050
it makes me feel like me I love how I

358
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:08,050
can like help others of my own ethnicity

359
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:14,780
like in my workplace I love how I can

360
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:18,920
translate and just make them feel more

361
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:20,600
at ease just because I'm Vietnamese or

362
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,700
just because I've greeted them in

363
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:25,640
Vietnamese or because I can speak to

364
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:28,670
them and like I can I can translate them

365
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:33,290
so that's it for this video I am so

366
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:37,550
sorry if it like if it like really puts

367
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:39,020
you guys off like I should have done a

368
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:44,480
different video for like my first video

369
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:46,310
back but I really did what to talk about

370
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,340
this and I really did want to kind of

371
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:50,960
like introduce it if you guys would like

372
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:54,440
to hear more about my family's

373
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:56,720
background and my family story I would

374
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,170
be more than happy to write a blog post

375
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,620
about it

376
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:03,929
I just don't want to be super detailed

377
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:07,830
in this video because it would take

378
00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:12,990
forever and I think I would start like

379
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:14,640
crying if I like went into detail and

380
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:16,590
super detail about it I mean they

381
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,210
started tearing up a while ago when I

382
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:21,750
was telling that story I hope you guys

383
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:24,540
enjoy this video I for sure feel like I

384
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:26,580
am a mess when I edit this I'm gonna be

385
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:29,760

386
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:31,559
