1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,170
a lot of asian-americans talk about how

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:06,210
they can't identify as either Asian or

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:09,900
American but I couldn't really identify

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:11,670
as Asian American or Asian American

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,719
because all of the asian-americans that

6
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,610
were surrounding me were

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,650
chinese-american hello what is up

8
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,600
internet people today I have a very

9
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,490
special video to share with you guys and

10
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,710
that is the growing up as an

11
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:25,619
asian-american tag this tag was created

12
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,570
by vagabond youth so obviously I'm going

13
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:29,730
to be speaking about myself today which

14
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:32,009
is a Vietnamese American which is

15
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,380
different from her video which is about

16
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,300
being korean-american and I haven't seen

17
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,460
any videos like this so far about being

18
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,620
Vietnamese American so if you do know

19
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,239
any other videos that are similar let me

20
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,280
know so I can check it out so question

21
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,890
number one is what ethnicity are you

22
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,840
I am Vietnamese American question number

23
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,030
two which generation are you so my

24
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,670
parents immigrated here from Vietnam so

25
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,379
I'm the first generation born here what

26
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,300
is the first experience of where you

27
00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:00,359
felt that demarcation of being a

28
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,949
minority or different so this question I

29
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:03,930
have a really long answer to because

30
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:06,510
it's kind of two parts the part of me

31
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:09,299
that realized that I was Asian which is

32
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,530
different from being white and the part

33
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:12,420
of me that realized that I was

34
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,610
Vietnamese which is different from being

35
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,890
any other type of Asian as soon as I

36
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,840
entered kindergarten I realized that I

37
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,900
was a different type of Asian than other

38
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,400
Asians because obviously kindergarten is

39
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,830
the first time I was like really

40
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,780
conscious of my classroom setting there

41
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,579
were a lot of other Asians in my class

42
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,500
and there were all Chinese Americans so

43
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:33,180
pretty much people would always ask me

44
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,430
if I was Chinese and I would have to

45
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:38,130
tell them no I'm Vietnamese and at that

46
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,420
age no one knew what Vietnam was so I

47
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,340
would basically have to tell everyone

48
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:44,280
that Vietnam is a different country

49
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,780
besides China and at that age I didn't

50
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,820
even have any concept of really what a

51
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,409
country was but I always told people

52
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,000
that it had something to do with the

53
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:52,619
Vietnam War because I knew that my

54
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,369
parents were refugees and that's why

55
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:55,470
they came here

56
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:57,000
but it was all very confusing for me and

57
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:58,770
all I knew was that all these other

58
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,700
Asians were all Chinese and they were

59
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,890
all different for me

60
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,540
so aside from realizing that I really

61
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,340
didn't have to deal with that many other

62
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,740
times where I realized that I was

63
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,569
different from people up until like high

64
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,340
school and in high school is when I

65
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:13,069
really started to realize that I was

66
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,049
Asian and that's different from being

67
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:17,749
growing up in the town that I did all of

68
00:02:15,049 --> 00:02:19,310
these kids around me from kindergarten

69
00:02:17,749 --> 00:02:21,230
to high school they had all been my

70
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:23,030
friends so I felt like they didn't treat

71
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:24,469
me differently for being Asian

72
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:27,079
however in high school when I was

73
00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:28,670
thinking about my future I was talking

74
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:31,069
to my mom and I said I wanted to be an

75
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:33,319
English teacher and my mom taught in

76
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:34,939
schools before and she kind of

77
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:36,530
discouraged me from being an English

78
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:38,599
teacher because she said that the

79
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:41,239
students that I taught would tell me

80
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:43,450
that my English was poor because I was

81
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:45,829
Asian so back to the point of my

82
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:47,780
differentiating between being Vietnamese

83
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:49,159
or any other type of Asian this was

84
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,230
something that I struggled with for a

85
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:52,819
long time because all throughout high

86
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:55,699
school I found that I couldn't identify

87
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:57,590
with the Chinese kids because they

88
00:02:55,699 --> 00:03:00,709
always went to like Chinese family

89
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:02,449
parties or Chinese school or Chinese

90
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:05,180
dance that was like really popular for

91
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:06,620
all the cool Asians but I wasn't a part

92
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:09,139
of any of that so growing up I didn't

93
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:10,819
have any other Vietnamese friends so I

94
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:12,469
was pretty isolated a lot of Asian

95
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:15,500
Americans talk about how they can't

96
00:03:12,469 --> 00:03:17,709
identify as either Asian or American but

97
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:20,540
I couldn't really identify as Asian

98
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:21,949
American or Asian American because all

99
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:24,049
of the Asian Americans that were

100
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:26,689
surrounding me were Chinese American and

101
00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:28,579
I didn't have really any kind of voice

102
00:03:26,689 --> 00:03:30,409
in that community however I do think

103
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:31,729
that this played a lot into the person

104
00:03:30,409 --> 00:03:34,400
that I am today because it basically

105
00:03:31,729 --> 00:03:37,159
allowed me to form a complete

106
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,199
personality without having to do with my

107
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:42,079
race or ethnicity at all so I basically

108
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:43,939
focus all of my attention into my

109
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:46,099
athletics which at the time was running

110
00:03:43,939 --> 00:03:48,650
track I kind of just built my community

111
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:50,569
around that rather than through my

112
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:52,819
cultural relationships with other people

113
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:54,620
in my school fast forward into college

114
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:56,629
college was the first time that I really

115
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,489
had exposure to other Vietnamese

116
00:03:56,629 --> 00:03:59,810
American friends and it was definitely

117
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:02,419
the first time in my life that I was

118
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:04,699
like wow this is cool like you know my

119
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:06,139
food you know my language however at

120
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:08,060
this point in my life I had already

121
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:10,879
developed such a strong sense of self

122
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:12,709
like without the Vietnamese American

123
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,719
attached to it that I actually found

124
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:16,130
that I had not that much in common with

125
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:18,139
any of these Vietnamese Americans

126
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:19,880
because all of these people too had

127
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:22,699
grown up with other Vietnamese Americans

128
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,529
in Vietnamese communities and I just

129
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:25,500
found that the aspects of my personality

130
00:04:24,529 --> 00:04:26,850
that

131
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,000
we're the strongest were the ones that I

132
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:31,590
developed free from race but other than

133
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,750
that I have a really good experience

134
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:36,150
growing up I really wasn't really

135
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:38,790
bullied by white people for being Asian

136
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:41,520
until actually college which i think is

137
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:43,980
really weird so when I was 18 I was

138
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,290
bullied for being Asian and I feel like

139
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:48,570
that's pretty weird into my adulthood I

140
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:50,130
noticed my being Asian a lot more maybe

141
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:51,990
it's because in the world that we live

142
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,800
in now people are kind of more racist I

143
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,300
don't know

144
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,100
the next question is were you always

145
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,080
proud of your heritage or was there a

146
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,850
time that you rejected it so during

147
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,920
those early years when everyone was

148
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:03,330
asking me if I was Chinese I thought it

149
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,950
would be really really convenient to

150
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:06,810
just be Chinese because then I wouldn't

151
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:08,850
have to explain to everyone what being

152
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:11,880
vain amis is all about I also feel like

153
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:13,710
my family kind of pushed on me to kind

154
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,500
of reject the Vietnamese side of things

155
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:19,350
specifically because with Vietnam at the

156
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,120
end of the Vietnam War my parents and a

157
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:22,800
bunch of other people had to leave the

158
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,470
country because if they didn't they

159
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,660
would literally be killed so for a lot

160
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:30,060
of Vietnamese Americans the Vietnam that

161
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,310
exists today is not the same Vietnam

162
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,930
that it was back then the country was

163
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:36,090
split in two and there was like

164
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:37,710
communist and non-communist people often

165
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:39,750
say it's like north and south but it's

166
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:42,000
not quite as obvious as north and south

167
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:44,700
because there were non communists in

168
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,860
both and the people from one had to flee

169
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:49,200
to the other to be safe from the

170
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,600
Communists basically so anyway my family

171
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,340
is non communist so they had to leave at

172
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,290
the end of the war and then basically

173
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,120
never come back so from an early age

174
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:59,580
they weren't really trying to force

175
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,770
being Vietnamese on to me like we did

176
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:04,530
speak Vietnamese in the house when I was

177
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:06,479
young but as I grew up we just spoke

178
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:08,940
English in the house however probably

179
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:11,070
around third grade or so or whenever my

180
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:13,050
brain was starting to develop into like

181
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:15,660
an independent consciously thinking

182
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:17,460
human being I was really proud that my

183
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:19,440
parents were refugees and I was really

184
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,630
proud of the way that they came to this

185
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,300
country that they survived that they

186
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:26,100
literally came here dirt poor couldn't

187
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,320
even like enter the country had to like

188
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:30,180
work in these terrible terrible jobs

189
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,860
didn't speak the language and they just

190
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:34,050
did whatever they could to build the

191
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:36,479
life that they have now and it was

192
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:38,430
something that I was like so so proud of

193
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,939
the majority of my chinese-american

194
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,949
friend

195
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:43,499
kind of just came here because their

196
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:45,059
families had money and could just move

197
00:06:43,499 --> 00:06:47,520
here and like give them this life

198
00:06:45,059 --> 00:06:49,860
whereas my parents literally had nothing

199
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,449
and we're able to still give me the same

200
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:54,300
kind of upbringing and I honestly am

201
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:56,339
just so so proud of my heritage now what

202
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:59,129
are some stereotypes that you struggle

203
00:06:56,339 --> 00:07:01,110
with so this question is kind of funny I

204
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:02,370
think because I just think stereotypes

205
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:04,110
are like so funny

206
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:06,059
like sometimes I rooted in truth

207
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:07,889
obviously that's like how they come to

208
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:09,900
be because people just make these

209
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:12,749
observations and then say that it's true

210
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:14,969
about a whole slew of people which is

211
00:07:12,749 --> 00:07:16,860
obviously not true but number one is

212
00:07:14,969 --> 00:07:19,319
everyone thinking that I'm Chinese or

213
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:21,719
that all agents are Chinese it's my pet

214
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:23,849
peeve now it's literally like people

215
00:07:21,719 --> 00:07:26,189
know that if they want to make me mad

216
00:07:23,849 --> 00:07:29,069
just call me Chinese or like try to

217
00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:30,960
speak Chinese to me and I know that for

218
00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:32,669
a lot of people it's difficult to be

219
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,550
able to tell different types of Asians

220
00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:37,620
but I also kind of think that you know

221
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:39,599
people my age should definitely be able

222
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:41,639
to tell the difference now at least

223
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,490
between East Asians and Southeast Asians

224
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:46,770
like at this point you should know that

225
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:48,539
like China and Korea and Japan those are

226
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:51,029
like East Asia and that Southeast Asia

227
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:53,430
is like Vietnam Laos Cambodia whatever

228
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:55,020
Thailand but not everyone knows that but

229
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:57,120
I just think it's kind of funny even

230
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:59,399
though it does really annoy me so please

231
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,529
don't ever call me Chinese I also do get

232
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:03,180
like a ton of comments on one of my

233
00:08:01,529 --> 00:08:05,099
videos it's like the only video that

234
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,810
anyone ever watches but the video is

235
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:08,339
about living in New Zealand and so

236
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:10,709
everyone's just like we don't want you

237
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:12,629
in New Zealand go back to China club a

238
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:14,969
lot and I'm just like I literally say in

239
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:16,830
this video that I'm Vietnamese but ok so

240
00:08:14,969 --> 00:08:18,569
the second big stereotype that I have to

241
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:20,550
deal with is everyone thinking that I'm

242
00:08:18,569 --> 00:08:23,669
good at math I decided that I wanted to

243
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:25,680
study math in uni because I was so bad

244
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:28,080
at it in high school you know

245
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,389
Asians are stereotypically supposed to

246
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,839
be like good at math and science in my

247
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:36,870
high school I was placed into honors and

248
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:39,959
in honors I like got seasoned D's and

249
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:41,339
F's and then I overrode again into

250
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:43,680
honors even though they were like

251
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:45,510
suggesting that I go down a level I just

252
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,069
like wanted to be in honors because all

253
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:48,839
the other kids were in honors that I

254
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:49,670
felt like I should be with and just kept

255
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:51,170
getting FS in

256
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:53,210
there was one time that I got like a

257
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:56,030
thirty or something and I just started

258
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:57,740
crying and I was just like why am I in

259
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:59,540
this class and then I dropped down a

260
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,160
level and I realized I was like wow

261
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:03,650
actually I understand all of this like

262
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,540
it's not that I'm bad at math it's just

263
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:07,850
like I was in the wrong level basically

264
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:09,410
and then I realized that like it was so

265
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:11,390
cool to be a math teacher

266
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:12,860
and I just was like I just want to be a

267
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:15,050
math teacher because I want to show kids

268
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:16,640
that it's not that they're bad at math

269
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:18,110
it's just like the way people are

270
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,330
teaching them or the level that they're

271
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:22,640
at etc so basically it was like because

272
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:25,040
I was bad at math that I decided that I

273
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,990
wanted to study math to be able to prove

274
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,780
to people that even if you're bad at

275
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:31,820
something you can keep persevering and

276
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:34,430
you can do better so anyway in the

277
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:37,310
university I'm a math major or I was a

278
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:38,600
math major I've graduated now but the

279
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,520
first thing that you ask someone when

280
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,440
you meet them is like oh so what's your

281
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:44,060
major and I literally would just lie

282
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,100
about my major I would say I'm like

283
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:47,300
communications or nursing or something

284
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,400
because I would never want to tell

285
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:51,620
people that I was a math major because

286
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:54,020
well one I kind of was like yeah I don't

287
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:56,450
want to like be stereotypical Asian and

288
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:58,760
then two I didn't want to be made fun of

289
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:59,990
for actually being bad at math so if I

290
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:02,390
tell people that I'm a math major

291
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:04,640
they're always like oh classic

292
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:07,460
I'm just like what does that mean number

293
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:11,120
three is yellow fever it's the idea that

294
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:13,490
I'm exotic and fun well I am ecstatic

295
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,040
it's fun but not because I'm Vietnamese

296
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:19,010
or Asian but yeah all these guys are

297
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:23,630
like oh you Vietnamese goddess you blah

298
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:25,400
blah blah I'm just like okay there are

299
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:27,530
definitely certain types of stereotypes

300
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:31,160
about what Asian girls should be like as

301
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:33,680
a romantic partner but I am definitely

302
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,720
not any of those stereotypes and I feel

303
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,880
like it's pretty obvious once you meet

304
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,680
me that I'm not submissive the next

305
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:42,710
question is can you speak your language

306
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:45,770
I can speak my language probably at like

307
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:48,410
a third graders level so basically it

308
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:51,500
was my first language and then I only

309
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:53,720
use it to communicate within a domestic

310
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:57,320
household setting so all of the phrases

311
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:59,990
I can say have to do with activities or

312
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:02,720
food so I can say like I'm gonna go to

313
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:04,639
school or can I get a sandwich

314
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,649
I did go to Vietnam for the first time

315
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:09,920
last year and I was able to communicate

316
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:11,870
more or less enough next question is how

317
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,940
has being asian-american affected your

318
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:15,519
relationship with your parents growing

319
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:18,470
up my mom was like a pretty

320
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,720
stereotypical tiger mom but I also was

321
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:22,670
raised Catholic Christian and then she

322
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,160
switched and she became Buddhist and

323
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:27,319
then the Buddhism really affected a lot

324
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:30,620
of my upbringing really really really

325
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:33,350
really shaped the way I think and look

326
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:35,389
at the world now so that was a big part

327
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:38,000
of it and then also during that switch

328
00:11:35,389 --> 00:11:40,610
she kind of switched to and became less

329
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,949
of a tiger mom that tiger mom this was

330
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:44,810
probably necessary as a kid because I

331
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:47,480
think when I was younger I was kind of

332
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:50,449
like a brat but she kind of like

333
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:53,060
disciplined me enough so that I didn't

334
00:11:50,449 --> 00:11:54,769
become like a brat in my adulthood I

335
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:56,240
think if she had kept being really

336
00:11:54,769 --> 00:11:57,860
strict I would have become really

337
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,410
rebellious and that would have like

338
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:03,500
ruined our relationship but she kind of

339
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:05,800
became more understanding and lacs which

340
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:08,810
is kind of part of the Buddhist

341
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:11,000
philosophy is like not being so uptight

342
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:12,920
about things so question number eight is

343
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,769
how do you feel about your heritage now

344
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:18,500
and do you identify with it I 100%

345
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:21,110
absolutely identify with my culture I am

346
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:23,120
so proud of being Vietnamese especially

347
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:25,370
now that I visited Vietnam for the first

348
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,589
time last year I finally feel like I'm

349
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:29,959
not like a poser anymore like I actually

350
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:32,660
am Vietnamese American it plays a huge

351
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:35,300
role in my identity today and in my

352
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:37,339
personality and I think that if you take

353
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,689
away my being Vietnamese I would be a

354
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:40,579
completely different person

355
00:12:38,689 --> 00:12:42,920
and the last question is what is your

356
00:12:40,579 --> 00:12:44,500
favorite thing about your heritage /

357
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:47,059
what is your favorite thing about being

358
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,920
asian-american I think that specifically

359
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:51,620
being Vietnamese American I'm more

360
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:54,079
cultured because in my experience I was

361
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:55,779
the only person that was Vietnamese so I

362
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,189
did have this whole Vietnamese culture

363
00:12:55,779 --> 00:13:00,559
surrounding my family life but then

364
00:12:58,189 --> 00:13:02,899
because I was only one in my whole town

365
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:04,370
I had to learn about all these other

366
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:06,290
cultures so I learned a lot about

367
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:08,360
American culture obviously like all

368
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:10,100
other Asian Americans but then I also
