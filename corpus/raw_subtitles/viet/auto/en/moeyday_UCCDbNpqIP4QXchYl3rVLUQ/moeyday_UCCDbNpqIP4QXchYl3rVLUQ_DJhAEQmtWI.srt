hello what is up internet people so the

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,919
last video I uploaded was sort of a

3
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:09,809
recap of my 22nd year I did a lot of

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,910
travel and I'm going to be doing a lot

5
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:14,309
of travel again this year just realize

6
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,260
that it would be a good idea to take you

7
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:18,240
guys with me and share more of my

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,250
experiences with you so ultimately

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,560
that's my goal in making these videos

10
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,660
but also I'd love for you guys to get to

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,430
know me I'd love to get to know you so

12
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,800
after watching this video please also

13
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,840
give a comment some fact about yourself

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,489
that way I can get to know you guys and

15
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,469
I hope you enjoyed this video my

16
00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:36,510
favourite physical feature about myself

17
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:38,940
is I have two matching freckles right

18
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,530
here and I call them Pikachu cheeks but

19
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,989
yeah it's my favorite physical feature

20
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:46,410
about myself so I was born on the Lunar

21
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:49,140
New Year like I came out into the year

22
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:51,629
of the rat but we consider me a pig

23
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,329
because I was conceived in the year of

24
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:56,309
the pig and I was in the womb for the

25
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:58,829
entire year of the pig so I consider

26
00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:01,859
myself a pig with like some rat

27
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:04,860
qualities similarly in terms of the

28
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:08,070
zodiac I was born on the cusp so a lot

29
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:11,700
of magazines and stuff will say that I'm

30
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:15,180
a Pisces but I was actually born like

31
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:18,720
into Aquarius so I identify as an

32
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,939
Aquarius with some Pisces traits I guess

33
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,960
both of these things make it so I have a

34
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:25,770
split personality

35
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,689
so yeah I'm also wicked indecisive so we

36
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,700
could say that it's because of that so I

37
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:31,350
can pretty much only do board sports

38
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,329
like I used to skateboard when I was

39
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:36,180
younger I started snowboarding when I

40
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:38,490
was in fourth grade I've surfed a lot

41
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,079
but I've never skied in my life and I'm

42
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,060
pretty bad at rollerblading and ice

43
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:46,110
skating I'm allergic to a lot of things

44
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:48,090
including cats dust and birch pollen so

45
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,939
a lot of fruits that are grown in my

46
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,560
area are pollinated by birch pollen so

47
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:56,210
I'm allergic to all of them so pretty

48
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,710
much apples pears peaches cherries plums

49
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:01,469
anything with like skin that's grown on

50
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:03,869
a tree that was grown around here but

51
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:05,549
like if I get foods that were like if I

52
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:07,560
eat an apple that was grown somewhere

53
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:08,789
else that didn't have birch pollen in it

54
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,240
then I'm not allergic to it

55
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:13,550
I actually used to be a scuba diving

56
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,410
assistant laws in college and I'm hoping

57
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:17,720
to get my dive masters in the next

58
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:20,120
couple of years I'm really really easily

59
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,430
motion sick so I throw up almost every

60
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,920
time I fly or I'm on a boat but

61
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:27,590
obviously I love to travel so it really

62
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:30,140
stinks for me and also I love to be on

63
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:32,000
boats because I love diving so pretty

64
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:35,510
much like everything I love also hurts

65
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,760
me I am a certified yoga teacher I'm 200

66
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:39,110

67
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,300
vinyasa

68
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:43,520
I have Grylls I hate being ignored or

69
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,140
ghosted like I know everyone does but

70
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,970
I'm not offended if you're just

71
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,770
straightforward with me and are like I

72
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:51,200

00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,960
peace

76
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:59,210
to my homie so I've also met a lot of

77
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:01,280
other role models slash significant

78
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:05,930

83
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:18,860
love tattoos and I have one right now

00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:59,780
artist I love art I painted that it made

101
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,810
that my favorite artist is Lawrence I

102
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:05,630
just some for work though if you can see

103
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:07,700
but it's pretty dope so she's from the

104
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:09,860
Netflix TV show Tara's house which is

105
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,690
one of my all-time favorite TV shows my

106
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:13,520
other ones would probably be the office

107
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:15,709
and the flash my favorite anime was

108
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,450
Naruto I say that I've been to 20

109
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:19,520
countries because I'm not honestly sure

110
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:22,070
how to count like some different

111
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:25,340
countries so Vietnam Japan and

112
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:28,190
neasha Laos Thailand the US Canada

113
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:30,650
Australia New Zealand Dominican Republic

114
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:32,660
bone Aran Aruba are like technically the

115
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:35,990
Netherlands so I think that's one Spain

116
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:39,590
Mexico the Bahamas Fiji Guatemala

117
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:43,220
England Ireland Scotland I don't know I

118
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:44,150
want to call that one too and then China

119
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,610
and Iceland

120
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:49,430
so Vietnamese was my first language and

121
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:51,590
then English and then Spanish I did for

122
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:53,570
ten years and did an exchange program to

123
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:55,700
Spain and then in college I started

124
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:57,710
learning Japanese and I would someday

125
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,840
like to move to Japan love Japanese

126
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:01,310
culture the language everything about

127
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,110
Japan pretty much it's probably my

128
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:05,450
favorite country there's pretty much no

129
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:07,100
food that I won't eat like one example

130
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:09,320
of a food I don't love is cooked

131
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:12,410
tomatoes like I would rather just eat a

132
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:14,720
tomato raw but I'll still eat it even if

133
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:17,140
I don't like it my favorite cuisines as

134
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,670
a whole are American southern barbecue

135
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:21,410
American Chinese food like crab rangoon

136
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:24,170
sand general GAO's chicken and stuff

137
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:26,090
like I do love like citron food as well

138
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:28,040
but like American Chinese food is its

139
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:30,560
own thing I love that and Vietnamese

140
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:33,740
food however my favorite dishes would be

141
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,300
sushi shepherd's pie and ramen so my

142
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:37,790
favorite dishes don't actually fall

143
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:42,410
under my favorite cuisines I love spicy

144
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:45,410
food I prefer salty / spicy foods with

145
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:47,390
sweet drinks or I prefer to mix like

146
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:50,150
salty and sweet things so like when I go

147
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:52,640
to the movie theater I put sour patch

148
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:54,830
kids in my popcorn and it's fire

149
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,690
definitely try it I'll never just crave

150
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:58,550
chocolate but I'll crave ice cream

151
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:00,620
especially ice cream cake so I don't

152
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:02,720
really like bubbly or fizzy drinks and

153
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:05,150
if I have them I like stir them I've

154
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,300
been catfished before I've met up with

155
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:10,820
people on bumble hinge and tinder I love

156
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:13,370
nature and mountains and like looking up

157
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:16,160
at the sky at night starry sky like

158
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:18,170
definitely a nature person out of all

159
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,180
the nature I think I like the ocean the

160
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:22,220
best whether it's swimming surfing or

161
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,780
diving I just feel really alive when I'm

162
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,430
in the water I love learning about

163
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:27,600
different cultures and meeting new

164
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:30,240
people and learning new things and

165
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,370
new languages I don't believe in regrets

166
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,530
I prefer compliments about my

167
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:36,510
personality rather than my looks the

168
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:39,210
best compliment I've ever received was

169
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:41,820
that somebody called me resilient and

170
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:44,400
that meant a lot to me still does I have

171
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:45,930
friends all over the world but I believe

172
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,730
that the people closest to me and

173
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:49,710
closest to my heart people that know me

174
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:51,210
the best I don't have to see them all

175
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:53,880
the time or even talk to them all the

176
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:56,190
time if I could have any superpower it

177
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,770
would be to take away other people's

178
00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:01,590
pain this was a superpower that Scott

179
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:02,250
had in Teen Wolf Monday is my favorite

180
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:04,470
day of the week

181
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:06,450
I love taking naps I can also fall

182
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:09,000
asleep if it's light out I've had pretty

183
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:10,650
much every hair color and eventually I

fact is that I'm 23 years old it was

recently my birthday and up until this
