1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,600
let's talk about growing up asian

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,240
american

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,080
i'm going to be showing you my like

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,400
struggles of growing up asian american

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,480
the language barrier and everything

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,599
there has been a lot of asian hate

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,839
rising due to

8
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,720
covet i think that's really scary and

9
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,880
sad

10
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,400
so i'm here to show you my experience

11
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,119
growing up asian american

12
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,119
so we're gonna start from the start so i

13
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,960
am half vietnamese and i'm half

14
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,560
chinese i grew up with the vietnamese

15
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,599
culture though

16
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,800
and i didn't really learn any chinese or

17
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,399
anything

18
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,520
and so my first language was vietnamese

19
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:41,120
i would probably say

20
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:44,239
that i'm a elementary level speaker

21
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,399
of vietnamese right now and

22
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,079
i never noticed that the language was

23
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,559
different until preschool

24
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,559
so once i entered preschool i was barely

25
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,719
learning any english so i was very

26
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,399
confused on what the kids were saying

27
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,000
i couldn't really communicate with

28
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,559
others since they were speaking

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
english and i was very confused it was

30
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,159
like this alien like

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,680
language and i think that was like the

32
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,680
first moment where i

33
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,760
realized like something was different

34
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,479
about me and my language

35
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,560
okay heading on to second grade so

36
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,720
starting second grade i kind of knew

37
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,920
english a little but it was still hard

38
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,840
for me i had to like

39
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,439
think about like the sentences i was

40
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,240
saying and stuff

41
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,360
so i remember we had this like parent

42
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,280
conference where

43
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,119
i remember specifically this teacher

44
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,439
said that i wasn't learning anything

45
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,360
i looked like i was spaced out and it

46
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,600
was because i did not understand it was

47
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,520
like i was hearing another language that

48
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,040
it was hard to process and i was trying

49
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,600
to learn another subject

50
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,280
and i remember people like kids who need

51
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,320
extra help get taken out of class

52
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,200
sometimes

53
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,119
to get like extra help i remember having

54
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,880
that and i was very confused on why

55
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,840
everyone is still better at english than

56
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,240
me let's talk about unnecessary

57
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,920
stereotypes so

58
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,600
one of the stereotypes that you are

59
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,399
probably heard for it's pretty common

60
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,119
is all asians are smart and i think this

61
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,000
is a really

62
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,560
unnecessary stereotype that people make

63
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,320
like

64
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,479
oh you get bees i thought you're

65
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,360
supposed to be asian like

66
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,680
it doesn't really make sense and i got

67
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,800
that

68
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,840
a lot growing up racism was

69
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,560
also a problem i had people would be

70
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,080
asking me

71
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,400
if i ate dogs and no i do not eat dogs i

72
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,520
eat

73
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,239
the same thing that every human eats

74
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,319
and i think it's really offensive

75
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,160
someone to say like i remember this one

76
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,519
specific time in

77
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,840
4th grade this kid asked me why

78
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,680
asian eyes were so small and then he

79
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,040
continued to like pull

80
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:46,239
his eyes back and imitate the look

81
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,480
and i was very surprised about this and

82
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,879
i didn't realize how much just goes on

83
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,360
until now thinking about it this happens

84
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,160
a lot

85
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,200
these small comments from here to there

86
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,000
did have

87
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,159
a change or a toll on my perspective of

88
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,200
being asian american

89
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:05,840
um once i was sick my grandma brought me

90
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,400
this meal instead of taking a school

91
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,680
lunch

92
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,120
and it was just like i don't really know

93
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,640
how to describe it but

94
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:18,080
anyways it was this like asian meal and

95
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,080
my i was like kind of ashamed of it i

96
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,080
hate to admit it but i was

97
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,280
and i would be like i don't know what

98
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,519
that is

99
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,319
what is that like you know well what

100
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,120
that is like

101
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,640
pretending not to know what it was and

102
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,080
this was in like

103
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,000
third grade and i ended up not eating it

104
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,400
and i ended up throwing it away

105
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,040
which i feel really bad for sometimes

106
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,480
you would

107
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:45,840
also be called like ling ding like

108
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,799
ching chong like you would actually be

109
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,599
caught that and it's

110
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,280
really sad and surprising that people

111
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:55,200
actually say these

112
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,280
daily to like asian people and i've

113
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,959
experienced some of that like i have

114
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,640
been called some of those names

115
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,920
sometimes and it's

116
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,480
and all of this like asian hate stuff

117
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:10,159
going on with covid like asians being

118
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:14,239
hit killed accused like it's really

119
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:17,359
scary also seeing a lot of

120
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:19,199
like elderly people getting hurt that's

121
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:22,240
like someone's grandma

122
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,759
someone's uncle someone's grandpa

123
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,840
that you're hurting because you're

124
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,240
accusing them of causing the virus when

125
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,040
they did nothing

126
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,840
it's really sad to think of and i hope

127
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,080
this like asian hate stops

128
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,680
and i have also caught myself making

129
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,400
these jokes to myself

130
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,680
because i think that's how i coped with

131
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,160
dealing with

132
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,720
how everything was going on i feel like

133
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,840
we get

134
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,960
so much unnecessary hate and again i

135
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:53,600
am proud of where i'm from now

136
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,160
i really like my culture and everything

137
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,400
i enjoy speaking the language and yeah

138
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,400
that is it i really hope this hates up

139
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,400
soon
