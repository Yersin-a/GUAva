00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,240
hello i went to a thrift store and i got

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,879
a few items

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,120
i went to savers since i think savers is

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:11,200
the best option for clothing

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,960
at a thrift store since they have more

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,280
options than the other stores

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,760
so i went to savers and i found some

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,760
pretty good stuff i am not disappointed

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,760
so i'm going to do a town hall and maybe

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,080
i will do some thrift flips on

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,279
some of these items and so here are my

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,560
items and i'm

13
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:32,000
obsessed i didn't film my trip

14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,640
inside of savers since i'm very awkward

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,719
and

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,200
and i don't think i can handle the

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,600
embarrassment of talking to the camera

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,680
so i didn't really do that but i still

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,399
have the stuff to show you

20
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,760
the first item i found i was so excited

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,399
about this item because

22
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,520
i've been really into quarter zips and

23
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,280
collars

24
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,559
so i was really excited when i found

25
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,640
this top it is

26
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,680
just a plain top it doesn't have any

27
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,600
designs it

28
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:02,160
is a bit smaller than my liking since i

29
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,239
like to wear really oversized sweaters

30
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,799
or sweatshirts

31
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,960
so the zipper works just fine everything

32
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,520
works the collar is a bit weird though

33
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,840
it's a bit

34
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,640
flimsy in a different material but

35
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,560
overall

36
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,200
i think it's the cutest tub and i got

37
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,880
this for around five bucks this is

38
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,759
it that was really awkward

39
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,159
yeah i don't know what i was saying but

40
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,759
let's just focus on this quarter zip so

41
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,759
here's the quarter zip

42
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,920
again with the length i would prefer it

43
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,600
to be much longer and oversized but i

44
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,000
can't really complain because it was

45
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,320
pretty cheap and i found a thrift store

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,400
and yeah i could see myself wearing this

47
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,680
on a chilly day over some like straight

48
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,920
like jeans

49
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,119
and i think this is a really preppy and

50
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,439
nice look

51
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,200
the material is on the thinner side but

52
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,000
that's fine

53
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,200
so next i have this brandy top i have

54
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,560
been trying to

55
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,479
steer close of stairways too close

56
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,399
i don't know but like i have been trying

57
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,560
to get away from brandy

58
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,840
some brandy stuff since i think i have

59
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,040
too much

60
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,000
and i'm trying to have different

61
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:11,840
variations in my closet besides brandy

62
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,599
but i think for for it being like

63
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:18,959
1 4 of the price i had to take it

64
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:22,720
so it's this top there's buttons

65
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,560
on it and it's just it's cropped

66
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,480
but not very cropped at the same time

67
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,800
it's like medium cropped

68
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,959
and yeah i'm pretty surprised that i

69
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,160
found these at the thrift store

70
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,480
okay so here is the top i like it

71
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,239
it is a bit too plain for my liking so

72
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,280
i'm probably gonna use it as like a

73
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,319
layering top

74
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,920
under something else the buttons work

75
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,640
okay i don't know why i said that

76
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,640
obviously buttons do work

77
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,760
yeah i was really surprised when i found

78
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,680
this top since

79
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,239
you don't really often find brandy

80
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,840
clothing at thrift stores

81
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:00,400
it is also a very hugging material

82
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,560
so this is my next find i wasn't very

83
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,239
surprised by the spine since it is a

84
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,959
plain top

85
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,959
and it isn't very fun i did crop it i

86
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,040
forgot a crop on camera but it

87
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,560
is crap since it was a really awkward

88
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,760
length where it wasn't long

89
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,519
or medium at the same time so yeah i did

90
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,159
crop it

91
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,879
but it is a bit boring for me so i might

92
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:25,680
embroider something on it

93
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,319
okay like i said this top is pretty

94
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,799
boring

95
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:32,959
but wait until the end because i'm gonna

96
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:35,599
do like a small thrift flip on this item

97
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,640
material is kind of like a knit thermal

98
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,879
material

99
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,840
when i cropped it it didn't thread

100
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,080
everywhere so

101
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,840
i'm pretty happy with that i don't know

102
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,640
to where to stop in the winter or the

103
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,640
summer time

104
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,319
since it is long sleeve it's cropped at

105
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,360
the same time

106
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:53,920
so on my second saber strip

107
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,120
i found this top oh that's backwards i

108
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,799
found this top

109
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,959
it looks kind of odd on the hanger but

110
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,720
like i promise you it is the sleeves are

111
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,720
a bit tight as you can see i have really

112
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,280
small wrists and they are still a little

113
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,519
tight

114
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,760
but besides that i really like the top i

115
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,000
got it for also five bucks

116
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,840
and just here it is it's from pretty

117
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,040
little thing which i'm pretty surprised

118
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,799
about did you see that

119
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,000
pretty pretty sorry i don't know why

120
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:23,040
this is so weird

121
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,560
okay here it is i'm gonna be doing a try

122
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,000
on haul so i'm not gonna really try to

123
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,560
hold them up as well

124
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,560
since you're gonna see them anyways

125
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,400
here's the top during the try on portion

126
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,240
i kind of hated this top

127
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,600
i was looking at it and it wasn't as

128
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,000
cute as i thought

129
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,479
but i would still wear this i don't know

130
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,560
i'll maybe try to fix it somehow

131
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,880
because i think it's a really awkward

132
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,280
lane i think what got me to get this top

133
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,040
was

134
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,880
when i saw the collar because i've been

135
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,880
really into collars like i said

136
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,919
so i think that's why i got it and i

137
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,840
liked it

138
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:58,080
yeah but like i can definitely see me

139
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:01,199
wearing like mom jeans with this top

140
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,199
i know our gal sweaters are

141
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,880
pretty popular at the thrift store you

142
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,840
can find them there if you are looking

143
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,759
for arthouse

144
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,880
sweater i definitely recommend hitting

145
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,680
up the thrift store

146
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,160
so i found this argyle thing it gives me

147
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,199
very

148
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,039
preppy school vibes vibes

149
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,320
i don't know i always say vibes for some

150
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,360
reason so

151
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,759
here it is i think it is so cute it has

152
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,160
like

153
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,000
this collar which is a little long kind

154
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:30,000
of weird in my opinion

155
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,800
and get this it's motherhood maternity

156
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,800
this is a maternity shirt you can't

157
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,759
really tell that it's a maternity shirt

158
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,680
though

159
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,520
i'm pretty sure i'm gonna be doing after

160
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,520
flip on this i'm gonna be cutting it and

161
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,759
crop cinching it anyways

162
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,400
so i don't think that like bulkiness

163
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,360
look wouldn't be a problem for me

164
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,479
but the design is pretty cute do you see

165
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,919
that it's like

166
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:55,840
three argyle squares are these squares

167
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,360
i don't know my shapes anymore they're

168
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,520
raw misses or

169
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,400
rock or diamonds whatever you want to

170
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,720
call them

171
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,240
they do have a stain right here but

172
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,479
that's not a problem since

173
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,240
i am going to be cutting out the sleeves

174
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,840
since it isn't a full

175
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,759
shirt underneath it's actually just

176
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,880
sewed on to make the illusion

177
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,400
of like underneath polo so i am going to

178
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,160
be cutting off the white part of the

179
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,840
sleeves but not the collar because i

180
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,840
actually like the collar on this shirt

181
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,560
trying on this top i really like the top

182
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,560
and i was really considering not

183
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,479
cropping it but the length was a little

184
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,639
too awkward to not crop

185
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,960
and the sleeves are also really awkward

186
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,919
as you can see so i will be cutting off

187
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,840
the sleeves

188
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,360
i was actually on the hunt for an argyle

189
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,039
sweater you can also find them in the

190
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,720
men's section they have a lot of those

191
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,319
you can crop those or you can just wear

192
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,319
them oversized

193
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,520
and yeah i happen to find this in the

194
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,479
women's section

195
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,120
and this is a pretty good find and it

196
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,319
almost

197
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,639
looks like school uniform

198
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,080
since i didn't buy that much stuff than

199
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,800
i thought i would

200
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,280
so i'm now gonna do like a small thrift

201
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,520
flip

202
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,840
right now so i'm gonna use this top

203
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,880
since it's the plainest top i have so i

204
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,120
already cropped it

205
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,840
but i i'm thinking of doing like

206
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,000
embroidered design on it

207
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,880
so right here i have my pattern that i

208
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,560
printed out

209
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,160
and i'm going to cut it so it's easier

210
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,000
to move around

211
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,840
and then i'm going to use some thread

212
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,960
and i'm going to trace around the

213
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,120
letters

214
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:31,840
after that you would remove the paper

215
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:31,840
and without disrupting the thread

216
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,319
okay so i now finished tracing my

217
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,880
pattern

218
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,680
or my wording and here it is i dabbed it

219
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,319
with water

220
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,199
so it would come out easier and this is

221
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,360
how it looks after removing the paper

222
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,360
and yeah that is the brandy shirt

223
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,199
underneath i actually like this pair

224
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,879
you can see that there's still a little

225
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,960
bit of paper in between the letters

226
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,759
which does come out after you put in the

227
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,039
washer

228
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,759
and i really like this top i think it's

229
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:06,639
a really

230
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:06,639
cool design and yeah that is it
