00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:14,190
hey PCBs so you guys have been sending

3
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:17,070
me so many questions about just various

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:19,470
cooking things like where I get my miso

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:22,320
soup where I get my bowls what kind of

6
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,119
food I like to eat Bullis goes on and I

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,740
thought today I would have lunch with

8
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:29,310
you guys and answer all those questions

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,900
you guys are kind of like my co-workers

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:34,170
in a way since I don't really have any

11
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:36,570
working at home Nate is my coworker but

12
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,239
yes so it would be fun to how much with

13
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,070
you guys and answer some questions for

14
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:43,680
lunch though let me share with you what

15
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:46,980
I'm having I have some bull ball way

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,829
which is a spicy lemongrass Vietnamese

17
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,539
soup it's all the credit for like

18
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:54,030
the Vietnamese beef soup but this is

19
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:57,149
actually one of my favorite soups at

20
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:59,219
home there was a place called gamau that

21
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:02,940
I would always go to with my co-workers

22
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:05,610
and my mom especially but I haven't

23
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,680
exactly found one that I've loved here

24
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,409
yet my favorite thing about Boombah way

25
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,570
is the pork blood I know that sounds

26
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,509
gross and some people hate it but I

27
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:20,040
freaking love it they don't have it in

28
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:23,040
here sad but I will I am still searching

29
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,140
for my favorite soup noodle here in LA

30
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,780
and all the good ones are down in Orange

31
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,640
County so whenever I have time I will

32
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,290
make it down there but first let me go

33
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:36,570
ahead and put all the accoutrements in

34
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:39,630
there we have bean sprouts some purple

35
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:41,970
cabbage I love purple cabbage in my

36
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,520
soups or just cabbage in general because

37
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:46,670
it has that nice crunch in there so good

38
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,680
and then some mint leaves

39
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:51,810
I'm gonna add a lot because it adds a

40
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,729
lot of freshness and it just kind of

41
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:58,860
changes the flavor a little bit making

42
00:01:53,729 --> 00:02:02,490
it fresh and finally a nice douse of

43
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:04,710
lime I always put a ton of lime into my

44
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:08,369
Vietnamese soups whether it's full

45
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:13,290
Boombah way or even crab noodle soup

46
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:15,610
all right stir it up

47
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:19,590
what are you guys having for lunch today

48
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,590
or what did you have for lunch today

49
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:47,380
hmm hmm so my review on this soup it's

50
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:49,989
super spicy so if you guys like spicy

51
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,670
food order this if there if it's

52
00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:53,799
available at the Vietnamese restaurant

53
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:55,930
but I have to say I'm a little

54
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:58,569
disappointed it does not taste like the

55
00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:00,549
authentic one at home the broth is a

56
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:04,150
little bland and tastes a lot of

57
00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:04,480
lemongrass but it does the job for now I

58
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,280
guess

59
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,410
I'm still on the search though so if you

60
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,410
guys have a good Vietnamese restaurant

61
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:14,110
that you recommend in LA please let me

62
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:16,930
know alright so we're gonna move into

63
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:20,980
our question um and this is from youtube

64
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:23,500
from manola s what brand is your miso

65
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:25,870
paste just want to know so I can compare

66
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:29,230
the amount of salt in yours to paste

67
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:32,920
I might get and then Andy Pearson on

68
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:35,019
Facebook also asked I loved miso soup

69
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,209
what is the sodium content I had

70
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:39,750
mentioned in my video that you guys

71
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:42,880
should add just the amount of liquid

72
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:45,819
accordingly for the miso soup because

73
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:49,239
sometimes miso paste can be SuperDuper

74
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:50,410
salty this is the brand that I use it's

75
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:55,090
called

76
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:59,859
Maru comm a organic miso and this sodium

77
00:03:55,090 --> 00:04:03,430
content is actually 710 milligrams for

78
00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:05,980
one tablespoon which is super duper

79
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:07,450
salty you guys to be honest I don't know

80
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:09,970
if I would buy this brand again just

81
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:14,380
because it was so salty the brand that I

82
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:16,959
love is the yellow miso from Whole Foods

83
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:19,000
it comes in like a squeeze packet and

84
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,479
it's just in the grocery aisle so if you

85
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,360
guys ever go there check that one out or

86
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,370
there's also

87
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,800
really good brown rice me so that they

88
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:31,909
keep in the refrigerated aisle next to

89
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:34,340
all the tofu and hummus area have you

90
00:04:31,909 --> 00:04:37,039
guys made the miso soup yet let me know

91
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:39,949
someone else from the miso soup video

92
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:42,379
Brenda Roman from the miso soup video

93
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:44,979
wanted to know is there a substitute

94
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:47,300
you'd use for seaweed for picky eaters

95
00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:49,789
traditionally you would use seaweed but

96
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:52,550
if you have picky eaters I would just

97
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:54,919
leave it out altogether or if they like

98
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:58,099
spinach or kale I would substitute it

99
00:04:54,919 --> 00:05:00,560
for that and then on Instagram a lot of

100
00:04:58,099 --> 00:05:03,229
you guys talked about my sweater that I

101
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:08,090
warned that miso soup videos thank you I

102
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:11,240
love that sweater too D Malta G sorry if

103
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:13,669
I mispronounced it asked I'm a big fan

104
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:16,729
awesome sweater by the way I want to get

105
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:19,069
one like it this sweater is by blank

106
00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:21,680
denim it's called the puppy sweater and

107
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:24,259
I got it from shopbop and a link it in

108
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,900
the description box below I usually make

109
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:29,029
my own lunch at home but like at least

110
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:31,669
once a week we'll try to go out or at

111
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:34,069
least bring food into the house order

112
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:35,870
out just because we want to try all the

113
00:05:34,069 --> 00:05:44,839
food that's available here in LA there's

114
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:47,240
just so many good things mmm this is

115
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:49,669
like a sausage patty that they made kind

116
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,740
of like I call it circle meat it's like

117
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:54,379
jello but they made their own and it's

118
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:56,120
actually really good she's probably my

119
00:05:54,379 --> 00:05:57,889
favorite thing from the soup but there's

120
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,539
just so many good things to try around

121
00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:02,270
here and sometimes it's a hit or miss

122
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:03,949
but I really just like number one not

123
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:05,930
having to cook and number two trying new

124
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:11,229
things I get a lot of inspiration from

125
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:14,000
that okay this is from mrs. Coleman on

126
00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:15,680
Instagram if there was only one

127
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,949
Vietnamese food you could eat for the

128
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:22,449
rest of your life what would it be that

129
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:22,449
is a really hard question

130
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:29,700
I love Vietnamese noodle soups um

131
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:32,250
there's a dish in San Jose from this

132
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:35,850
restaurant called boom cow or a volatile

133
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:38,700
restaurant and it's called Houthi openam

134
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:41,160
said egg I know it sounds sordid I know

135
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:44,040
that's like a mouthful to say but pretty

136
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,380
much it's a noodle soup it's from the

137
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:49,950
central region and they serve it with

138
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:51,600
glass noodles and there's a meat sauce

139
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:54,540
that goes on top of it you can order it

140
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,640
wet or dry and I always order it dry so

141
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:59,880
that it has that meat sauce and it comes

142
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:01,830
with crab like a crunchy deep-fried

143
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:05,100
shrimp thing and just all these

144
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:07,470
different herbs oh my gosh I miss home

145
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:10,650
just talking about that I haven't found

146
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:12,990
anything like that here yet but if I

147
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:14,070
could eat one Vietnamese dish every day

148
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:16,290
for the rest of my life it would

149
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:18,450
probably be that just because it has

150
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:21,750
fresh herbs and all the different

151
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:23,370
flavors land sea glass noodles soup all

152
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:25,260
of my favorite things the soup actually

153
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:27,270
comes on the side so if I wanted to I

154
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:28,040
could like thin it out and just make it

155
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:30,270
my own

156
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:32,100

43

204
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:39,000
what are your countertops called Dzung

205
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:41,370
so this one right here it's a marble

206
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,769
slab and I will link it for you guys in

207
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:45,360
the description box below as well as

208
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:47,670
just a marble slab from Crate and Barrel

209
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,610
and then these are just plain wooden

210
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:52,949
counters a butcher block another

211
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:55,649
question from speechless double zero

212
00:09:52,949 --> 00:09:57,630
what kind of blender was that from the

213
00:09:55,649 --> 00:09:58,230
seven life-changing healthy smoothies

214
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:02,130
video

215
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:04,440
it's the Vitamix s55 it's a personal

216
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:07,170
blender and I love the size of it it's

217
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,300
perfect for two drinks and I use it all

218
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:11,730
the time so again I will link it in the

219
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:14,279
description box below ah another one

220
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:16,709
from the five chia pudding video where

221
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:19,199
did you get the jars I always get this

222
00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:21,660
question you guys I get all of my jars

223
00:10:19,199 --> 00:10:24,149
the little ones are all from world

224
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:26,459
market and it's by a brand called wek

225
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:28,380
jars and I love the shape of it it's not

226
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:30,269
like your traditional mason jar it's

227
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:32,730
like a glass jar that has like a bulge

228
00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:35,820
at the bottom so it's easier to hold on

229
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:37,920
to and they're like 399 apiece so

230
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,240
definitely go check out world market or

231
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,370
I think you can find it at

232
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:44,790
williams-sonoma as well but it takes a

233
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:47,280
while for it to come did did you did you

234
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:49,860

244
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,120
actually really happy with how

245
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,190
everything's going

246
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,500
um we're just trying to work really hard

247
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:16,410
and I want to come up with more fun

248
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:18,330
content to be honest sometimes I do get

249
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:20,400
bored with making recipes all the time

250
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:23,040
which is why I'm doing more of these

251
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:25,140
kind of formats where I talked to you

252
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,660
guys I get bored working alone and with

253
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:30,750
me and baby that's pretty much my

254
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:32,670
coworker and I'm with them 24/7 so

255
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:34,890
talking to you guys and she's building a

256
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:37,560
community on YouTube has been really

257
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:39,660
really great and kind of therapeutic for

258
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,970
me especially since I moved down to LA

259
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:44,310
and don't really have any friends yet so

260
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:47,400
this is not a question but a lot of my

261
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:50,010
Vietnamese viewers often comment or ask

262
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:52,740
me questions in Vietnamese and I just

263
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:54,930
wanted to number one practice it because

264
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:57,930
I do want to teach era see how to speak

265
00:11:54,930 --> 00:12:01,110
Vietnamese and mine's kind of rusty so I

266
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:03,300
think just kind of talking a lot just

267
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:07,110
practicing it with her and hopefully you

268
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:11,580
