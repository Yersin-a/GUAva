1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,950
hmm what else Papa heebie-jeebies it's

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,920
uh and today I just wanted to check in

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:14,099
say hi and give you a quick channel and

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:18,240
life update so the past month was kind

5
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:20,640
of a whirlwind for us we finally got

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,830
some help with air-sea so that we could

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,470
film get some work done but

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:28,199
unfortunately in LA it's really funny

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:31,410
because all the nannies are all

10
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,989
actresses actresses performers so we

11
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,630
loved our nanny but she got another

12
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:40,350
acting job or something that's more

13
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:42,899
aligned with her acting career so she is

14
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,059
no longer gonna be with us which is so

15
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:47,340
sad but we're totally happy for her I

16
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:49,860
know that I'm super supportive of anyone

17
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,199
going after their career goals and stuff

18
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:56,399
so super excited about that but that

19
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:59,070
left us a huge gap in terms of childcare

20
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:02,250
so we finally found someon she's gonna

21
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:05,060
start soon that's why I haven't been

22
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,409
able to update as much in terms of

23
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:09,840
regular content I know you guys are

24
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:12,299
seeing a lot of sponsored content that

25
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,880
was filmed maybe a month ago and I hope

26
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,490
you guys always find value in product

27
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,920
integrations sponsored videos that I do

28
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:21,450
I always try to make it authentic and

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,479
make it real to what you guys would

30
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,369
normally see with the addition of

31
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:29,280
products in there that I personally like

32
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:31,200
and I would totally recommend so let me

33
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,299
know what your thoughts on er are about

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,369
that if you think you are seeing too

35
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:40,500
many on the channel not seeing enough or

36
00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:43,649
that if it's just right I definitely

37
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:46,229
don't want to overdo it in any way and

38
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:48,450
lose you guys lose your trust cuz that's

39
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:50,399
the most important thing to me but like

40
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:54,450
I said these are products that I will

41
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:56,610
always recommend if I like them plus I

42
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,590
think they make pretty delicious recipes

43
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:01,560
too like the almond breeze wanted to use

44
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:04,920
in hummus like who would have thought

45
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:08,429
chef Brooke was so fun to work with and

46
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,289
I love collaborating with chefs and

47
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:11,120
stuff like that because they give me so

48
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:14,180
many new

49
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,180
yes for me I get inspirations by going

50
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:19,430
out there to eat seeing what like the

51
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:22,549
real professionals do and then I come

52
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:25,519
home and I put my home cook spin on it

53
00:02:22,549 --> 00:02:29,120
for you guys so it was nice to have like

54
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:31,459
a celebrity chef professional in our

55
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,180
kitchen doing her things so that was

56
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:34,340
super fun

57
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:38,030
so for fall let's talk about upcoming

58
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:41,420
content that we're gonna be doing so for

59
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:44,180
fall I want to start doing more baking

60
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:48,019
challenges so it's gonna be a mix of

61
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:50,720
like nostalgic items look here I have my

62
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:52,010
mini animal cookie cutters I'm not gonna

63
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,069
tell you guys what I'm doing with them

64
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:58,159
yet cuz I'm still testing and perfecting

65
00:02:55,069 --> 00:03:01,849
the recipes for that video I want to do

66
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:04,730
really fun baking projects I love to

67
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:06,379
bake but it's been so hot here in LA

68
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:09,319
that I haven't really been baking much

69
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:11,359
but once fall rolls around baking is

70
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:13,370
like one of my favorite activities to do

71
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:16,970
another area see is a little bit older I

72
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:19,910
could kind of play with her she has her

73
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:22,310
own kind of like kitchen set that I've

74
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:25,220
recently bought her and she likes to

75
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:26,750
kind of play mix so it'll be really fun

76
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:29,359
for us to play and do that in the

77
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:31,760
kitchen together in which case let's say

78
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:33,709
if we don't have child care how do you

79
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,790
guys feel about having air seat in the

80
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:39,019
video I mean it's not gonna be as like

81
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:40,609
straight-up professional like it

82
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:42,199
normally is we're gonna make it work

83
00:03:40,609 --> 00:03:44,989
somehow and kind of have her in the

84
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:46,699
background but to be honest I have to

85
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:50,720
find a way to make it work for us for

86
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:52,940
you guys and have fun right I have a

87
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,099
feeling she's gonna be a really good

88
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,480
helper in the kitchen cuz all the

89
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:59,419
kitchen toys that I've gotten her

90
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,310
already she loves and I want to say that

91
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:03,980
she learned how to say strawberries and

92
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:06,230
Apple because of her toys because I'm

93
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:11,449
always like Apple here's an apple apple

94
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:13,069
and she'll goes ah oh so cute anyway so

95
00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:16,639
yeah that's one of the plans that I have

96
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:19,190
and then another one talking about chefs

97
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:23,030
and stuff like that I kind of want to do

98
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:24,440
like a baking challenge where I follow

99
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,930
along

100
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:30,949
famous chef recipes and see if they

101
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:32,900
actually translate to home cooks I don't

102
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:35,660
know we'll try it out see how that works

103
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:38,570
cuz for me I still have a lot to learn

104
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:40,460
in terms of cooking technique stuff in

105
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:42,860
the kitchen I am NOT a pro at all I

106
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:46,250
would say I'm a pretty advanced home

107
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:49,580
chef but by no means am i a professional

108
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:52,040
like chef like they do so that would be

109
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:54,020
a really fun challenge for me aside from

110
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:58,070
that I want to keep doing like fall

111
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:59,960
hulls great finds that I have and I want

112
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:02,710
to know I know that monthly favorites

113
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,970
are super popular amongst beauty

114
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:08,570
youtubers but I haven't really done that

115
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:10,250
for baby mom products food stuff like

116
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:12,110
that so what do you guys think if I

117
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:14,330
started doing like monthly favorites

118
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:16,210
like that just to recommend products I

119
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:19,430
know when I post something on Instagram

120
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:21,500
stories I always get questions about

121
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:23,360
where did you find that like where can I

122
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,850
find that bold or where can I find that

123
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,229
plate that bid for air sees so I thought

124
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:29,270
that would be a really fun way to just

125
00:05:27,229 --> 00:05:31,039
kind of package it up together so you

126
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:34,700
guys can have one place to look for

127
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:38,330
things let's see what else we try be out

128
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:42,500
and about content filming outside but

129
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:44,930
just in terms of environmental stuff

130
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:47,870
that we can't control I don't feel like

131
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:50,750
it's up to par with what I want to show

132
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:53,750
you guys like what we've done at home on

133
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:55,820
our channel and what we create outside I

134
00:05:53,750 --> 00:06:00,440
feel like it's always super stressful

135
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:03,260
and it's always not very it's not very

136
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:05,150
put together so I think we're gonna put

137
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:08,180
a kibosh on that for a little bit and

138
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:11,449
then see how it goes maybe I'll be able

139
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:14,810
to do something a little more planned

140
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:16,699
out so that it tells a better story for

141
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,960
everybody and it's not just me

142
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:20,199
scrambling trying to get this footage

143
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,820
here there and then putting it together

144
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:25,690
because that's kind of stressful so like

145
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:29,060
I said this past month was kind of crazy

146
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:32,229
there's a lot of like personal stuff

147
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:35,030
that I've been going through as well

148
00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:36,139
I'll just share it to you guys I went to

149
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:39,020
the doctors today

150
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:43,310
nothing serious but I felt like this

151
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:45,830
bump on my wrist and it kind of freaked

152
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:48,680
me out because finding lumps and bumps

153
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:51,919
on yourself is never a good thing all

154
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:54,949
right so I found it actually two weeks

155
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,810
ago after I was doing push-ups and I

156
00:06:54,949 --> 00:07:00,020
think I might have put too much pressure

157
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:01,789
or something on it because they like I

158
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,419
have this little bump the size of a

159
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:06,020
pimple

160
00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:08,330
so I finally called the nurse and they

161
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:10,819
had me go in and today when I went in

162
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:13,219
basically what happened was that my

163
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:16,430
joints and tendons I guess there was too

164
00:07:13,219 --> 00:07:18,830
much pressure or like overuse of I guess

165
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:22,219
my thumb cuz I'm on my phone too often

166
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:23,960
yeah basically I have a fluid-filled sac

167
00:07:22,219 --> 00:07:27,080
on my bone right here it's called like a

168
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:29,300
ganglion cyst and to be honest it

169
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,129
doesn't hurt too much unless I'm on my

170
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,409
phone so I'm thinking either that or

171
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:36,169
because I was doing push-ups putting too

172
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:38,389
much pressure on my wrist my wrist have

173
00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:40,279
always been kind of weak when I used to

174
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:42,800
be a server I had to wear like this

175
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:45,020
brace cuz I got carpal tunnel from it so

176
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,990
that's kind of a bummer and then I also

177
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:51,379
had food poisoning when we went to San

178
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:54,889
Diego for a mini vacation I don't know

179
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:58,279
what happened but I was pretty much in

180
00:07:54,889 --> 00:08:01,460
the bathroom for most of the trip AJ was

181
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:03,229
it was just awful food poisoning is so

182
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:07,669
worse anything that has to do with like

183
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:10,490
your stomach that whole thing just I

184
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:13,520
don't wish it upon anybody because you

185
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:17,029
just feel so miserable that happened and

186
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:20,180
then I also went to the doctor's earlier

187
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:24,289
in August to get a physical and when

188
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:25,819
they took my blood test my doctor I'm

189
00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:28,939
not sure I'm gonna go back to her I'm

190
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:31,789
not really loving her by the way but the

191
00:08:28,939 --> 00:08:34,279
doctor sent me an a letter saying that

192
00:08:31,789 --> 00:08:36,229
basically that I have abnormal test

193
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:38,779
results that my cholesterol is too high

194
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:42,380
but when I compared it to all of my old

195
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:43,730
tests it actually was going down so I

196
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,440
really didn't understand

197
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:47,600
and so this morning when I went to the

198
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,790
doctor I asked her about it a different

199
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:53,150
doctor about it and she said no your

200
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:55,370
levels are actually all in range I'm not

201
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:57,440
sure why she said that to you did you

202
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:59,360
ask her and I'm like actually I didn't

203
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,580
ask her cuz after that and after

204
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,470
stressing about it I just wanted to get

205
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,850
a second opinion basically I just didn't

206
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:08,390
really trust her anymore

207
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:10,400
so it was really good for me to hear

208
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:13,070
that this doctor thought all the levels

209
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:15,080
are normal and I even went online to

210
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:17,480
search I talked to my sister which

211
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:20,720
coincidentally we have like the same

212
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:23,030
numbers which is really weird but her

213
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,850
doctor says she's in perfect health so I

214
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:28,340
was like why did mine say this anyways

215
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:31,610
the only good thing that came out of

216
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:34,700
that was it made me realize that I need

217
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:37,970
to exercise more so my LDL cholesterol

218
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:42,800
levels were a little higher they were in

219
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:45,950
no shape or form bad at all according to

220
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:49,340
this doctor she says they are lower than

221
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:52,190
your past they're in range but if you

222
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:54,500
are concerned about high LDL levels

223
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:57,460
which is the bad cholesterol I would

224
00:09:54,500 --> 00:10:01,040
recommend eating less animal fat and

225
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:04,220
exercising more so that's exactly what I

226
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:07,730
started doing I started doing the pop

227
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:10,730
sugar fitness videos three times a week

228
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:12,140
for about 30 minutes each if I can't

229
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:14,510
then I'll try to do really like

230
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:16,670
high-impact cardio to get my heart

231
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:18,470
levels up the cardio like cardio has

232
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:21,620
always been a concern for me because my

233
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:24,770
dad's side of the family had such like

234
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:26,840
terrible track record and so many of

235
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:29,570
them had heart disease so that's

236
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:32,150
something that's been always concerning

237
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:34,850
to me and always on my mind so I want to

238
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:37,970
work on that some more and just make

239
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:40,190
sure that I'm in the best shape that I

240
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:43,520
can be whatever I could control so

241
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:46,610
health-wise I'm okay everything's okay

242
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:48,710
this bump either will go away or it'll

243
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:50,570
stay there but if it gets worse then I

244
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:55,370
have to get it drained or surgically

245
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:56,000
removed which is not fun but everything

246
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,800
is Oh

247
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,320
kay and that's pretty much all I could

248
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:04,790
hope for but that's been my health

249
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:07,610
journey in the past month I'm also

250
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:09,560
trying to have a smoothie a day just to

251
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:12,080
make sure I get enough vegetables and

252
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:14,480
nutrients in so that's been another

253
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,770
daily goal of mine and hey maybe I'll

254
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,370
start doing like a smoothie challenge

255
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:21,920
