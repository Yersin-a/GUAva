2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:08,610
hey guys so today I am going to be doing

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,530
the Viette tag it's a bunch of questions

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:13,410
that are about my culture my

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:15,030
relationship to it and I got mostly

6
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,220
these questions from Asia Jackson's

7
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,350
video the Filipino tag and then I just

8
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,539
altered it obviously and then I also

9
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:24,570
watched a bunch of other Vietnamese tag

10
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:26,460
videos so here's ten questions that I

11
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,070
put together for you guys the first

12
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,380
question is do you live in Vietnam no I

13
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,649
do not I have never lived in Vietnam I

14
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:36,630
was raised and lived in America for most

15
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:38,910
of my life and now I'm living in Canada

16
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:41,129
when is the last time you were in

17
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:44,040
Vietnam so yeah I've never been to

18
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:46,620
Vietnam I am a depending on how you

19
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:49,160
define it I'm first-generation so my

20
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,870
parents are immigrants from Vietnam and

21
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:54,059
so I've never been unfortunately but I

22
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,829
would like to go at some point I think

23
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:58,710
for my first time I'd really like to go

24
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:59,430
with my family what part of the country

25
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,090
are you from

26
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:05,369
so my family is from the south my mom is

27
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,290
from Saigon and my dad is from Hanoi

28
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:09,570
what is your Vietnamese name my

29
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,920
Vietnamese name is an out young people

30
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,140
always try to pronounce it and I think

31
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,850
it's something about the ng that they

32
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,920
just like that sound that they just

33
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:20,009
can't really get it means precious jewel

34
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:23,159
so name one of the enemies dish you

35
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:25,229
enjoy the most and why okay there are a

36

time you go to get Vietnamese food you

40
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,090
can try these out because I'm sure you

41
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:35,729

42
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:38,729
these before so boom do is definitely my

43
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:41,400
favorite noodle dish by far um bun gang

I really like I usually fry it I slice

45
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,829
it thin and then fry it and then eat it

46
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:49,140
with sugar or soy sauce okay Wow sorry I

47
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:51,030
had to just look up really quickly what

48
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,310
it was because I know what these things

49
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,810
are by sight and I can describe it to my

50
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,090
mom and she'll know what it is either

51
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:59,520
order it for me or make it for me but um

52
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:02,340
yeah it escaped my mind but bang boom

53
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,399
bang boom is my favorite oh my gosh it's

00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,439

I named like four different things you

56
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,530
can honestly eat them at like different

57
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:12,510
times of the day you just have like a

58
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,650
whole egg Vietnamese food adventure you

bun me as a snack boom um ya know my mom

62
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,870

63
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:26,909
one day I would love to open a

64
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:30,030
restaurant with her she made some dank

65
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:32,010
food um I have a spring roll video with

66
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,540
her actually on my channel so you guys

67
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:35,939
can you go check that out I'll link it

68
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:39,000
here okay do you eat pho on a regular

69
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:41,430
basis uh no I do not even when I was

70
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,620
growing up at home I did not eat pho

71
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:46,139
regularly we do eat it quite a bit but

72
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:49,379
um it takes a really long time to make

73
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:52,230
the broth and so I don't know my mom

74
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:55,079
just wouldn't make it all the time but

75
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:57,030
we do eat rice every day so named to

76
00:02:55,079 --> 00:03:00,030
Vietnamese household items that best

77
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:01,769
resembles our culture you can't have a

78
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:04,319
Vietnamese household without fish sauce

79
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:06,900
and I know it does not smell great like

80
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:10,200
if you have this spill on you disgusting

81
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,540
so gross um but it tastes so good and

82
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,709
it's just like such a complex mix of

83
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,180
flavors like I don't know why I'm

84
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:16,920
discarding fish sauce you guys just go

85
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:20,069
and try it if you haven't before and

86
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:22,470
then also I would probably say having a

87
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:24,269
ton of Buddha's in your house I know

88
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,639
that not all Vietnamese people are

89
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:28,230
Buddhists but for me growing up not in

90
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:29,879
Vietnam these are just some of the

91
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:31,739
things I kind of differentiated my

92
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:34,019
household from other people's households

93
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:35,879
yeah there's a lot of like teachings and

94
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:37,379
stuff that obviously if you guys are

95
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:38,879
familiar with Buddhism that are very

96
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:41,849
well integrated into just like your

97
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,769
everyday life and the way that you live

98
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:46,470
your life is not so much worship and

99
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:48,810
this one actually is so awesome um my

100
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:51,090
dad bought this when he was living in

101
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:54,239
New York in his 20s and he was actually

102
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:57,209
a candle he's this cute little green wax

103
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,849
Buddha um so I loved him I convinced him

104
00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:03,449
to let me take him with me to Vancouver

105
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:04,979
and so he lives with me now oh and bonus

106
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:08,159
artifact four things you have in your

107
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:10,319
house you have DVDs of body but I it's

108
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,579
like a like a show I don't know how you

109
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,019
describe it it's like a variety show

110
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:15,599
kind of so there's like a lot of singing

111
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:18,180
and acting skits and like stuff like

112
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,829
that but it's really big in the

113
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,810
Vietnamese community everyone watches

114
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:24,690
fairies but I do you know how to speak

115
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:27,620
Vietnamese if so say a Fraser - okay so

116
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:30,210
on this topic of language

117
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:32,850
growing up first-gen there was not a

118
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:35,580
huge demand for me to retain my language

119
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:38,820
and I really really wish that there was

120
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:41,370
because the American Way is to

121
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,500
assimilate into the culture um speak

122
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:45,270
English it's not really until I got

123
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,660
older that I started to realize like

124
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:51,270
that is wrong um and I really wish that

125
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:53,370
I was fluent in Vietnamese because it

126
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:54,930
was my first language and then once I

127
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:58,800
started schooling then English quickly

128
00:04:54,930 --> 00:05:01,800
became my dominant language and so my

129
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,290
parents will speak via list to me and I

130
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:07,710
will respond in English so the phrases

131
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:10,890
that I do know are all commands hi Babu

132
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:13,230
hyung come I always say that a lot the

133
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:16,290
Adam Yauch oh I'm good I don't know why

134
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:18,150
I would know that your dad let me see

135
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:20,250
I'm gonna try and say like hi my name is

136
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:27,350
Nina let's see what other basic

137
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:37,970
information I got Iago Jojo ah done ah

138
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:51,870
don khong La Nina um um hi MIMO boy ah

139
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:54,780
ah oh how God how God deal am ah cun lam

140
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:57,060
YouTube yeah so that's kind of

141
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:59,400
embarrassing but that is my proficiency

142
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,410
level I can understand a lot more than I

143
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,600
can speak and I think it's just because

144
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:05,640
I've practiced listening a lot more than

145
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,040
I have practice speaking and I cannot

146
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:11,490
read at all honestly like this is really

147
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:14,160
really sad like I would like one day to

148
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:15,720
learn this language um and be able to

149
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,340
speak it fluently or as fluently as

150
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,950
possible and I think the only way that I

151
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:22,890
can do that is to move to Vietnam and be

152
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:25,740
there for a while so we'll see what is a

153
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:28,620
stereotype about Vietnamese people so I

154
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:30,540
would say for Vietnamese women a Hondo

155
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:33,090
Hondo it's like you work at a nail salon

156
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:35,010
or you own a nail salon there is a

157
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:38,430
stereotype that Vietnamese people gamble

158
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:39,820
a lot and I would say that's like kind

159
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:42,010
of true

160
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:43,660
and all our family gatherings there's

161
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:46,270
always gambling but that's like honestly

162
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:48,400
the funnest part so like yeah there's a

163
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:50,700
downside to it but it's also like kind

164
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,700
of true

165
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,680
so my last question is what is your

166
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:00,470
favorite thing about being gay nummies

167
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,420
and I would say definitely the food we

168
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:04,490
have amazing food and it's honestly so

169
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,660
diverse like the food from the north is

170
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,310
very different from the south just

171
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,320
because obviously geographically and

172
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:11,900
just different styles of cooking and I

173
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:14,210
would also say having like close family

174
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:16,940
ties I know that this is true for a lot

175
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:19,880
of Asian cultures I don't know immigrant

176
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:21,860
cultures in general but I grew up with a

177
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,990
very strong sense of like family first

178
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,910
that was honestly very nice for me to

179
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:27,980
grow up knowing that and just have that

180
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:29,960
value yeah and I don't know I think I

181
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:32,870
really like I didn't really think about

182
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,700
Buddhism all that much growing up but as

183
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:36,770
I've gotten older side.you realized that

184
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,390
a lot of the things that my parents are

185
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:40,280
preaching to me are a lot of Buddhist

186
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:42,530
teachings and that I'm really grateful

187
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:44,840
for because I've grown up in this

188
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:46,100
mindset of like gratitude so that's all

189
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:49,130
the questions that I had for this via

190
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:50,840
tag feel free to take these questions I

191
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:52,250
have them posted below and I mostly just

192
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,350
want to make this video because I know

193
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:56,600
what it's like being Vietnamese being

194
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:59,210
Asian growing up in America or someplace

195
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,770
where you are different at the end of

196
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:03,350
the day like that's the reality of it

197
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:05,210
like a lot of people that I know a lot

198
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,860
of people that I've grown up with have

199
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:09,380
grown up with this idea that we are

200
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:11,060
somehow inferior or that we shouldn't

201
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:13,010
take pride in our culture but our

202
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:15,020
culture is beautiful just like so many

203
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:17,570
other ones out there I grew up with this

204
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:19,460
kind of mentality of combating

205
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:22,040
mainstream culture and like black is

206
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:24,560
beautiful black girl magic and that's

207
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:27,320
very very very much in conversation in

208
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,020
the last couple of years and I feel very

209
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:32,390
blessed to have been a part of this time

210
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:35,000
period and even though like I can't

211
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:37,400
really identify with black girls or

212
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,110
black idols it was still really great

213
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,300
for me to see other people of color

214
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:43,280
getting some like attention and

215
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:46,160
spotlight for all their amazing beauty

216
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:48,500
and talent and it's really interesting

217
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,530
because growing up my idols were always

218
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:53,060
women of color and right now like I

219
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:54,440
would say that my biggest idols

220
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,690
especially when it comes to fashion

221
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,660
beauty it's really strong independent

222
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:03,380
black women it's Rihanna

223
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:06,810
zendaya Michelle Obama but I would

224
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:08,279
really love to see Asian Americans

225
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:10,470
I can look up to that I can identify

226
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:12,840
with there's certainly a lot of people

227
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:14,490
making strides in that direction so yeah

228
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:17,010
I did not mean for this video to get all

229
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:18,450
political oh that was not my intention

230
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:20,490
and I don't want to speak controversial

231
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:22,890
honestly it shouldn't be because this is

232
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:24,660
my experience and that's all I can speak

233
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:26,400
from and I know for a fact that there

234
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,650
are other young people out there whether

235
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,839
or not you're Vietnamese um but that

236
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:33,770
feels strange in America in whatever way

237
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:36,900
whether it be race gender sexuality

238
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:38,730
whatever it is um I know that there are

239
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:41,070
people that feel estranged but just know

240
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:43,290
like if anything from that you take from

241
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:46,020
this video just know that you deserve to

242
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:48,270
be here you deserve to be an American

243
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:50,400
you deserve to be a Canadian whatever it

244
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:51,960
is that you identify as you don't need

245
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,200
somebody else to tell you that's who you

246
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,000
are

247
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,430
I was literally told when I was eight

248
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,110
years old that this girl would not be my

249
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:00,839
partner because I was not American and I

250
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:01,740
believed it until I was I think in like

251
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:03,270
fifth or sixth grade

252
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:07,380
something like it so my teacher was like

253
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:09,120
no girl you American um and so that's

254
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:12,240
really really damaging especially do

255
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,650
sense of self and I don't want people to

256
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,660
grow up with this idea of like

257
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:17,220
self-hatred or that you can't be proud

258
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:22,620
of your culture and I really hope that

259
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:24,540
this was insightful um but I hope that

260
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:27,530
you have a lovely day and I will talk to

261
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:33,350
