1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,509
hey guys so I am filming my first ever

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:08,160
Q&A slash gets no me video I figured it

3
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:10,740
was kind of fitting it just because I am

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,019
back in this room where it all started

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,059
so I do have my pen because I have my

6
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:16,920
little notebook not little but I have my

7
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:18,690
notebook where I wrote down a couple of

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,060
questions and then on my phone I have

9
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:24,570
some questions that I screenshotted from

10
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,980
my Instagram Q&A like I just posted a

11
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,840
photo and I was like hey I'm going home

12
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,029
for those of you that want to ask me any

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,710
questions please feel free to do so so

14
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:33,090
for the future you need to communicate

15
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,219
with me through there because I actually

16
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,380
am very responsive through Instagram

17
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,180
more so than I am through YouTube just

18
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,489
because I am on that app a lot more so

19
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,170
yeah follow me on there for future like

20
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:44,550
Q&A type things

21
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,260
I don't know so these are just a couple

22
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:50,430
of ones that have gotten kind of

23
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:53,640
repetitively throughout my videos and so

24
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:55,800
my name is Nina when my first started my

25
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,859
youtube channel I was like I need a cool

26
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,989
name for my channel so somehow I came up

27
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:02,640
with usually suspect I have a no idea

28
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:04,890
what that is supposed to mean also my

29
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,900
dad just are drilling downstairs oh ah I

30
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:10,110

suspect I think it's supposed to me I

32
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:15,330
don't know I was just looking at puns or

33
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,740
something and I came back to it after a

34
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,700
couple years and I was like that means

35
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,770
nothing to me

36
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,369
I want a channel that resembles Who I am

37
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:25,439

00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:27,180
spin my nickname for the longest time so

39
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,040
I am really happy with the name that I

40
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,259
settled with it is very simple to the

41
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,079
point I'm gonna ask my dad to stop

00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:36,810
drilling okay where was I sorry I just

43
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,090
had to ask my dad to just put a pause on

00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,369
the drilling for about an hour just so I

45
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,259

46
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:44,520

53
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,210
Columbia I've got my question a lot it

54
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,530
is very nice I think just to know that

55
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,799
like people do care about what I'm

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:10,259

my parents are fully Vietnamese I do

58
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:14,020
have some Chinese up in there

59
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:16,390
somewhere I have like maybe I think it's

60
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:18,880
like Cambodian I have some Cambodian but

61
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:21,580
like very small amount I was born in

62
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,740
Toronto we moved to San Francisco when I

63
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:26,530
was very young and I was raised in San

64
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:28,420
Francisco here not in this house

65
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:31,090
actually in an apartment in the

66
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:34,150
Tenderloin and I have lived here up

67
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:35,140
until now I am in Vancouver that's where

68
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,900
I spend most my time

69
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:40,750
I am only home about 20 days out of the

70
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:43,750
entire year and after that who knows so

71
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:45,220
I get this question a lot and I figured

72
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,540
that it's probably because some of you

73
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,370
out there want to start your own

74
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:51,340
channels which I highly recommend you do

75
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:53,500
but I have a let's see it is sorry I'm

76
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:57,190
just reading it right now um it is a

77
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:59,470
Canon Rebel t5i the lens that I'm using

78
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:01,330
is just the one that came with the Canon

79
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,010
I don't actually know that is if I'm

80
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:08,010
reading it off the lens right now it

81
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:10,600
says Canon zoom lens EFS 1855 millimeter

82
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:12,100
and a bunch of random numbers I don't

83
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,050
know if that's relevant to anyone but

84
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:16,080
yeah so that is the camera that I am

85
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:18,700
using that is all like the base

86
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:24,090
questions that I kind of get throughout

87
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:26,830
my channel and moving on to my Instagram

88
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:28,239
Q&A thank you so much for everyone that

89
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:30,610
did ask me questions I didn't get a

90
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,380
whole ton but I kind of anticipated that

91
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,120
because I am not actually sure how many

92
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,769
people on my Instagram actually watched

93
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,870
my YouTube videos but I do appreciate

94
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:40,150
everyone that did asking questions thank

95
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:42,610
you so the first one came from calm

96
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:44,799
juice box and she said hi this is a

97
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:46,720
question for your Q&A video how and why

98
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,820
did you end up going to Canada for

99
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,840
college also videos are awesome thanks

100
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:54,640
Thank You Colin juice box so I ended up

101
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,549
going to Canada for a couple of reasons

102
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,049
but for me personally I am dual citizen

103
00:03:57,549 --> 00:04:01,540
so that means I am both Canadian and

104
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:03,100
American so having dual citizenship

105
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:07,660
means that going to school in Canada I

106
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:10,060
pay domestic which is dope for those

107
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:13,239
guys that are live in America you know

108
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:15,070
that college is expensive so when it

109
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:17,350
came down to it it was really financial

110
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:19,120
it was either I go to University of

111
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:21,609
British Columbia or I go to Occidental I

112
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,389
got the most aid from Occidental but I

113
00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:27,689
also like just

114
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:29,370
the domestic rate in Canada was just it

115
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:32,789
kind of equaled out to be about the same

116
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:34,860
as about 20,000 I want to say per year

117
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:36,900
and that's still pretty extensive but a

118
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,129
lot cheaper than a lot of other schools

119
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,740
that I applied to because I applied to a

120
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:42,810
lot of private universities and I also I

121
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:45,719
never had a first-choice school but I

122
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:48,150
was the most excited to get an

123
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:49,590
acceptance letter from UBC like I

124
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:52,379
remember coming in the mail and I was so

125
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:54,030
excited and looking back um when I was

126
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:55,740
trying to make my decision that is kind

127
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:57,509
of what indicated me that I want to go

128
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,969
there that was just my gut telling me

129
00:04:57,509 --> 00:05:02,129
that UBC was the place for me so yeah

130
00:04:59,969 --> 00:05:06,659
that is how I ended up going there for

131
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:09,780
college okay next question is from Tara

132
00:05:06,659 --> 00:05:12,090
fro Nina I love your channel thank you a

133
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:15,090
question for your Q & A what is your

134
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:16,229
favorite movie of all time okay so since

135
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:17,669
I've got this question I've thought

136
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:20,099
about this a lot and for some reason

137
00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:21,360
this has been the most like frustrating

138
00:05:20,099 --> 00:05:24,930
question for me to answer because

139
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,879
honestly I don't know I enjoy a lot of

140
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:28,500
genres I love animated movies I love

141
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:31,680
comedies rom-coms

142
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:33,210
action what-have-you so based on movies

143
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:38,520
that I come back to over and over and

144
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:40,949
over again that's the thing there isn't

145
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:44,699
one I'm not I'm not really big on

146
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:46,560
rewatching movies so that's that's kind

147
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:48,029
of a hard indicator but I definitely do

148
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:55,080
watch them where I'm like Sam that was

149
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:57,750
great so let me think um a I'm Shannon

150
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,159
named a couple for you guys so I really

151
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:01,650
enjoy Kill Bill

152
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:03,870
I enjoy the first one more than the

153
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:06,120
second one really hope that there's

154
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:08,490
going to be a third one but I really

155
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,860
really really enjoy the Kill Bill series

156
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:13,080
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs let's

157
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,909
just mix it up a little bit um when this

158
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,440
movie came out it was my favorite I've

159
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:18,330

161
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:23,370

183
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,880
doing like a whole routine for my face

184
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:18,820
let's be honest I don't really need all

185
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:21,010
of that and so all use is Cetaphil and a

186
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:22,780
moisturizer the moisturizer that I'm

187
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:24,880
using right now is skin to shangri-la

188
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:29,710
from a lush but prior to that it was

189
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:31,450
like a your snow moisturizer and that

190
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:33,430
was pretty good too it's just obviously

191
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:36,340
really really expensive and I'm not

192
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:38,980
working for you or anymore so um can't

193
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:41,410
afford that so yeah that is what I use

194
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:43,660
for my face at the moment but watch out

195
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:45,430
for a video at some point soon because I

196
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:48,430
will be making one with all the products

197
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:50,440
that I do use including scrubs and stuff

198
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:53,110
like that ok so next question that I

199
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:55,630
received is from Genevieve Smith Oh 3

200
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:57,790
she asked how do you stay organized and

201
00:07:55,630 --> 00:08:02,170
manage time and what is your favorite

202
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:05,800
thing to do to pass time so I have tried

203
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:07,990
so many methods over the years I use

204
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,150
written planners like paper planners I

205
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:12,730
don't have mine now because I am back

206
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:14,140
home on vacation but I've used numerous

207
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:17,110
different planners and those work pretty

208
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:19,690
well except I end up writing everything

209
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:20,920
in there like my to do things my events

210
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:24,010
that I have to go to meetings have to go

211
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:25,930
to meal plans and so it ends up getting

212
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:28,240
really really messy but I do recommend

213
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:30,040
writing stuff down somewhere so whether

214
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,600
it be in a planner or notebook I can

215
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,490
never remember everything that I have to

216
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,260
do off top of my head and when I'm not

217
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:37,150
using a planner or anything then I do

218
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:38,990
tend to double booked people which is

219
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:40,820
really really bad her

220
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:42,589
second question was what is your

221
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:45,470
favorite thing to do to pass time and

222
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:47,330
see honest it is making YouTube videos I

223
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:50,720
don't have a lot of free time I have

224
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:53,120
school I have work and I have a social

225
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,160
life like I came home from all my finals

226
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,709
and I was like yes I finally have time

227
00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:00,500
to just knock some stuff over I finally

228
00:08:57,709 --> 00:09:02,570
have time just relax and do stuff for me

229
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:05,630
and so I went straight to editing videos

230
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:08,750
and it doesn't feel like work even

231
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:10,520
though it is so a much work that is my

232
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:14,270
favorite thing to do kind of as sad as

233
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:16,190
it is it's just more work so yeah thank

234
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:18,050
you for your questions Genevieve the

235
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:21,170
last question that I got from my

236
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:22,850
Instagram DNA is from Ryan shoutouts

237
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:24,140
Ryan you guys have seen him in my a week

238
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:26,029
in my life if you haven't seen that

239
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,260
already check it out I am really proud

240
00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:29,480
with how that turned out

241
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:31,730
he is the one that was dancing a lot the

242
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,010
person that is not me dancing a lot he

243
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:35,959
asked how do you think being a youtuber

244
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:38,209
has changed and will change your life

245
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:41,510
this is actually a really good question

246
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:44,089
because honestly like this is all very

247
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:45,800
timely I'm about to hit 10,000

248
00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:47,930
subscribers which is unreal I did not

249
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:50,240
think that I would get here in this

250
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:54,170
short amount of time when I started I

251
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:56,060
had about a hundred two hundred

252
00:09:54,170 --> 00:10:01,250
subscribers and that was after I was

253
00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:03,230
making uhm Beauty videos and I felt like

254
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:05,810
when I was making those videos I wasn't

255
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:07,850
really expressing myself in the way that

256
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:09,830
I wanted to I was kind of just miming it

257
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:12,440
and doing the motions that other people

258
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:14,060
do on YouTube and just kind of I was

259
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,830
another face out there there wasn't

260
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:18,260
anything that I was really showing you

261
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:19,610
that was me and I keep saying like over

262
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:21,350
the Pat like over the past couple years

263
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:23,510
I kept saying I'm gonna go back to it

264
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:24,950
I'm gonna keep doing YouTube again I'm

265
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:27,680
like I really enjoyed doing it whatever

266
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:30,680
and I do I really really love doing this

267
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,810
but I was never super proud of the work

268
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:35,810
that I put out and that is just because

269
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:37,399
I wasn't really being myself I was being

270
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:38,899
a version that I thought you guys wanted

271
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:40,320
to see like somebody that you guys

272
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:44,760
wanted to see

273
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:48,090
and so YouTube has given me a place to

274
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:50,160
be creative and to really be myself I

275
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:51,660
like there are no words to describe how

276
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,990
amazing that's been because YouTube has

277
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:57,090
given me this outlet and I know that so

278
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:58,800
many other youtubers say this but really

279
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:00,060
like I don't I don't think until you are

280
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,430
in this position until you're putting

281
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:04,470
out content and then having it received

282
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:06,750
well you can really really understand

283
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:08,850
what that feels like and I didn't come

284
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:11,130
to YouTube for acceptance that's not why

285
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:13,740
I'm here I am here so that I can put out

286
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:15,690
content that I am proud of and that are

287
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,220
helpful for you guys I don't want to put

288
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:19,050
out anything that's generic which is

289
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:21,240
what I was doing before I want to put

290
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:23,730
out stuff that really comes from the

291
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,870
bottom of my heart and I want to talk to

292
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:28,050

really thought of or providing some

other kind of outlook or worldview that

298
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,490
