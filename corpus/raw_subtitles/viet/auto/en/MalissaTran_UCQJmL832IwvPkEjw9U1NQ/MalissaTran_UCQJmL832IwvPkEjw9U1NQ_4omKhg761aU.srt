1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,279
hey guys my name is Melissa and today I

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,309
wanted to share my experience growing up

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:10,620
as an Asian American I'll start off by

4
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:13,469
just kind of saying that I am Vietnamese

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:17,039
and Chinese I'm three quarters enemies

6
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:19,320
and one quarter Chinese my dad is full

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,020
venes and my mom is half so she speaks

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,449
Vietnamese Chinese and English my

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:27,330
parents came to America in the 80s and

10
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:29,250
they moved to Seattle had my brother and

11
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:33,030
then had me Vietnamese was my first

12
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,829
language and I obviously spoke it a lot

13
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,480
within my family especially my dad's

14
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:38,879
family they all spoke Vietnamese with

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,520
each other and my grandparents didn't

16
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,230
know English so that's all I knew when I

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,210
was growing up up until when I was in

18
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:48,660
about preschool that's when I started

19
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:51,780
learning English and I had to speak to

20
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:54,750
other people obviously I was so shy but

21
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,910
so I learned English through daycare and

22
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,899
then elementary school grade school I

23
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:02,910
kind of learned how to speak English

24
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:04,890
really well started to forget Vietnamese

25
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,990
I formed kind of like a language barrier

26
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,760
between my grandparents and me it was

27
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,619
really hard because I thought it wasn't

28
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,330
fair for me to always have to speak

29
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:14,490
Vietnamese at home or know how to speak

30
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,500
when everyone spoke English my family

31
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,020
also looked down on the fact that I took

32
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,909
English during family parties and things

33
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:24,479
like that and they're like kind of

34
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:26,130
shaming me for not knowing my native

35
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,770
language there was a point in my life

36
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:31,140
when I was young I was really proud to

37
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:34,020
be Vietnamese I'm an eighth birthday I

38
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,909
wore a traditional Vietnamese dress and

39
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,189
oh yeah for my party I learned how to

40
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:40,079
read and write in Vietnamese and I still

41
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:42,360
know to this day I still hold that like

42
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,280
very dear to my heart because of the

43
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,380
things that people said in school they

44
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,420
made fun of me for the things that I ate

45
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,220
or the smells that were coming from my

46
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,380
lunch box sometimes it would be judged

47
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:55,409
by that and I was embarrassed so I just

48
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,180
chose not to share that part of myself

49
00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:00,210
to the world I knew that I was different

50
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:03,030
in elementary school when they assumed

51
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:06,110
that I was really smart and good at math

52
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:09,599
I personally didn't take it offensive

53
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:11,879
just because I was good at math and I

54
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,800
was a smart student so I was just like

55
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:15,000
yeah that's just who I am I

56
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,430
didn't realize that they were kind of

57
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,920
making the general assumptions and

58
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:21,480
stereotypes because I was Asian I just

59
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,670
thought it was because of who I was I

60
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,980
didn't really experience prejudice until

61
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:27,900
middle school high school when people

62
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,930
always assumed always exceeded

63
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,790
expectations and education because of my

64
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:35,490
parents and they assumed that it was

65
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:37,530
because I was Asian and that they were

66
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:40,470
really strict on me but in fact I didn't

67
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:43,380
feel like I had a lot of pressure like

68
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:45,000
other Asian parents might have put on

69
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:47,310
their children just because my parents

70
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,970
are always kind of like do your own

71
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,220
thing you know

72
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:52,260
you know you know what you have and what

73
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:55,380
your people love and stuff so I never

74
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:58,830
felt pressure from that I think the most

75
00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:01,700
pressure I receive for meeting high

76
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:04,770
expectations of like the typical Asian

77
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,270
was from the society that I was growing

78
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:08,880
up in when I was like in the middle

79
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:12,750
school I remember I brought my lunch and

80
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:15,960
I was eating a sandwich head bread Mayo

81
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:17,520
and then the shreds of pork and it looks

82
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,190
like hair it's kind of like just

83
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,570
shredded up and I just ate that for

84
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:24,030
lunch all the time is my favorite thing

85
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:26,220
to eat and I remember my friends are

86
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:29,070
like oh my god Melissa is eating hair

87
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,510
and almost like it's not here it's my

88
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,890
food but I didn't know what it was

89
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,540
either I didn't even know how to say it

90
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:36,270
in English and so I was like I don't

91
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,890
know what to call this but I just number

92
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:39,480
people thinking it was weird or like

93
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:41,010
sometimes I'd bring stuff that was like

94
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,320
leftovers and people would think it was

95
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:45,330
stinky so I was just like really

96
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,860
embarrassed and that's kind of like the

97
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:48,540
first indicators that I knew I was

98
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,040
different than other people I grew up

99
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,230
with a lot of white friends I didn't

100
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,060
really realize that I was only one it

101
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:56,010
kind of opened my mind she listened to

102
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,600
you you know country music and like pop

103
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:58,320
music and things like that and I was

104
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,550
really into it

105
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,650
I didn't make the connection that was

106
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:03,570
Asian an American until I was in like

107
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:06,540
high school and maybe that's a little

108
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:08,970
slow paced for someone like me but I

109
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:11,760
didn't recognize that I was an Asian

110
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:14,070
living in America I guess I think what

111
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,200
taught me that was when my own cousins

112
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:18,450
were kind of shaming me for not knowing

113
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,919
Vietnamese and not knowing Chinese and

114
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:22,229
stuff and I was like okay well I grew up

115
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,550
in a predominantly white community like

116
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:24,780
what am I supposed to do where am I

117
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,730
supposed to learn that the town I grew

118
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:28,830
up and barely had any

119
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:30,510
but I feel like there's also the stigma

120
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:32,280
especially in high school when I started

121
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:33,990
hanging out with more Asians they're

122
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:40,110
like oh you're part of like the Asian

123
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:41,910
group and stuff and I'm just like so I

124
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:43,200
just didn't understand it high school

125
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:45,240
was when I started hanging out with

126
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,560
Asians more I think it was just

127
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,120
naturally because I felt like I

128
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,830
connected to them more and I understood

129
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,780
more about their culture in their

130
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:54,960
background and they understood me more

131
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:56,370
and then other people who weren't Asians

132
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,790
would be like oh you're part of the

133
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:01,920
Asians like okay let me live

134
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:05,160
I felt like kind of embarrassed still

135
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:07,080
even at like 17 18 years old and I don't

136
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,690
think I felt really comfortable in my

137
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:13,410
skin being asian-american and shell I

138
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:16,140
was in college and I was applying and

139
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:18,690
you know colleges are like oh we like to

140
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:20,430
keep our campuses really diverse and I'm

141
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:23,250
like hey that's a plus for me because

142
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:24,900
they're gonna want more diversity that's

143
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,520
when I was like okay I kind of have like

144
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,470
a little bit of an upper hand because

145
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,570
I'm Asian and whatever and then I also

146
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:33,240
was able to kind of be the face of my

147
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:36,060
college so I went to you to Bothell and

148
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,610
the photographer for the little ads and

149
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,990
stuff like that were going around and

150
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:42,210
they came across me and they were like

151
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:44,820
hey do you want to be photographed for

152
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:47,190
the u-2 bottle like pamphlets and stuff

153
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:48,330
and I was like sure so I thought it was

154
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:50,250
really cool that I was able to kind of

155
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:51,810
represent my college in these little

156
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,460
pamphlets that they're handing out to

157
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,690
new prospective students so I thought

158
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,930
that was really cool and I was like

159
00:05:54,690 --> 00:06:00,630
proud to represent you know a colored

160
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:03,750
person on a pamphlet in a college when I

161
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:07,260
first went to Vietnam my very first time

162
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:09,120
I was 22 I had blonde hair so I know I

163
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:11,700
stuck out like a sore thumb but when I

164
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,320
was in Vietnam people were automatically

165
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,210
assuming I was American and didn't

166
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,730
understand Vietnamese mind you they're

167
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:20,220
kind of right I only probably speak

168
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:22,470
maybe equivalent to like a 3rd grader I

169
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:24,930
can kind of get by I can kind of order

170
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:26,970
but I understand pretty well when I went

171
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:28,380
there I wanted to try my Vietnamese you

172
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:30,030
know and I feel like they just

173
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:32,310
automatically seemed I didn't know it

174
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:33,780
and then when I did speak Vietnamese

175
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:37,169
they were super surprised and they're

176
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:39,539
like whoa you speak Vietnamese but your

177
00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:41,580
and I was like yeah I'm Asian American I

178
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:43,349
can speak a little bit of both I came

179
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,909
home and I realized that like I didn't

180
00:06:43,349 --> 00:06:46,620
really fit anywhere because I'm too

181
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:48,870
Asian to be American but I'm too

182
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:51,539
American to be Asian so it was just like

183
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:53,460
a weird crossbreed and I had kind of

184
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:58,349
like an identity crisis because I was

185
00:06:53,460 --> 00:07:01,020
like okay why don't you will accept me

186
00:06:58,349 --> 00:07:03,539
anywhere you know I'm 26 now I can have

187
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,580
the best of both worlds I can be

188
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:07,439
American and I can be Asian and I can be

189
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:09,569
proud to be both I am proud to be both

190
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:11,699
I'm trying to really hold on to my roots

191
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:13,529
and hold on to my culture because it's

192
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:15,689
really important to me that I'm able to

193
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:17,699
pass that down to my children in the

194
00:07:15,689 --> 00:07:20,129
future my parents I feel like didn't

195
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:21,719
understand the culture the American

196
00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:23,520
culture when they came here and so when

197
00:07:21,719 --> 00:07:25,589
I grew up in that culture they were like

198
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,300
why are you like this you know when I

199
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:28,499
grew up I wasn't able to do this this

200
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,180
and this I didn't have a boyfriend I

201
00:07:28,499 --> 00:07:32,129
didn't get to go out it was just a

202
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:34,319
really different world going up ahead to

203
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:36,479
kind of learn for myself like where my

204
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,999
spot was in the world and where I was

205
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,610
able to kind of feel comfortable and

206
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:43,259
safe and represented going up Asian

207
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,360
American I don't think I'll ever take it

208
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:47,939
for granted because it kind of formed

209
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,649
and shaped me to be Who I am and I'm

210
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:51,330
proud of that I'm able to kind of stand

211
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:54,029
up for myself now where I wasn't before

212
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:57,020
I wasn't able to identify I guess or

213
00:07:54,029 --> 00:08:00,569
really stand up and be confident in my

214
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:03,389
Asian as' but I think now that I'm older

215
00:08:00,569 --> 00:08:05,939
I'm able to really embrace the culture

216
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:07,770
and embrace that I am Vietnamese I am

217
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:09,509
Chinese I am American I think that's

218
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:12,449
what is so great about America is that

219
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:15,120
we are it's a melting pot and even

220
00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:17,669
though there are so many differences in

221
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,399
our country right now I think everyone

222
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:23,039
should embrace and accept that our

223
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:25,469
country is made of so many different

224
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,389
backgrounds and it's not ever going to

225
00:08:25,469 --> 00:08:29,099
look like one person want to make that

226
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:31,469
