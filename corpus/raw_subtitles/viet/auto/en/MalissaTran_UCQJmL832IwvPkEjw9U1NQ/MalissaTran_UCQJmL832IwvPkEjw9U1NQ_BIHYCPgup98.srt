00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,700
hey friends my name is Mel and about a

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:07,770
year ago I made a video called live

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,110
after college and tips on dealing with a

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,420
struggle so this day it is still in my

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,490
most popular videos and I think the

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,199
reason why is because a lot of people

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,090
can relate to the topic people are still

8
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,279
damning me and messaging me up about

9
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,170
this topic and certain conversation and

10
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:23,519
sharing their stories and the kind of

11
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,439
struggle that they've been going through

12
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,300
and I feel like it's been super helpful

13
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,599
because we're both kind of getting

14
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,759
through it together and I just feel good

15
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,200
knowing that I wasn't alone and so I'm

16
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,760
hoping other people are feeling the same

17
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,149
way I kind of wanted to make an update

18
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,460
video on my life as of now in the past

19
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:43,410
year and what I've been kind of going

20
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,760
through to get myself out of the rut I'm

21
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,070
hoping that this video will kind of

22
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,920
inspire others and hopefully help them

23
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,360
in their situation last year as I said

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,390
in that previous video I was super

25
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,910
depressed and I wasn't happy with my job

26
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:59,430
so I made the decision to quit my job

27
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,980
and travel for the summer and kind of

28
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:04,379
find myself clear my head a little bit

29
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:07,380
and narrow down what I am truly

30
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:09,000
passionate about what I really want to

31
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,650
get out of life and how I can go about

32
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,600
achieving it once I was kind of

33
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,430
traveling and exploring and meeting new

34
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,409
people it made me realize what was

35
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:19,310
important back home and what wasn't big

36
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:21,750
part of why people don't leave their

37
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:24,060
jobs that they're unhappy about is

38
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,040
because of money and when I was

39
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,049
traveling I kind of realized that money

40
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,970
is so insignificant in the grander

41
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:33,270
scheme of things because it gets you by

42
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:38,280
it's a house over your head and food on

43
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:39,960
the table but honestly I had a start

44
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,000
from scratch and I feel like I

45
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,820
sacrificed so much and a huge part of it

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,490
was money I got back for my trips and I

47
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:51,390
was faced with okay what am I gonna do

48
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:54,180
now and I just started going in on

49
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:56,399
applications I was applying like no

50
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,909
other day after day after day I was

51
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,490
getting rejections I was revising my

52
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:05,460
resumes and nothing was happening for me

53
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:10,170
for months I hit a really really dark

54
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:13,740
place and I was so distraught because I

55
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:16,050
couldn't figure out where I could go

56
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,930
really felt like everything I worked so

57
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:21,210
hard for was going down the drain time

58
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:24,300
was passing and I was just sitting there

59
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:26,160
it's just stagnant and not knowing what

60
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,630
to do it really really it takes a toll

61
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:33,360
on the your mental health I feel because

62
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:35,910
I began to feel so much anxiety and

63
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,380
depression I honestly like there are

64
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:39,570
times where I wouldn't get out of bed

65
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,310
because I just didn't know like what was

66
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,960
I was like what is the point of me

67
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:45,750
getting out of bed what is the point of

68
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:48,720
me doing these things why even you know

69
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:51,870
why why why I think what got me through

70
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,980
is knowing that I really really trusted

71
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:58,080
in myself even though I had nothing

72
00:02:54,980 --> 00:03:01,410
basically I mean I moved back home with

73
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:05,910
my mom I didn't I obviously didn't have

74
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:07,770
an income I had no experience I felt

75
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,970
like things were just hitting dead and

76
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,950
one after another

77
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:13,860
what company positive was knowing that I

78
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:15,390
trusted myself and knowing that I did

79
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,400
have a lot to offer and even though I

80
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:19,860
didn't necessarily know how to narrow it

81
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,560
down to words or even a job description

82
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,450
I knew that I was capable of doing a lot

83
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,120
of things trusting myself really got me

84
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:29,490
through and when you're in that kind of

85
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,130
state you spend so much time alone you

86
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:34,440
think a lot about who you are and you

87
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:37,230
really break down the core values of

88
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,690
what you believe in nothing humbled me

89
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:42,600
more than being able to kind of sit

90
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:45,000
there by myself and really dissect my

91
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,990
values and core beliefs for months when

92
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,260
I was depressed

93
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:51,330
i sat at home I looked up as many

94
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:53,880
opportunities as I could I had a small

95
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:56,490
in my pod for so many things and I I

96
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,170
feel like I had this mindset that made

97
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:01,530
this certain amount so I had to make

98
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:03,360
more than what I was making before and I

99
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:05,400
just knew that it had to be better man

100
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,959
did that knocked me down a couple pegs

101
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:12,300
because I really had to realize that I

102
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:15,900
was starting from scratch I was starting

103
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:17,880
from zero experience education was there

104
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,890
but it wasn't necessarily going to help

105
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:23,250
me in this situation

106
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:25,530
I applied to the simplest of things like

107
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,050
I even applied to administrative work I

108
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:29,300
wasn't even trying to do that

109
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:31,550
I was applying for other psychology

110
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:33,139
roles even though I wasn't trying to do

111
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:34,789
that anymore I just was so desperate

112
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:38,659
that I needed a job then I stumbled upon

113
00:04:34,789 --> 00:04:41,150
an internship for a fashion / social

114
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:43,940
media intern it was going to help this

115
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:46,039
personals personal shopper in her social

116
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:47,539
media for me the one thing I really have

117
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:50,599
been working on I guess in the meantime

118
00:04:47,539 --> 00:04:53,360
was blogging blogging taking photograph

119
00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:55,490
doing social media embracing any little

120
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,610
opportunity I could get to have

121
00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:00,740
experience in some way so my social

122
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:03,440
media experience helped me get that

123
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:06,409
internship and even though it was unpaid

124
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,599
it was in my mind experience so that I

125
00:05:06,409 --> 00:05:11,000
could you know leverage that on my

126
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:13,129
resume to hopefully appeal to at least

127
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,870
one other person one employer and

128
00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:17,539
through her I was able to network so

129
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:19,280
much and I met a lot of people and I was

130
00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:21,770
lucky enough to kind of connect with

131
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,229
them to you and I went to events with

132
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:25,550
her I filmed things for her and took

133
00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:28,039
photographs and other people would

134
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:29,930
notice me and say like oh are you a

135
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:32,650
videographer are you photographer even

136
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:35,719
though I wasn't I I said that I was yeah

137
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:37,759
that helps me gain other gigs you know

138
00:05:35,719 --> 00:05:40,039
just faking it till I made it

139
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:42,949
through them I was able to kind of start

140
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:44,900
booking gigs photography gigs and just

141
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:47,090
doing here little videos here and there

142
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,620
that was just kind of the start of what

143
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:50,840
was to come if I'm starting to value

144
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:52,580
myself more I feel like other people are

145
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,740
going to value me as well I started

146
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:56,870
getting emails I started getting gigs I

147
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:59,659
booked my very first photography gig I

148
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:02,690
booked my first video gig and from then

149
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:05,719
I'm still kind of working on that it has

150
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:08,449
been such a goddamn journey I feel so

151
00:06:05,719 --> 00:06:11,690
happy doing it I feel so so blessed so

152
00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:13,909
I've been working towards that in the

153
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:15,979
meantime while looking for other jobs I

154
00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:18,139
applied to Yale I applied to start up

155
00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:21,289
then opportunities started to come I

156
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:24,680
started applying again I continued to

157
00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:27,919
work my ass off I applied to one company

158
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:30,319
that was looking for an assistant buyer

159
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,210
they just needed someone who had retail

160
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,389
experience working with negotiations

161
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:36,680
being able to communicate with people

162
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:38,360
things like that I was thinking okay I

163
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,820
don't know if I have the experience for

164
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,100
it but I'm gonna try anyway

165
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:44,920
through this whole process and interview

166
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:47,320
a test another interview and then

167
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:49,510
another interview or set process it

168
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,980
lasted two whole months the last and

169
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:53,230
final interview I go along with the

170
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:54,820
interview is really well and I felt like

171
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:57,130
it just really clicked for me felt

172
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:58,630
promising so I wasn't going to put all

173
00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:01,480
my eggs in that basket because I still

174
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:04,870
wasn't sure but I just I felt prominent

175
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:07,330
I was patient and then this week I got

176
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:09,370
the call that I got a job offer oh my

177
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:13,030
god I had tears streaming down my eyes

178
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:16,060
it's been a whole year and I've worked

179
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:17,830
so hard it was finally paying off they

180
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:20,380
recognized you know what I could offer

181
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:22,330
to them and they even actually liked

182
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:24,430
that I had a psychology degree because I

183
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:26,290
was able to communicate with multiple

184
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:27,820
people and kind of get an insight on

185
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:28,510
people with different backgrounds I

186
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,700
guess so

187
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:33,460
that really helped actually in my

188
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:35,440
experience in this job position so even

189
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:38,350
though the job itself has nothing to do

190
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:41,110
with psychology my degree helps I can't

191
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:44,230
even tell you how happy i frickin feel

192
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:45,730
now going from a dark place to finally

193
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:48,130
getting your first gig your first

194
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:50,590
opportunity meeting people and then

195
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:52,720
finally landing that job I could cry

196
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:54,280
right now I feel really emotional right

197
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,560
now good great to look back at how far

198
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:59,230
I've come from that person last year who

199
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,450
is so depressed huh I could say it's

200
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:03,460
been a crazy year I want to show people

201
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:06,070
that good things can happen and you

202
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:07,780
don't have to stay in a shitty job you

203
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:09,760
don't have to stay in it for money you

204
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:14,020
don't have to stay in it you know

205
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:17,010
because it's safe I think what pushed me

206
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:20,080
was getting out of my comfort zone and

207
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:22,480
being so vulnerable and myself that I

208
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,250
had to do it I'd had to do you know I'm

209
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,380
hoping that sharing my story will

210
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:28,720
motivate and inspire other people to

211
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:31,570
chase their passion there are a million

212
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,570
reasons why you shouldn't but I think

213
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:37,870
just having one really big good reason

214
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:42,550
why you should is enough to jumpstart

215
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:44,260
your life in achieving happiness so I

216
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:46,570
want to share five tips I've come up

217
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:48,340
with that can hopefully help you find

218
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:49,960
your passion regardless of how many

219
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:51,700
people say no and how many people doubt

220
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:54,700
you my first tip I

221
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:57,670
is don't limit what you are capable of

222
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,780
don't limit yourself to saying I can't

223
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,850
do this because I don't have the

224
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:03,160
experience I don't know enough people or

225
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:04,630
I don't know where to start if you limit

226
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,760
yourself then you're only gonna be

227
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:09,460
capable of that much believing that you

228
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:12,070
can do anything in the world I feel like

229
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:14,830
is enough to any possibility the second

230
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:18,400
tip is to be willing to sacrifice a lot

231
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:22,510
so I sacrifice where I was living having

232
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:26,800
a steady income I sacrificed my ego my

233
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:28,540
third tip is to don't be afraid to push

234
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,570
yourself out of your comfort zone and

235
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:32,980
just go for it if you are always gonna

236
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:35,170
be comfortable you're never gonna know

237
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:37,030
what is out there you never know what

238
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:39,250
new things could come you can't find a

239
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:41,590
solution being in the same place you

240
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,730
found your problem or something that I

241
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:44,920
don't know if that's the right quote I'm

242
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:46,840
sorry but my forced tip I have is to

243
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,910
take time to reflect to yourself and

244
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:51,130
just figure out what you really really

245
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:53,050
want what you're capable of what you

246
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:55,270
want to offer what you are willing to

247
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:57,820
risk and give up for this narrowing down

248
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:59,950
or just the basic basic core values of

249
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:01,690
what you really want is gonna help you

250
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:02,980
so much in the long run because you

251
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:05,230
realize what is important to you and

252
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:07,990
what is it the fifth and final tip I

253
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:10,180
have is just trusting in yourself trust

254
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:11,920
that you will get out of this if you

255
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,870
know what kind of person you are for

256
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,840
example me I know that I can't be in one

257
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:18,910
place at once I know that so I know that

258
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:21,010
I'm not gonna always be in this place I

259
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:23,080
wasn't gonna be someone who wanted to

260
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:25,000
stay stagnant and I wasn't gonna let

261
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,760
myself you can't achieve what you want

262
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,220
out of your career out of your life out

263
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,260
of your goal I hope this video helped in

264
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:34,600
some way for you I know that it was kind

265
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:36,160
of jumbled and I feel like I can go on

266
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,620
and on and on about this topic you have

267
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:41,350

270
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:47,980
difficult and even more difficult is

271
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,450
trying to pursue it if you're not in
