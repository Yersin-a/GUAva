00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
hi children my name is cameron cao

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,960
welcome back to my channel

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,560
and if you're new here consider

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,000
subscribing watch my other videos and we

5
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,760
can have a fun time together

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,160
well except for it now this is kind of

7
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,519
serious or this is very serious

8
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,000
um to me this topic is extremely

9
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,439
hard to talk about because with the

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,080
current political climate

11
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,519
and everything that's going on right now

12
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,119
i personally feel

13
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:30,800
very heartbroken to see

14
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,960
all the hate and stigma against

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,960
you know just asians in general and it's

16
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,880
just really heartbreaking to see that

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,000
and i thought because even if i have

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,840
just

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,360
like my channel is like extremely tiny

20
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,000
like not even 100 subscribers but

21
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,399
if i just can at least get out a small

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,440
like

23
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,520
word or something

24
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,600
that can spread the message and hope we

25
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,000
can come to a mutual understanding

26
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,000
and work to become better in the future

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,800
i hope i can do that

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,120
i just think that with all the things

29
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,640
like

30
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,320
last year with black lives matter and

31
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,680
then now everything that's going on with

32
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,360
in the asian community

33
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,439
i think it's really important that we as

34
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,680
people of color poc should at least

35
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,760
learn also have a mutual understanding

36
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,920
of each other's pain and struggles and

37
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,640
not go against each other or

38
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,280
try to compare each other when we all

39
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,520
have

40
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,280
our own different struggles and everyone

41
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,320
has their own experiences to tell and

42
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,400
stuff like that

43
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,080
i just hope that this video will be able

44
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,720
to at least if you

45
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,720
or someone you know has these types of

46
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,240
opinions or negative opinions or stigmas

47
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,840
against other races and

48
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,000
people of color maybe this video will

49
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,560
help you at least understand our point

50
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,040
of view

51
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,280
and stuff like that i personally can't

52
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,759
also deny i have my own stigmas against

53
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,600
other races and stuff like that growing

54
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,640
up in an asian family obviously they're

55
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,840
going to be stereotypes that your

56
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,399
parents always tell you

57
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,360
i think most asian kids growing up with

58
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,640
like you know

59
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,640
uh parents that are immigrants that came

60
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,680
from around the vietnam war korean war

61
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,479
stuff like that

62
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,920
can understand this like with you know

63
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,960
my mom is always telling me oh

64
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,280
don't go near mexicans or don't go near

65
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,560
indian stuff like that when it's really

66
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,239
just

67
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,080
people just living their lives and of

68
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,040
course there's a bad seed in every

69
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,319
single race

70
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,440
it's not like it's because you're white

71
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,319
doesn't automatically make you a white

72
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,760
supremacist

73
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,599
or something like that it's just with

74
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,360
the type of stigma it's really hard for

75
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,640
people to break it since it's such a

76
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,200
generalized thing

77
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,000
and stereotype among other people and i

78
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,640
hope i'm

79
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,319
i hope i make sense because i've never

80
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,840
been that much of a person to speak out

81
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,560
on certain issues i'm more of a person

82
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,280
who like

83
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,440
does things quietly like for me i during

84
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,200
black lives matter i never really posted

85
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,800
anything on my instagram never really

86
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,800
spread too much of awareness

87
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,599
i did things more quietly like i would

88
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,519
just donate secretly or

89
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,599
would uh sign petitions and stuff like

90
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,360
that or have conversations with people

91
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,360
but i never went out of my way to do

92
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,280
anything like that which i

93
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,720
severely regret and i wish i did more

94
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,599
considering now what's happening with

95
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,159
asians i

96
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,959
now generally understand that i should

97
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,560
have done more

98
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,159
now that i see my people my own

99
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,239
community suffering

100
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,680
and that's hard i really understand and

101
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,280
i hope people can also come to that

102
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,200
realization

103
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,560
i get though some people don't want to

104
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,640
post things because you know

105
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,920
political things sometimes people i know

106
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,879
a lot of people have ruined their

107
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,560
relationships

108
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,560
over political topics and stuff like

109
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,000
that and it's just

110
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,680
with that type of climate it's really

111
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,879
hard to like really speak out about it

112
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,599
because you're afraid of the judgment

113
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,200
you're gonna get

114
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,640
because you can't please anybody or you

115
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,799
can't please everybody

116
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,720
you're either going to please one party

117
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,720
and lose once person or you're going to

118
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,640
praise that person and then end up

119
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,480
losing a whole other

120
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,560
group of people so i'm just going to

121
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,360
begin off with my personal experiences

122
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,360
if that is okay

123
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,720
i this day before i'm vietnamese

124
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,400
american i was

125
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:55,599
born in june 2004 or june 13

126
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,200
2004 and i was raised here in southern

127
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,959
california and if you didn't know

128
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,879
southern california or specifically the

129
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,920
oc area

130
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:06,480
has a large vietnamese population i was

131
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,760
lucky enough to grow up in that area

132
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,280
of oc where there's a lot of asians and

133
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,560
vietnamese people i went to an

134
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,920
elementary school that

135
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,959
had mainly only asian kids so i never

136
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,479
really growing up

137
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,479
felt like different or felt really like

138
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:23,680
discriminated in that aspect since when

139
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,960
i was a little kid

140
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,000
all my classmates were basically

141
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,960
vietnamese if you look through my

142
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,639
yearbook

143
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,000
i'll even post like a little thing of my

144
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,560
yearbook and block out everyone's names

145
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,560
it's like just

146
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,639
or try and try and try and transfer if

147
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,280
you know what i mean

148
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,479
so for me it's always just like oh you

149
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,759
just that's

150
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,680
that's how it's always been there's a

151
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,600
bunch of asians everywhere i didn't

152
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,120
really think that america was mainly

153
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,919
white people because in the community i

154
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,080
grew up with

155
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,360
it was mainly asian people so for me i

156
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,960
never understood

157
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,639
the concept of america as a white

158
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,280
country because i was like oh all the

159
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,240
classmates

160
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,919
are asian so everyone else every other

161
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,080
school must have more asians too

162
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,080
it wasn't until i reached middle school

163
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,400
and then i found out differently but

164
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,840
in elementary school i lived pretty you

165
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,520
know normally

166
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,120
i am all my classmates are asian so we

167
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,639
never really had to feel anything weird

168
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,680
about how we brought our lunch to school

169
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,759
and stuff like that

170
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,960
i know sadly this isn't the case for a

171
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,680
lot of people

172
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,880
growing up here but i was i'm i honestly

173
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,280
think i'm very grateful

174
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,759
that i had that you know chance to grow

175
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,520
up and live with other vietnamese kids

176
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,280
as we could speak our language without

177
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,160
having to be like mocked or anything

178
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,320
like that

179
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,919
we could share our food and not really

180
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,759
give any like weird like

181
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:39,039
oh what's that i was like oh you're

182
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,039
eating fa oh i

183
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,880
something like that you know so it's

184
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,000
never been really too much of a big

185
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,400
issue for me

186
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,400
so as a kid i was like oh life is great

187
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,080
and even we had like a couple white kids

188
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,039
couple black kids in my classes

189
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,800
or hispanics for the most part they

190
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,880
became asian washed so it's kind of like

191
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,479
the opposite effect surprisingly enough

192
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,000
but

193
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,080
that wasn't until i went to middle

194
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,240
school i really started to

195
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,520
realize more about racial indifference

196
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,639
and stuff like that

197
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,880
because for me i've noticed that for the

198
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,880
asian kids in my class i know

199
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,560
i personally don't say it but i do know

200
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,280
that plenty of asian kids

201
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,039
have said the n word and stuff like that

202
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,759
starting middle school because at the

203
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,039
time

204
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,560
we didn't really have that many black

205
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,319
people around we didn't really know the

206
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,400
connotations of what it meant

207
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,360
or stuff like that so for the most part

208
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,600
people my age

209
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,520
we found it funny we were 11 to 13 year

210
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,680
old 13 years old we didn't really know

211
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,759
any better we just thought it was funny

212
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,199
we heard it in rap songs stuff like that

213
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,919
and i'm not trying to justify it i'm

214
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,199
just saying as

215
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,639
children we didn't really know any

216
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,080
better since we didn't grow up around

217
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,160
those types of people

218
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,440
leading to us thinking it was okay along

219
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,360
with sometimes

220
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,440
majority part asian parents do say it

221
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,160
too which is why i must also

222
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,639
for us we assume it is okay so at the

223
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,400
time

224
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,560
most of us whenever i heard it i was

225
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,560
like

226
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,400
i never really understood the any racial

227
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,000
implication behind that

228
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,160
it wasn't until though i actually faced

229
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,680
my own sort of discrimination

230
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:13,120
i was walking around um

231
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,960
uh the beach area hb and uh

232
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,720
when i was walking around there i saw a

233
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,440
group of white kids they looked at me my

234
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,440
brother

235
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,440
and then they started making oh ching

236
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,840
chong and did this

237
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,199
and then me and my brother for me though

238
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,720
they were making it towards my brother

239
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,000
since i

240
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,639
do not have those kinds of eyes or i

241
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,599
don't have

242
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:38,319
the tip i don't i don't have the

243
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,919
i don't have you know my eyes are bigger

244
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,440
than a normal asian so i've never really

245
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,120
gotten that type of like feeling where

246
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,800
they did this and stuff like that

247
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,479
it was but it was targeted towards my

248
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,520
brother and my brother felt really bad

249
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,080
because of it and

250
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,680
that's when i kind of realized that

251
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,360
isn't okay you're not asian

252
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,319
but the same time though for a while it

253
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:59,280
was really normalized for me because

254
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,759
you know i think most immigrant parents

255
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,520
or

256
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,960
most kids living with immigrant parents

257
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,280
know that their parents

258
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,520
have like some type of gratitude towards

259
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,240
um white people in a sense where my mom

260
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,560
is always like

261
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,400
oh they let us into our country we owe

262
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,520
them a lot of things

263
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,360
so they have that you know

264
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,879
you know white savior type of thing

265
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,560
which is why i'm assuming some

266
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,160
white people have that type of complex

267
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,080
because of stuff like that

268
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,360
which i can understand from my mom's

269
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,680
point of view

270
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,400
how it's like to escape from a war-torn

271
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,840
country

272
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:34,320
to go to america where

273
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,240
here they where they finally get

274
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,320
somewhere else to go

275
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,839
so in turn they feel grateful for that

276
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,399
and i can understand that at the same

277
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,399
time though

278
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,159
it's kind of made it normalized in a way

279
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,440
how

280
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,880
how white people treat us is justified

281
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,160
because that they let us into the

282
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,600
country in the first place

283
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,360
which i think isn't right

284
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,800
on the santander i also think asian

285
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,320
mockery is very

286
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,720
deeply rooted in us like in our heads

287
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,480
where we justify it and we think it's

288
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,560
okay because we think it's funny

289
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,240
asians to each other we go ching chong

290
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,000
and stuff like that to each other

291
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,600
so for the most part when i heard a

292
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,160
white person initially before

293
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,760
say it i was okay with it it wasn't

294
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,600
until i had actually felt

295
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,519
bad about it then i realized it was

296
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,279
wrong

297
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:26,000
i i used to have somebody i used to know

298
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,519
their family was vietnamese but they

299
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,240
grew up in a white community

300
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,880
and for the most part i remember his

301
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,240
family

302
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,600
would tell me that they rejected or they

303
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,120
decided not to teach

304
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,600
their kids vietnamese because they think

305
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,000
they didn't need it and that

306
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,680
they tried i don't know in a way i can't

307
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,080
really say it because it's not my family

308
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,399
not

309
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,080
but to me it was like very they're

310
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,680
rejecting their own culture

311
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,360
and stuff like that and i realized in a

312
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,720
way it's deeply rooted that

313
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,720
some asian people reject their own

314
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,640
culture in order to fit in with this

315
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,040
country and how it is

316
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,720
and how people here discriminate so

317
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,320
heavily against asians leading to some

318
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,480
people rejecting their own culture

319
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,519
like i remember i told him or i told

320
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,320
this friend of mine

321
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,279
before he i told them oh chipman which

322
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,000
is um

323
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,800
vietnamese for happy new year and they

324
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,480
told me

325
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,000
please don't say that to me and i was

326
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,040
like why he's like

327
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,160
i don't like hearing it and i was like

328
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,440
okay but that's kind of odd but whatever

329
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,600
but for at the time i thought it was

330
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,720
just really odd how someone who was

331
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,399
vietnamese

332
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,160
doesn't like hearing their own language

333
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,640
and i kind of just realized slowly over

334
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,800
time

335
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,720
i see i've met other people exactly like

336
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,720
them

337
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,640
that reject their own cultural innocence

338
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,440
in order to fit in better with

339
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:46,160
white people and stuff like that and in

340
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,440
turn it makes me feel really sad because

341
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,959
it's very hard to live in a country

342
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,519
where

343
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,279
people are going to hate you just

344
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,160
because of the way you were born

345
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,360
something we can't change no matter how

346
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,640
whitewashed you are

347
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,240
no matter how much you try to act like a

348
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,800
white person or try to reject your

349
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,680
culture

350
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,240
in the end no matter what it's your it's

351
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,240
it's you

352
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,680
you're always going to be asian and even

353
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,000
if they try to deny it

354
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,519
it's just sad because either way in a

355
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,440
way we're never going to be accepted no

356
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,839
matter how hard we try

357
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,959
until they understand our point of view

358
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,040
because

359
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,040
change is extremely hard some people

360
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,560
have their own prejudices and it's just

361
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,480
sad to see that people have to reject

362
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:32,480
themselves to think that so they're

363
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:34,640
able to fit in with the

364
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,480
with how this country's built all the

365
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:40,399
systematic racism and how

366
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,279
it's trickled down to people in my age

367
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,839
and stuff like that

368
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:45,519
into denying their own culture which is

369
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,800
really upsetting

370
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,839
i also when i was this is actually most

371
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,320
recent i was

372
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,920
walking around the beach with my younger

373
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,360
brother and

374
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,440
you know we were walking with our dogs

375
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,360
and stuff like that and then

376
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,880
some white kid came up and this is

377
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,320
another example of how like

378
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,040
racism is somewhat normalized in

379
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:08,000
people's minds is or

380
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,800
how it in a way it's like it's just like

381
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,440
going off of the

382
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,240
last example of my friend or one of my

383
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,240
friends

384
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:18,399
or used to be my whatever but

385
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,399
he this white kid came up to us and he

386
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,320
was like oh can i pick your dog and he's

387
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,760
he was with two asian friends he had two

388
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,200
asian friends with him and it was just

389
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,800
one of this one little white kid

390
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,800
and he was like and we're like oh okay

392
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,519
and he pets the dog and then after that

393
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,320
he starts like grabbing its belly

394
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,440
and like grabbing her why did i call it

395
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,480
i'm so sorry

396
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,800
um i started grabbing cookies belly and

397
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,240
like

398
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,600
rubbing it and then feeling

399
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,639
her fat and stuff like that and me and

400
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,519
my brother were really uncomfortable and

401
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,760
he was like

402
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,360
wow you really find her up are you going

403
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,040
to eat her for a new year

404
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,279
and then me and my brother we looked at

405
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:58,639
each other and we're like

406
00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:00,000
what the and the two asian kids

407
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,480
with us were also looking at us and

408
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,880
we're like

409
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,880
and they're like

410
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,800
and i was like in my head i didn't i was

411
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,639
like

412
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,560
why aren't you saying something how are

413
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,560
you friends with this kid and then

414
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,240
they just didn't say anything and they

415
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,600
looked super uncomfortable and in a way

416
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,560
they kind of looked us in like i was

417
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,760
like we're sorry

418
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,000
but like they didn't say it but you

419
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,079
could tell they felt uncomfortable

420
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,440
with it too and the little white kid was

421
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:26,399
like laughing haha

422
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,399
and we all kind of just like

423
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,519
until after that and it just it's really

424
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,519
weird it's really gross how

425
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,040
in a way kids they can't stand up to

426
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,160
themselves because

427
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,560
white people have you know power in a

428
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,880
way

429
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,240
in this country and it's really sad to

430
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,720
see and hear that

431
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,519
the more i got older the more i realized

432
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,760
how

433
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,040
hard it is for asian people to get

434
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,160
certain opportunities

435
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,680
in life due to us being asian like

436
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,480
asians are kind of just categorized to

437
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,560
oh

438
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:01,040
doctors lawyers doctors lawyers of

439
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,120
pharmacists anything math related yada

440
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,920
yada and i'll admit

441
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,880
personally i do like to be an engineer i

442
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,680
do like math

443
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,959
of course of course i can like whatever

444
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,880
i want but

445
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:15,040
it's just weird how in a way it's all

446
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,639
every single asian is either

447
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,839
chopped up into that category it's okay

448
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,160
for them to go into that cairo but

449
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,399
anything else out of that spectrum

450
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,079
is for some reason 10 times more

451
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,920
difficult for any asian person to get

452
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,639
into

453
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,920
like for me i know i said i wanted to do

454
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,720
engineering but at the same time my true

455
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,160
passion does

456
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:37,120
rely in art film

457
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,160
animation and stuff like that but what

458
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,760
the other day i was having a

459
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:44,000
conversation with my mom and

460
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:46,959
she was like cameron

461
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,519
i'm sorry to say this to you but you're

462
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:51,120
asian

463
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:53,279
and even worse you're an asian girl

464
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,800
so do you think you're really going to

465
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,560
make it to hollywood without having to

466
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,199
get your hands dirty

467
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,880
and i was thinking to myself i was like

468
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:04,160
you know

469
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,760
she's right in a way that i can't do the

470
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,839
things i want to do because

471
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,880
i don't get the privileges that white

472
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,440
people get

473
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,000
because they are white i can't get the

474
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,079
automatic

475
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,760
respect that white people have because

476
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:21,440
i'm asian and worse yet an asian girl

477
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:23,040
and i can't prove to myself

478
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,639
or i can't prove to other people

479
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,560
specifically

480
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,320
my own worth without having to do

481
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,440
certain things in order to get that

482
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,680
approval

483
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,639
i have to work 10 times harder than most

484
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,399
other people

485
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:39,040
and it sucks it really sucks

486
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,000
because it sucks that i'm not going to

487
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,320
get the same opportunity

488
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,440
that white kids have because i'm asian

489
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,399
i'm not going to get the same

490
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,920
chances and even so even if i work so

491
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,720
hard

492
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,160
bias exists like if i if anything some

493
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,440
people will just choose the white person

494
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,320
automatically just because they're like

495
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,199
oh

496
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,600
they're white it's only after a couple

497
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,320
it's

498
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,160
even bts the number one best-selling

499
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,800
artist in the world right now

500
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,079
can't even get a grammy for best

501
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,600
performance

502
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,440
which no offense to lady gagarin and

503
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,720
granddaddy they're great but

504
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:15,199
bts wholly deserved that award

505
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,839
but you know hollywood in the music

506
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,880
industry

507
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:21,199
uses asians for clout they

508
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,720
throw in a couple little splurges of

509
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:25,519
diversity

510
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,639
diversity and then when they get all the

511
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,759
views and stuff

512
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:33,040
yank it out the weekend

513
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,040
bts um

514
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,720
khalid and stuff like that it wasn't

515
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,279
even until last year that

516
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,959
an asian movie won an oscar an

517
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:46,880
international movie won an oscar

518
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:48,480
parasite and it's opened the doors a lot

519
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,160
i won't say that there's been progress

520
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,199
but it's so

521
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,959
it's surprised it's off it's it's just

522
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,519
it's unbelievable that it's taken this

523
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,399
long

524
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,199
for anyone to get this to make a step

525
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,240
forward

526
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:05,039
and to change and to

527
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,520
diversify and for other things other

528
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,520
than

529
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,799
american hollywood made movies to win an

530
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,400
oscar

531
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,640
and even this year stephen yin got

532
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,640
nominated for his role in menari

533
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,079
and minari is an excellent film i highly

534
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,360
recommend it it does

535
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:21,679
also talk a lot about you know

536
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,039
raising kids in america when you're an

537
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,319
immigrant and stuff like that and i

538
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:27,360
really think it's a good

539
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:29,840
it's a good watch but

540
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,520
with all this stuff it's horrendous that

541
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,080
has taken this long

542
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,760
even crazy rich asians i think it was

543
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,520
like one of the first movies

544
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,240
in the past i don't know how long

545
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,799
hollywood's

546
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,799
been going on to have an all asian cast

547
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:47,440
and that was like

548
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:50,400
two three years ago and this year with

549
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:54,240
disney finally having one of their first

550
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:57,760
um animated asian

551
00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:01,600
uh properties since mulan

552
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:04,320
to get a live action movie i mean i like

553
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,919
an animated movie i mix that up with the

554
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,039
live action mulan and even the live

555
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,640
action mulan

556
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:14,000
technically isn't even culturally

557
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:18,400
or accurate to chinese culture

558
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:21,919
which is just it's disappointing

559
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:25,600
with a company as big and

560
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:27,520
has so many resources to make a decent

561
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,600
film just like a decent it didn't have

562
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,280
to be like

563
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,880
they could they have so many resources

564
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,200
they have so many things they could do

565
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,280
to

566
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,720
at least make it historically accurate

567
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:41,600
make it accurate

568
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:44,640
make it make sense but no all that money

569
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,799
all the money they have

570
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,039
that they made awful during the pandemic

571
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:52,880
and they can't even get

572
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:56,000
a certain set or a certain dress right

573
00:18:52,880 --> 00:19:00,080
it just blows my mind and it's

574
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:03,440
so it's so disheartening in a way for

575
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,000
asians to try and have dreams outside of

576
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,160
the

577
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,840
things that were already grouped into to

578
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,160
branch out and to

579
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,160
speak our name or and to speak anything

580
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,960
outside of that small bubble that we're

581
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,280
in

582
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,320
but that's just personally what i want

583
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,240
in a way

584
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,160
i want to do certain things but i know

585
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,840
for a fact as an asian

586
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,679
woman it's going to be extremely

587
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,520
difficult

588
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,679
there's also the thing of how asians

589
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,880
nowadays or asian girls are very

590
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,240
sexualized

591
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:36,000
i see how people talk about bts or just

592
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:39,360
k-pop idols in general

593
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,679
or how people or guys try to categorize

594
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,679
all

595
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:47,039
asian girls into like aha so kawaii

596
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:48,160
it's just so it's so disgusting in a way

597
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,600
that

598
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,080
we are just grouped into that just

599
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,960
because of our race which i've said that

600
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:57,919
a million times but it is it truly is

601
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,960
i see white girls trying to mimic asian

602
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:03,440
behaviors

603
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:05,919
asian fashion eat our food

604
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,720
try to use asian aesthetics hello kitty

605
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:08,720
rilakkuma

606
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,320
i don't know whatever they use to

607
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,080
make themselves like kawaii

608
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,080
and quirky or whatever whatever

609
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:17,039
that is and don't even

610
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,799
give a f behind they don't give a

611
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,000
they don't give a behind any of the

612
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,960
people behind that

613
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,600
they use it for an aesthetic and after

614
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,799
that they dip

615
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,280
they don't care about what's happening

616
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:31,039
to us for the most part i've seen many

617
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,520
white creators on instagram

618
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,799
on youtube who use asian aesthetics

619
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:38,080
asian

620
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:40,880
even guys who wear like japanese kanji

621
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,520
kanji katakana whatever shirts like that

622
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,559
and

623
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,760
they don't say anything they're just

624
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,760
like oh it looks cool

625
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,320
and it just it's just gross that you

626
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,080
just think our culture is just an

627
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,799
aesthetic for you to wear

628
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,640
to eat food enjoy yourselves but not

629
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:59,600
even care about the people behind it in

630
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,159
the meaning behind it

631
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,840
you use our stuff for your aesthetics

632
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,240
and to make yourself look better

633
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,440
only to then not even give when

634
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,240
something is actually happening to the

635
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,400
community behind it

636
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,159
it's disgusting to see things we were

637
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,799
originally mocked for our eyes our

638
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,720
slanted eyes our

639
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:21,760
our face just i don't know everything

640
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,080
about asians before that were mocked

641
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,280
you look on places like king tik tok i

642
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,880
hate tik tok i'm just going to say that

643
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,200
right i hate tik tok

644
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,080
you take stuff like that you go on to

645
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,280
sorry

646
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:36,159
you got the apps like tick tock and you

647
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,159
just see people be like

648
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:43,200
it's just so stupid like why you

649
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,760
like they'll go and use japanese sounds

650
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,400
japanese this japanese that or korean

651
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,000
stuff

652
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,520
and they just turn it into her own

653
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,440
little trend aesthetic and they're just

654
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,799
like oh my god this is so cute

655
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,640
and then once it's all over they're just

656
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:58,400
like okay

657
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:00,080
next because they just want to act

658
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,600
quirky or some like that and i just

659
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,159
think it's so stupid they make it a

660
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,039
trend

661
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,960
when originally if anybody or any asian

662
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:10,559
for that matter was into anime

663
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,720
kpop s j rock

664
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,240
stuff like that before we were all

665
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,039
mocked for it we were called

666
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,840
weird everything that asians used to do

667
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:21,280
were considered

668
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:23,360
weird creepy foreign

669
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,960
and now it's a trend for you all

670
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,919
to enjoy and be like oh my god this is

671
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,159
actually

672
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,960
so cute and then after that you don't

673
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,640
even give

674
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:34,080
behind the history behind that or just

675
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,400
anything like that you just use it for a

676
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,919
trend in which in a way

677
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,760
i know some people can make the argument

678
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,880
that oh we're grateful it's spreading

679
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,000
asian culture

680
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,280
but they don't even know what's behind

681
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,720
it they don't know

682
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,640
the meaning of it they don't know what

683
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,320
they're saying they don't even research

684
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,919
or do anything about it they just use it

685
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,520
for a trend because they see it they see

686
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,039
other people do it and they're like okay

687
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,559
i'll do it too

688
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:58,960
get the views get the likes and then

689
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,960
move on

690
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,799
and i'm sick and tired of it

691
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,039
if for me i see white creators using

692
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,520
drinking matcha

693
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,320
eating sushi buying hello kitty or

694
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,280
whatever

695
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,840
i at least want you to at least say that

696
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,080
say that

697
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,559
stop asian hate just even post a small

698
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,799
thing just a small thing

699
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,000
even i see the anime community in kpop

700
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,840
community right now they don't

701
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,280
say that much about it either which is

702
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,400
super disappointing for me because i'm

703
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,240
in both fandoms

704
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,520
i'm part of the anime community and kpop

705
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,039
community and it's so

706
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,320
disappointing to see that no one has

707
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:35,039
said anything

708
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,760
and it just makes me disappoint cause

709
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,520
like

710
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,799
the people that are behind the things

711
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,279
that you love and enjoy

712
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:42,799
are getting beat up on the street old

713
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,320
people just minding their own business

714
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:46,080
just walking around

715
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,919
just doing just living their life

716
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,279
they're just getting beat up for no

717
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,360
reason

718
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:54,480
for the sole purpose that they just for

719
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,480
our skin like

720
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:02,720
it's just it's sad that

721
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,720
our parents had to work so hard to get

722
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,200
into this country only for their kids to

723
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,600
suffer

724
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:12,480
the consequences of systematic racism

725
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,080
and for them to say that it is okay

726
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,159
because

727
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,159
we should be grateful that we're even

728
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,760
allowed here in the first place

729
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:22,799
i uh the other day i had an argument

730
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:26,080
with my mom and dad

731
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:27,520
about how they were like cameron you're

732
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,279
being too sensitive over this you're

733
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:32,080
playing the race card

734
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:34,080
you shouldn't you should be grateful but

735
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,039
you need to know that racism will always

736
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,000
be there

737
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:39,120
and that you can never change anything

738
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,360
and i'm like yeah

739
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,799
i get it i get that racism is always

740
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,520
going to be a thing it's never going to

741
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:45,520
completely

742
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,799
100 go away there's always going to be

743
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,520
some type of bias

744
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,559
or stereotype i understand that but it

745
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,279
doesn't hurt

746
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,480
to make change it doesn't hurt to say

747
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:57,200
something

748
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,960
staying silent is being complicit

749
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,320
staying silent about it is basically

750
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,960
saying

751
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,480
or just accepting that we deserve it is

752
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,960
not okay

753
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,159
and like i asked i was like i mean my

754
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,880
 father

755
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,279
he was like you know i was discriminated

756
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,960
against

757
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,159
by viet people i was like what does that

758
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,520
have to do with anything it's white

759
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,960
people discovering asian people and if

760
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,440
you're described by asian people that's

761
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,679
not

762
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,720
because you're do he's he's like he's

763
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,600
like but i'm beating me and i got to

764
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,440
scream my feet

765
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,440
i was like sure i was like yeah and

766
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,480
people it doesn't matter the whole

767
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:34,000
purpose of this whole

768
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:36,080
stop asian hate is so that asians

769
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,520
don't have to get beat up on the street

770
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,600
because of our race

771
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,640
if it's asians against asian then that's

772
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,720
a whole different

773
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,679
that's a whole different type of thing

774
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:49,039
that's a whole different type of thing

775
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:53,039
and it's just it's just

776
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:54,480
really sad it's really heartbreaking

777
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,799
the other day my younger brother came up

778
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,919
to me he's like like cameron

779
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:01,919
is it fair that because i'm asian

780
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,360
i'm never going to accomplish my dreams

781
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,919
of doing anything

782
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,679
because we were born this way and i told

783
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,679
him

784
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,840
i didn't know what to tell him i didn't

785
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:14,080
really know what to tell him

786
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,720
she was like cameron did we do anything

787
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:20,880
on our raw in our past lives to be born

788
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:24,080
in this body and i was like no ben

789
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,600
we didn't do anything wrong we were born

790
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,720
this way

791
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,880
and that's how it is then so be it we

792
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:35,039
have to stay strong we have to

793
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:37,919
stay hold face in this in this time of

794
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:39,840
hate and stuff like that especially with

795
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:42,000
kobit and things getting worse

796
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,279
i think it's really important that we

797
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,400
have to stay strong

798
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:48,640
and i really love that

799
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,320
our community has gotten a lot stronger

800
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,840
because we all been able to stay

801
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,840
together during this entire experience

802
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,159
and really hold our own together and

803
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,640
stay strong

804
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,840
as a community and it's really good to

805
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,600
see that but

806
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,960
hearing my brother saying that he

807
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,120
doesn't think he can ever accomplish a

808
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,960
dream because he's not white makes me

809
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:11,919
really disappointed

810
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,279
because sometimes i believe that too

811
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:15,360
that i won't be able to accomplish

812
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,400
anything i want to do because i am not

813
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,399
white either

814
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,480
there are times where i think most asian

815
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:22,159
kids can agree with this that we were

816
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,840
born

817
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,360
or we were sometimes wish we were born

818
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,200
white

819
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,960
or like a white male so that you know we

820
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,919
could just go somewhere and cheat up the

821
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,279
place and then

822
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:35,520
you know get away with it because we

823
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:38,720
just had a bad day you know

824
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,720
you know it's just yeah

825
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:43,039
it's just not really that fair

826
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,080
i just it's just heartbreaking to see

827
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:52,880
old people minding their own business

828
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:55,039
almost get their life taken away

829
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,799
or seeing people do get their life taken

830
00:27:55,039 --> 00:28:00,799
away just because

831
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:04,080
of racism and stereotypes

832
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:06,960
or stuff like that and

833
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,320
just or see people just use our culture

834
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,240
for their aesthetics

835
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,600
only to not care about the people behind

836
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,320
it and

837
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:16,080
as an asian person myself it's just

838
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,080
really heartbreaking to see that because

839
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,399
i wish that

840
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,080
you know things were different i wish

841
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:26,880
things would have to be this way but

842
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,880
that's how it is and yeah

843
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,159
i don't really know how to end this i

844
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,039
just

845
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:34,720
it's just very disappointing it's really

846
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:36,640
disappointing

847
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,559
i really hope that there's one day going

848
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,960
to be changed

849
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:42,000
there are there's change happening now

850
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,960
but

851
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,480
is it enough i really hope that people

852
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,520
will be able to come to understanding

853
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,360
that

854
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:53,760
we never did anything i

855
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,640
most asian people aren't doing anything

856
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,559
wrong

857
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,320
most of us are just living our lives

858
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:02,240
trying to make ends meet

859
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:06,000
trying to just enjoy each other have fun

860
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:07,600
we're just like you everybody's the same

861
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,520
everybody wants to have fun everybody

862
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,640
wants to be loved everybody wants to be

863
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,840
accepted

864
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,840
and we are no different

865
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:21,840
i just hope that because of all this

866
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:25,360
that there will be things put in place

867
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:27,840
and that the victims of asian hate

868
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:30,000
will get the justice they all deserve

869
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,880
because i am proud to be vietnamese

870
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,799
i am proud that i am asian even in times

871
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,440
where i wish i wasn't

00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:38,320
in the end i am proud of our culture i

873
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,360
