21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,920
it's easy to do different hairstyles

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,920
like today tied it up

23
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,360
however i kind of want to add long

24
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,239
layers so i have more

25
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,440
of a bounce and more personality in my

26
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,039

but i love it so far another thing i've

30
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,760
been loving is what i'm wearing right

31
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,480
now

32
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,000
this is a new loungewear from third love

33
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,760
if you guys follow me on instagram then

34
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,520
you know that your girl is in love with

35
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,400
third love third love has a really

36
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,240
comfortable

37
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,520
underwear bras and now they just came

38
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,000
out with loungewear which

39
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,640
i'm very very very obsessed they sent

40
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,720
over this

41
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,479
i'm wearing the set right now and it's

42
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,119
so so freaking cute

43
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,520
but isn't this so cute we have this top

44
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,040
here

45
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,479
i'm gonna wear this or try it on a

46
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,280
little bit later i haven't tried this

47
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,840
one on yet

48
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,400
but look at these shorts that go with it

49
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,720
we

50
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,759
love comfortable loungewear because we

51
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,759
are homebodies and

52
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,200
that's what we're all about this is like

53
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,759
nothing new i've been

54
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,159
literally obsessed with this and

55
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,759
honestly i've been using it more before

56
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,360
makeup because i feel like it sits

57
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,720
really nicely

58
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,479
on uh underneath makeup for my skin care

59
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,079
if you guys watch my vlogs then you know

60
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,040
like i've been using something different

61
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,640
for skin care

62
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,320

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,519
video because

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,480
today's video is in partnership with

85
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,080
third love

86
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,760
which if you guys have been following me

87
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,920
on instagram then

88
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:46,080
you know you know i've been loving third

89
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,760
love and i'm so grateful to be working

90
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,519
with them because let me tell you

91
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,200
i mentioned them in a previous vlog by

92
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,680
the way so some of you might already

93
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,599
know

94
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,040
third love is a place that you can go

95
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:58,560
and get really

96
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,480
good quality comfortable bras underwear

97
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,760
and now they have loungewear which is

98
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,200
really exciting but

99
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,800
i hate brawls i'm gonna be honest with

100
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,640
you i hate brows and

101
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,879
whenever i do wear a bra it has to be

102
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,120
extremely comfortable i'm all about

103
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,959
support i'm all about comfort and i'm

104
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,040
all about coverage and i'm all about

105
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,800
quality because bras are very expensive

106
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,720
these days and you want to invest in one

107
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,120
that's going to last you for a very long

108
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,480
time

109
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,239
and something that makes you happy

110
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,599
something that makes you want to wear it

111
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,360
something that feels like you're not

112
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,319
wearing a bra and that's exactly what

113
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,400
third love is

114
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,400
they are probably one of the best bras

115
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,720
that i've ever had and i love them

116
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,760
dearly if you are somebody like me who's

117
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,680
looking for a good bra

118
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,760
third love is the way to go i want to

119
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,480
show you guys my bra that i'm wearing

120
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,080
right now

121
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,159
um first of all this loungewear from

122
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,720
them is so cute i love this color

123
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:47,200
but you guys look at this bra so i

124
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,560
shared this in a previous video but

125
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,120
i think this is so funny let me just

126
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,080
take this off can we just admire

127
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,200
how cute this bra is so what i love

128
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,920
about it first of all

129
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,920
is the coverage i love love love the

130
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,560
coverage i love the support for the

131
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,879
girls

132
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,799
and it's high quality you can see the

133
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,560
wires right here for the support but

134
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,080
these are not going to poke through in a

135
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,640
few years because this is really high

136
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,200
quality

137
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,120
i definitely had other ones before where

138
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,680
i didn't really invest in them or they

139
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,400
weren't

140
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,680
made well and eventually the wires here

141
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,519
would poke through

142
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,519
and then bruise like the middle of my

143
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,960
chest here leave me a comment

144
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,720
and let me know if you've had one of

145
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,040
those third love doesn't do that

146
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,160
they have really really really high

147
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,320
quality bras

148
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,400
i also love how comfortable the straps

149
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,880
are they just sit really nicely

150
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,520
in on my skin they're not like in my

151
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,440
skin

152
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,040
where they're causing prints or making

153
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,120
me feel uncomfortable

154
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,120
i also love the double layer for this

155
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,919
design so we have the bottom here and

156
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,639
then we have

157
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,440
this comfortable uh see-through material

158
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,199
on top

159
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,720
this is definitely the one bra that i

160
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,120
would recommend to you guys

161
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,120
you can wear this under a t-shirt you

162
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,320
can wear it under a nice blouse it's

163
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,400
very versatile

164
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,759
it's good to have in your closet one of

165
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,479
the main things

166
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,680
that makes me love third love so much is

167
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,759
just go on their website

168
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,600
you'll see it i love their website

169
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,240
because every time i go on it i feel

170
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,479
like

171
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,440
i'm able to wear those things and it's

172
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,360
all about

173
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,560
different shapes and different sizes

174
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,600
it's for everybody

175
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,600
it's diversity and it makes me feel like

176
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,880
i'm a part of something that's super

177
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,840
powerful and

178
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,039
i feel like i can be myself and i love

179
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,120
third love because

180
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,320
i said this in a previous vlog but in

181
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,680
2018

182
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,759
and 2019 i gained a lot of weight

183
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,720
and i was going through a lot of

184
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,039
self-conscious

185
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,840
so it's really hard for me to talk right

186
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,720
now about this in 2018 and 2019 i gained

187
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,960
a lot of weight

188
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,240
and i was very self-conscious about my

189
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,880
body and

190
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,199
i was very uncomfortable my own skin i

191
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,400
would photoshop my instagram photos

192
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,680
i hated looking at myself on camera and

193
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,080
i feel like that's a big part of

194
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,840
also why i didn't vlog as much because

195
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,560
not only do you notice the gateway in

196
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,039
yourself

197
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,280
but then you're on the internet and the

198
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,759
internet sometimes can be such a crappy

199
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,160
place

200
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,160
and you're reminded all the time how

201
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,600
much weight you've gained or how fat you

202
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,080
are or how ugly you are

203
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,199
and it starts affecting your mental

204
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,800
health and

205
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,199
that's also part of the reason like i

206
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,840
said why i just hated looking at myself

207
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,639
on screen

208
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,960
and i would have to tell you third love

209
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,440
reached out to me at the end of 2018

210
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,319
and it was kind of just like this new

211
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,360
chapter

212
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,319
i felt like you know what i love the

213
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,360
body that i am

214
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,000
in and i'm so happy like why am i

215
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,560
letting

216
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,319
other people's opinion of me affect me i

217
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,280
can't control that the only thing that i

218
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,360
can control

219
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,600
is how i react to things and that's been

220
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,400
something that has really helped me get

221
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,120
through

222
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,319
finding myself again and loving my body

223
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,319
and so

224
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,080
whenever i go on the third love website

225
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,039
i guess it's kind of nostalgic

226
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,360
it brings me back to that time of when

227
00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:00,560
truly everything started to change

228
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:03,039
like it's okay to

229
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,800
not look like others like don't compare

230
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,880
yourself to others like it's okay

231
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,000
like this is flappy like flappy wacky

232
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,800
right here like it's just

233
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,400
okay to be yourself like i like who

234
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,960
cares like i have

235
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,080
a stomach like i have a waist but look i

236
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,720
also have a stomach

237
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,960
like this is belly jelly right here it's

238
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,639
okay to be yourself and i feel like

239
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,400
it has felt so good in 20

240
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,560
sorry i'm gonna get emotional like it

241
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:32,639
has felt so good in 20

242
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,800
20 21 to like feel myself and be myself

243
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,039
and i wish that i could go back and like

244
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,280
tell that girl in 2018 that

245
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,360
it's okay to love your body and it's

246
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,960
okay to not look like everybody else

247
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,639
that you see on the internet

248
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,319
i i just like i want to put this out

249
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,199
there because i want to set an example

250
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,800
for

251
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,479
young girls and young boys that are

252
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,000
watching out there because i feel like

253
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:57,199
the generation under ours is just so

254
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
social media obsessed which is a bad and

255
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,080
good thing

256
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,240
and having being someone with an

257
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:06,160
influence and having a platform i

258
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:09,440
want them to know that you are beautiful

259
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,440
and you do whatever makes you happy and

260
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,479
you don't need to look a certain way or

261
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,800
act a certain way

262
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,599
all you have to be is unapologetically

263
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,800
yourself

264
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,520
and it's it's it's taken a very long

265
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,720
time

266
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,879
for me to get to where i am i feel like

267
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,240
i am entering that chapter like i'm

268
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,080
turning 28 this year

269
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,759
and for the first time in my life i

270
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,279
truly can say like

271
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:35,039
i just don't care what other people

272
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,640
think of me like i know who i

273
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:42,080
am i finally realize my truth

274
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,800
and i love me i love my body for the way

275
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,880
it is and

276
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,000
if one day i want to change something

277
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,240
about myself

278
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,600
like i will choose to because it's my

279
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,640
body and i tried so hard for so long

280
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,560
to change people's opinions about me

281
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,320
and it's like that's their opinion you

282
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,880
know i feel like

283
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,080
people are like mirrors whatever they

284
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,120
reflect

285
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:07,519
is what they're feeling on the inside so

286
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,040
all of these mean comments and all these

287
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,120
super awful cruel

288
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,440
vicious people on the internet i hope

289
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,959
they're okay and that's all that i can

290
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,640
that's all that you can do because you

291
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,760
can't control other people but like i

292
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,399
said you can control

293
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,040
how you react to things and how you feel

294
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,519
and

295
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,320
i've taken some time to work on myself

296
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,600
and

297
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,839
to love my body again and

298
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,519
she's here and she's here to stay and

299
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,959
she's got flappy this is flappy wappy

300
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,640
it's definitely still been a journey

301
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,360
there are some days when i'm just like

302
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,200
you know

303
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,279
we're not feeling ourselves today and

304
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,680
then some some days i'm just like i'm

305
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,080
fine

306
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,160
so nothing's perfect no one's perfect

307
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,640
there are on and off days you know

308
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,800
anyways i just felt like that was the

309
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,399
right time to express that and

310
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,839
i hope you guys know where i'm coming

311
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,080

look at how stretchy everything is

340
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:55,839
and how high quality everything is we

341
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,800

342
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,320
this is really pretty and then we also

343
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,760

344
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,160

this is a close favorite of mine i love

348
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,800
this this would probably be in second

349
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,680
place

350
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,160
i just love how beautiful the designs

351
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,839
are

352
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,440
but they still make it comfortable like

353
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,680
you shouldn't have to choose

354
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,480
between comfort and having a cute-ass

355
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,160
bra you know

356
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,560
like you can have both and that's what i

357
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,560
think it is like i just love everything

358
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,120
about this one this one i've warned

359
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,880
like 10 times already like i love this i

360
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,000
love the color as well they have great

361
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,120
color selections

362
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,600
and i love that this section here

363
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,360
doesn't go super tight on the side of my

364
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,000
uh body because then i have like extra

365
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,880
fat bulging

366
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,160
out i just love this and then we also

367
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,079
have a strapless

368
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,839
bra i'm always down for this sometimes

369
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,680
you wear dresses that require a

370
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,200
strapless bra and then what i love about

371
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,920
the strapless bra here is

372
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,279
they have this kind of texture material

373
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,240
here so it's not

374
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,959
going to move when you guys wear it if

375
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,440
you guys are

376
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,880
unsure of your size they have this

377
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,680
feature on the website called the

378
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,920
fitting room

379
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,079
and you can go on and take a very

380
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,639
detailed test and find out your perfect

381
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,720
size

382
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,959
and don't worry if a bra doesn't fit

383
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,959
they have a 60 day guaranteed so you can

384
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,639
send it back and they'll gladly take it

385
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:21,760
also if you guys are looking for

386
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:23,920
half cup sizes third love also has that

387
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,160
most brands have like 30 sizes i believe

388
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,519
third love has 80. so they definitely

389
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,440
have a variety you guys should check

390
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,160
them out i do have a discount code it's

391
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,639
kim tai

392
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,160
and that takes 20 off your first order

393
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,440
but i think i should like start putting

394
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,760
makeup on because

395
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,800
my primer already probably has dried

396
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,880
into my skin

397
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,000
i'm using this foundation today and i'm

398
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:46,240
honestly

399
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,680
so excited so i was doing my foundation

400
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,519
and i realized that we were not

401
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,880
recording so that's

402
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,399
great we love that so what we don't love

403
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,240
is this foundation

404
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,720
i'm going to be returning this this is

405
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,880
the morphe filter light 8 foundation

406
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,920
yeah not my favorite it's not really

407
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,560
looking good on

408
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,959
my skin and i don't know if maybe it's

409
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,720
not

410
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:11,360
compatible with a brush but i don't know

411
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,000
i just don't think it's good for dry

412
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,040
skin

413
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
because my skin is dry right now not too

414
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,160
sure about this one

415
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,839
i'm just gonna like blend this in and

416
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,839
just like hope that a miracle happens

417
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,600
also with natural lighting i feel like

418
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,040
it's in and out in and out sometimes i'm

419
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,560
going to be brighter and sometimes i'm

420
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,279
going to be a little bit on the darker

421
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,600
side

422
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,120
so i do apologize we're using natural

423
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,880
lighting which personally i love because

424
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,600
i feel like you guys can really see the

425
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,240
products

426
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,360
and it just feels more casual like i

427
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,839
feel like we're really hanging out you

428
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,560
know

429
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:47,279
honestly i'm very very very sad about

430
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:51,279
that foundation i really wanted it to

431
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:54,880
to work but it's okay

432
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,880

wearing a full face of makeup

438
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,160
we love a light bronzer

439
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,199
i was like honestly sitting here talking

440
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,079
to

441
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:30,320
my best friend brooke the other day and

442
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,880
i was just telling her i was like i feel

443
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,120
like

444
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,480
people should just stop commenting on

445
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,839
other people's bodies and i'm not

446
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,279
talking about like commenting on

447
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,120
instagram or like youtube

448
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,639
i feel like just commenting on other

449
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,160
people's bodies in general

450
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,519
because you feel you like don't know i'm

451
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,440
honestly just ranting right now because

452
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,199
i feel like we're just hanging out and

453
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,720
and doing makeup together but what i was

454
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,800
saying is like i feel like you just

455
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,959
don't know what people are going through

456
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,279
like you just don't you don't know if

457
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:59,360
someone's like low-key

458
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,120
not feeling their body in some way i

459
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,040
know when i was

460
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,440
gaining weight i was going through a lot

461
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,440
of like mental things in my head

462
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,040
and it was really hard you know i don't

463
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,720
know if you guys can relate i definitely

464
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,600
have said this before and i feel like a

465
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,839
lot of people

466
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,959
have said oh my god that's like the same

467
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,959
thing in my culture

468
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,240
i feel like in the asian culture they

469
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,639
like have no filter

470
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,600
like growing up even when i was like at

471
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,160
my skinniest

472
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,079
i would have like aunts and cousins come

473
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,560
to parties and be like oh

474
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:31,199
like you look like you gained some

475
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,440
weight or oh my god like they would like

476
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,320
pinch your arm or whatever not like in a

477
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,880
vicious way

478
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,120
it's kind of like a teasing way but that

479
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:42,320
really effs up someone's mental health

480
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,920
like growing up i was like 115 pounds

481
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,079
120 pounds

482
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,360
and whenever i looked in the mirror i

483
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,920
was like i feel fine

484
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,040
i look fine i would always oh my god i

485
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,079
would always google

486
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:56,160
like what is that thing called be bmi

487
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,079
i think it's like body mass index or

488
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,199
something and if you type in your weight

489
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,120
and your height

490
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,720
if you're over a certain number you're

491
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,600
like consider

492
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,320
like under medical terms like overweight

493
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,800
and then

494
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,160
if you're in between a certain spectrum

495
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,759
you're considered

496
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,199
normal or something like that something

497
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,959
like that i don't know i learned it

498
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,959
i think in health class but i would like

499
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,560
always like this is so bad i would

500
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:21,680
always type in my weight

501
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,600
and my height and it would say normal

502
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,600
but then i would see like these

503
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,920
relatives and they would be like oh you

504
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,120
look

505
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,440
fat and that mentally really destroyed

506
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,480
me

507
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,600
and then as the years like as the years

508
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,560
went on

509
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,000
when i was gaining weight it just got

510
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,440
worse and worse it's like hey

511
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,120
like you know you're gaining weight like

512
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,560
maybe you know and it's like

513
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,800
i know that like when it comes to family

514
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:49,360
in the in like the vietnamese culture

515
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,000
it's not coming from like a bullying

516
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,000
aspect

517
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,199
it's coming from like a good place i

518
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,320
don't know how to explain it it's like

519
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,240
really hard to explain

520
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,040
body image issues in the vietnamese

521
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,720
culture it's it's super hard to explain

522
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,000
it i don't even know where to start

523
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,160
because i don't want you guys to think

524
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,160
that like my family is super mean to me

525
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,679
that's not the case i love my family and

526
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,360
they love me so much but

527
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,199
that's like the one thing i would change

528
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,720
and i always tell carlos this i'm like

529
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,640
when we have kids

530
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,799
like i don't care if it's a boy or a

531
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,720
girl like that [ __ ] is not gonna fly

532
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,319
with me like i don't want any of that

533
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,160
unnecessary comments

534
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,760
not saying that i want my child to grow

535
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,640
up thinking he or she is completely

536
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,120
perfect

537
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,720
that's not the case the case is i don't

538
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,799
want my child growing up

539
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,720
thinking that they need to look a

540
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,919
certain way or need to be at a certain

541
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,039
weight or they're not considered

542
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,760
beautiful if they're

543
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,799
in this weight uh range or that weight

544
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,240
range you know

545
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,600
i don't know it's just like i feel like

546
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,679
we should just stop commenting on

547
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,880
people's bodies in general because

548
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:49,360
someone could yeah be losing weight or

549
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,960
for example like someone could be skinny

550
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,840
or in your eyes skinny and you can be

551
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,080
like oh like

552
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,840
you look like you lost some weight or

553
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,600
and they didn't do anything new and they

554
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,720
could be like oh like was i fat

555
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,080
like it it it makes people especially

556
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,720
people that already have

557
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,120
self-image issues like i did like it it

558
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,039
like

559
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,320
[ __ ] with you like it messes with your

560
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,200
head i just feel like we should just

561
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,039
stop in general

562
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,960
i don't know it's just and i feel like

563
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,440
social media doesn't help because i feel

564
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,280
like

565
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:19,039
in 2017 when i was really really really

566
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,760
indulged in social media

567
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:23,919
i wanted so badly to look like the girls

568
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,919
that i saw online and the only way to do

569
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,679
that was obviously to photoshop

570
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,520
like i have to facetune the [ __ ] out of

571
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,720
my body i wanted to look like those

572
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,480
girls i

573
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:37,360
in my mind in 2017 was like if i

574
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,520
look like them i'll get more likes i'll

575
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,320
be more likable people will like me

576
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,600
and it's just so unhealthy like so

577
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,760
freaking unhealthy

578
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,000
and it took a very long time for me to

579
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,160
realize that it took me a long time

580
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,200
to finally this year sit down and be

581
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,320
like

582
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,320

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,799
jelly you know i just we're

584
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,160
all so beautiful in our own ways and

585
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,240
sometimes it takes

586
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,640
everybody like a different amount of

587
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,039
time to realize it but once you get

588
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,720
there

589
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,559
and once you realize how [ __ ]

590
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,799
beautiful you are it's like the

591
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,400
best feeling ever like i honestly have

592
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,600
gotten to the point in my life where i

593
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,280
just don't care

594
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,120
like i just do not care what people

ugh this is like the downfall of filming

652
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,000
with natural lighting it's like

653
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,679
the lighting is not consistent like it

654
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,559
was just kind of dark and now it's super

655
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,880
bright out

656
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,840

657
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,360
little bit better

but the internet can be such a shitty

662
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,000
place and

663
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,440
that's coming from somebody that does

664
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,840
social media for a living

665
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,960

super insane how crazy people can be

i also think it's just so wild

669
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,480
that people can be so mean behind a

670
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,600
keyboard like i

671
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:01,600
i just i i can't do it like but

672
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:04,799
however i must admit at one point

673
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:08,640
i was that troll though at one point

674
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:11,919
when i was 18 i hated my life

675
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,679

676
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,320
i don't use this word lightly i was

677
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,320
depressed

678
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,760
when i was 18 i hated my life i was

679
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,640

680
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,120
major self-image issues was going

681
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,480
through

682
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,919
a really rough mental state no one knew

683
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,840

684
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,679
vietnamese household ain't nobody got

685
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,039
time for mental health and it's the

686
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,799

688
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:37,679
because i'm so excited

689
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:40,159
to focus on things that were not focused

690
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,880
for me growing up and i feel like i had

691
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,640
to learn

692
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,480

the things that they do online because i

once was there like i

727
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,320
once was a reflection of what i was

728
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,200
feeling

729
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:59,039
like i released negative energy and

730
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,159
that's all that i got in return and it

731
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,480
wasn't until

732
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,360
i reached a point where i was like okay

733
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,200
hold up

734
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,960

00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,720
things and i need to change that around

736
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,640
