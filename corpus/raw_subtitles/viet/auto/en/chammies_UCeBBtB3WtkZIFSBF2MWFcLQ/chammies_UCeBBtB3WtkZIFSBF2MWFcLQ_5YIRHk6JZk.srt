[Music]

2
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:19,500
hey everyone so it's may and may is

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,300
Asian American Pacific Islander Heritage

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,820
Month so I thought it'd be the perfect

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,170
time to do the Asian American tag so

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,390
this tag actually started circulating

7
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,609
about two years ago I think I saw on my

8
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,779
favorite bloggers gen him do it I know

9
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:32,070
well she'd take a bunch of her other

10
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:33,329
friends like wheelie and then I would

11
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,010
step on line and there's just a bunch of

12
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:36,960
people doing the Asian American tag on

13
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,570
YouTube so I thought it would be great

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,059
to upload my own version of it let's get

15
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,940
started all right so the first question

16
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:47,070
is what ethnicity are you so I am

17
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,510
Vietnamese although I can't be 100% sure

18
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,969
as you see in the title I'm actually

19
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:53,399
adopted so we don't really know if I'm

20
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:55,289
100% Vietnamese although when I do walk

21
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,489
into the nail salons and a lot of them

22
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:58,109
are owned by baiting these people here

23
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:59,699
in Portland people are like start

24
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:00,899
speaking to me Vietnamese I'm like okay

25
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:03,629
I guess that means that probably looks

26
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:05,129
somewhat Vietnamese I know my older

27
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:07,080
sister who was a doctor from bottom well

28
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,360
she actually wants to do like the gene

29
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,820
test with me so we can see like exactly

30
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,340
what if miss news we are so I may look

31
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,979
into that in the future question 2 is

32
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,990
what generation are you as I said

33
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:20,640
earlier I'm adopted so I'm not really

34
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,680
sure I don't really think that counts as

35
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,920
a generation I guess if anything would

36
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:29,490
be one kind of I didn't like come over

37
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,920
here on choice because that sounds weird

38
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:34,350
but yeah that's me

39
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,570
the third question is what is the first

40
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,490
experience where you felt the

41
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,890
demarcation of being a minority or

42
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,600
different and I always knew that I was

43
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,220
different when I was in elementary

44
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,689
school and before that my parents would

45
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,670
I say hey like just so you know you're

46
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:50,549
adopted we didn't come out of our body

47
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,020
we went to Vietnam and got you and they

48
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:53,340
would say like oh you're Asian Americans

49
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,780
they might like a little different and

50
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,850
so in elementary school I just thought

51
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,340
like okay if you have black hair then

52
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,840
that means your agent like me I didn't

53
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,920
really think too much about it but then

54
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,750
when I got to middle schools when I

55
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,820
really started to see oh wait I think

56
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,079
I'm really different like it was easy

57
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,489
for me to tell that I was different

58
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:10,110
because it was female that was pretty

59
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:11,060
easy for me to pick up on but in terms

60
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,530
of Asian American I

61
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,930
notice too much but how come you

62
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:15,980
asian-americans at my school and then as

63
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,989
I said when I got to middle school

64
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:21,170
actually that's when kids started coming

65
00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:25,010
up and being like hey where you might be

66
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:28,459
like Portland like no were you really

67
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:29,780
friend I'm like oh I guess Vietnam also

68
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:32,269
she wanted to know and then they would

69
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:34,430
say things like oh you don't really look

70
00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:36,769
Asian and you must be half white or

71
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:38,300
something so I realized on my way

72
00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:41,150
friends didn't get asked that so I was

73
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:43,489
like well okay I guess I'm different I

74
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:45,739
guess I'm Asian American per share and

75
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:47,209
people can definitely tell this and it

76
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:48,920
was very interesting and then terms of

77
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:50,989
being adopted in middle schools also

78
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,160
when I realized it was really for me it

79
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:53,330
just seemed normal as well I actually

80
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,400
have a couple of friends that were

81
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:57,019
adopted to from Asia something okay like

82
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,090
people are adopted it's like no

83
00:02:57,019 --> 00:03:00,319
different from not being adopted but

84
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:02,120
then when I got to middle school I

85
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,370
actually had this response from some guy

86
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,890
I said oh I'm adopted and then he said

87
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:10,640
oh that's sucks and I was just so thrown

88
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:12,140
off I know to say I was like I mean me

89
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,819
and then he felt really bad I apologize

90
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:16,340
profusely but it was just weird that

91
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:17,720
that was his gut reaction and so and

92
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:19,070
I've encountered that later on as well

93
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,019
where people were like have this idea

94
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:22,579
that like adopted and foster kids or

95
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:24,290
like messed up or something I there's

96
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:25,730
something wrong with them because they

97
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:28,010
didn't like come out of their mom so

98
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:29,450
that's me kind of weird and then also I

99
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:30,380
realize when I told this one girl miss

100
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,880
what I was adopted

101
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,440
it wasn't bad but she was just like oh

102
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,209
what's that like is it really different

103
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,790
at your house like what do you guys do

104
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:40,430
and I was just like uh that's pretty

105
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:42,650
much the same we dinner me watch TV you

106
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:44,480
play video games not really too

107
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,620
different it's pretty much the same I

108
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,609
don't feel any different these are my

109
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,530
parents parents

110
00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:50,269
so yeah middle school is really when I

111
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:51,489
started to realize wow I guess I'm

112
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:54,319
pretty different in those perspectives

113
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:56,389
hmm and then the fourth question is was

114
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,319
there a time when you weren't proud of

115
00:03:56,389 --> 00:03:59,269
your heritage

116
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:00,980
and I would say yes there definitely was

117
00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:02,630
I think in middle school weekend that's

118
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:05,299
where you do let's the grill the puberty

119
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:07,370
all that pens dead so in middle school I

120
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:08,870
wasn't what say I wasn't like ashamed of

121
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:10,280
it I wasn't like oh yo in Vietnamese I

122
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,930
want nothing to associate with it I just

123
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,760
want to say I proved all Americans I

124
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:15,769
don't really see business to the same

125
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,959
thing and everyone in the media who I

126
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:20,750
saw as like Asian American was really

127
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:23,030
nerdy or really awkward or like a dweeb

128
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:25,340
and nobody like it was

129
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,720
desirable to be asian-american except

130
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,520
like you know I guess brenda song I

131
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,440
really liked her but there wasn't much

132
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,760
for us so I was kind of like I just

133
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,380
don't really talk about it I wasn't

134
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,180
super gun calm I'm Asian American I'm

135
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:38,900
Vietnamese yeah like I learned all about

136
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:41,780
it so I wasn't really like big on being

137
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:43,250
proud of my heritage back then which is

138
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,480
kind of sad because I think like

139
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,220
everyone should be proud of who they are

140
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,750
and their identity but I just didn't

141
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:50,480
really see that as a big part of mine at

142
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:52,430
the time the fifth question is what type

143
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,990
of stereotypes do you deal with and I

144
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:56,690
would say there were a lot definitely I

145
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:57,910
think in middle school a lot of the

146
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:02,230
stereotypes were more like

147
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:02,230
microaggressions which definitions

148
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:08,840
basically what happened in middle school

149
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:11,240
is I had a lot of kids say things like

150
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,370
oh I remember this one girls like wow

151
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:17,960
like you're really pretty for an asian

152
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:19,790
girl I was just like okay I'm not to do

153
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,590
with that again I'm pretty sure that's

154
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:23,389
just like one stereotype that there's

155
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:26,660
like this white ideal beauty and the

156
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:30,800
Asians like can't reach that so that was

157
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:36,010
really and then I also had a lot of

158
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:38,720
people say wow just because you're like

159
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:40,669
oh you're so good at school I got the

160
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,680
Asian genes and like you know people

161
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:43,910
might think well Johnny I realize it's

162
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,650
like it's a college people wouldn't

163
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,450
think I was it's a positive stereotype

164
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:49,220
like that's fine but it's really not

165
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:50,330
because you're saying oh I'm not smart

166
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:52,910
because I worked hard

167
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:55,640
you say I'm smart because I happened to

168
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:57,470
be Asian so those are hurtful as well

169
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:59,660
and then getting older as I can't go to

170
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:01,039
college and I'm like now I think the

171
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,350
biggest one I have to deal with is a

172
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,890
fascination of Asian women which is the

173
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:08,419
idea

174
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:15,080
Oh American woman like doing it a lot

175
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:16,400
they serve a great like my eyes and it's

176
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,410
just really weird and I was like oh I

177
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,030
love Asian girls are the best all like

178
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:21,919
again the chickadee you just want to do

179
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:24,710
it a lot because you're Asian good Asian

180
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:27,080
girls love doing yeah that's what I'm

181
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:29,120
sure I mean I know there are girls of

182
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,729
all races that love doing it it's on the

183
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,979
don't and has nothing to do with race

184
00:06:31,729 --> 00:06:37,160
and the really fine line between

185
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:38,990
fetishization so

186
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,540
it's hard to deal with us I see what you

187
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:44,240
tend to date and stuff so another

188
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:46,430
stereotype dealing with right now Chris

189
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,950
with the coma 19 going on as a lot of

190
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:52,130
people think that it's like the Chinese

191
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:53,930
virus and that that Koba 19 was started

192
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:55,700
by any East Asian American looking

193
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:57,140
people and so recently as you've

194
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,790
probably seen there's been a lot of

195
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:01,280
violence and hatred and hate crimes

196
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:02,360
against Asian Americans so that's

197
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,950
something I'm doing this right now I

198
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,770
feel lucky that so far I haven't had

199
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:09,590
anything happen yet but it is weird to

200
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:11,150
have your mom say like hey please be

201
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:13,280
careful when you both side like try to

202
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:16,070
like that will definitely wear a mask

203
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,720
and I'm like what kind of come your face

204
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:19,880
like don't like of Asian American

205
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,500
because people are gonna like might beat

206
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,510
you up and literally kill you for that

207
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,700
so that's pretty scary and it's

208
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,960
something that's just this big

209
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:30,380
stereotype that we're dealing with right

210
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,630
now and just clarify for everybody the

211
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:34,550
virus is not the Chinese virus and just

212
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:37,400
because you look East Asian American

213
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:42,530
does not mean you have it please stop

214
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:44,720
being racist please and question six is

215
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:46,610
can you speak the language unfortunately

216
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,320
I cannot speak Vietnamese I wish I could

217
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:50,900
I did try speaking Vietnamese like

218
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,790
YouTube video tutorials / like a solid

219
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,980
week I think this is so hard I kind of

220
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:56,420
just gave up and if I school had offered

221
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:58,640
it I definitely will take it in in high

222
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:00,860
school but an our middle school and high

223
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:04,220
school I only offered French Mandarin

224
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,430
and Spanish and so I took French cuz I

225
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:07,190
know

226
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:09,380
Vietnam was colonized by the French so

227
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:10,850
they have lots of people who speak

228
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:12,410
French there some okay at least if I

229
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:14,090
ever go back which I'm actually playing

230
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,950
on hopefully doing nothing sometime

231
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:18,650
later this year but I've ever go back

232
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:20,740
then I can at least talk to some other

233
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:24,890
people think that'd be really cool

234
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:28,640
bonjour je m'appelle Carolyn Ashanti

235
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:31,160
Oh should we say boom

236
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,780
wow the axle is actually horrible

237
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:36,979
accidents are not my forte so

238
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:38,900
increasingly in as little as seven how

239
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:41,000
has being asian-american affected your

240
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:42,469
relationship with your parents I felt

241
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,090
really lucky that luckily I hasn't

242
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:45,950
affected it too much of my like you know

243
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,390
you can see it going like bad I can cry

244
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,650
and I think like the biggest thing is

245
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:50,650
they just don't understand a lot of

246
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:51,610
things they don't understand the way

247
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:52,780
for example there are a lot of

248
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:54,550
friendships and relationships you may

249
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:56,230
have where you're gonna have

250
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:58,330
conversations about race and it's gonna

251
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:00,070
be pretty difficult for you to navigate

252
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:02,080
and some friendships that you might have

253
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:03,940
to let go because you just have

254
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,650
different views on things and like I

255
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:09,970
never really realized this until I think

256
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:12,300
college I realized oh shoot like race is

257
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:15,040
something used to talk about and like

258
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,480
racism and if your friend like your

259
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,150
close friend doesn't get it it could be

260
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,380
really tricky and hard and sad and

261
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,370
hurtful it's hard to know what to do

262
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,930
with all those feelings I never

263
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:24,370
experienced this my parents I was like

264
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,690
oh we didn't know like that would happen

265
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:27,640
we didn't know how to handle that or

266
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,470
warn you and I was like oh my gosh no

267
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,000
like don't feel bad it's okay I think

268
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:32,230
sometimes yeah I can just be tricky when

269
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,090
I'm trying to explain things like Oh

270
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:35,650
today this thing happened to me it

271
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:37,120
really sad very like if I try to make a

272
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:40,390
joke because you know here is a good way

273
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:44,110
to kind of deal with some struggles in

274
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:47,430
life such thing at home and my parents

275
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:47,430
sometimes don't get it it was kinda like

276
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:52,750
it's all bad like I know they just kind

277
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:53,980
of get tired like say it a lot but other

278
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,060
than that they're really supportive and

279
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,680
they're always weighing tightly solutes

280
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:59,170
in which is really awesome and helpful

281
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:01,750
so that's the way it's affected my

282
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:03,640
relation of my parents question it is

283
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,590
how do you feel about your heritage now

284
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,820
I'll say I'm really proud of it now like

285
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:08,710
I said in middle school I don't identify

286
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:10,240
with it in high school I was a little

287
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:12,520
close for like the animation it's fine I

288
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,440
guess it wasn't like blue but then when

289
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,090
I got to college I actually I'm at the

290
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,190
college I took a class by dr. house

291
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:20,080
intro to culture in communications in

292
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:21,640
rhetoric and that was so high opening

293
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,620
for me because I didn't even know like

294
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,000
Asian Americans sounds wiegert's like I

295
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:29,440
didn't even know Asian Americans were a

296
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,880
group that were oppressed because the

297
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,440
model minority myth I totally bought

298
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,730
into that like I guess Asian Americans

299
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,020
are doing fine I don't really see

300
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:37,420
anything wrong beside the weird

301
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:39,520
microaggressions but in that classroom I

302
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:41,470
learned shoot I was like I already do

303
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,880
like I said okay females is definitely a

304
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,650
group that has problems I can see I get

305
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,910
you to weigh differently I am NOT valued

306
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:48,760
as much as others because I'm a female

307
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:50,080
but later I realized oh my gosh like I'm

308
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:54,670
also not valued because I'm Asian

309
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:55,720
American oh great so but I was like I

310
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:57,310
don't feel like I said because then I

311
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,080
started reading more into it I started

312
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:59,520
volunteering for like that if it go

313
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,440
penny

314
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:03,390
American Film Festival and really gonna

315
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,480
into wine to like spread Asian American

316
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:08,040
culture and specifically I visited meas

317
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,450
club on campus it was really awesome to

318
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,670
learn more about my culture and heritage

319
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:13,650
where I came from and now I would say

320
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:15,900
yes I am pretty proud to be Asian

321
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:18,210
American and specifically Vietnamese

322
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:20,880
American I think it's really awesome and

323
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:24,030
cool and it's like Who I am for my

324
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,900
identity and it's it's just cool I guess

325
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,730
man oh yeah

326
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,410
and also on terms being adopted I also

327
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:29,820
like got to be on this adoptee panel

328
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:31,110
which was really fun and to talk to

329
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,060
other doctors to kind of felt the same

330
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:34,950
way and get a lot of similar questions

331
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,540
as me but now I think it's really cool

332
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:38,730
and like makes it unique it gives me a

333
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:40,290
new perspective on life the last

334
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:42,720
question is what is your favorite part

335
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:44,610
about being asian-american / your

336
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,770
heritage I would say my favorite part

337
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:49,650
about community and specifically is bond

338
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:51,180
me love it it's my favorite food my

339
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:52,770
friend took me to this really good place

340
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:54,090
called best baguette it's actually in

341
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:56,430
Beaver Dam but I think they also have a

342
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:58,230
location in Portland there's a specific

343
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:59,730
kind of Vietnamese sandwich it is four

344
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:01,290
dollars and fifty cents for a sandwich

345
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:03,690
sometimes their sandwiches you can get

346
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:06,300
for less that is an incredible deal I

347
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:08,310
love saving and good deals and the

348
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,020
sandwich is amazing that's what I got

349
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:11,880
hands thing has my favorite bond means

350
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:14,580
I've ever had and I've had some like in

351
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:17,460
New York City I had somebody thicker I

352
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:18,780
tried some here oh my gosh get me

353
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:20,550
started there's a bunch of bomb me is it

354
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:23,190
a whitewash you're like what the heck is

355
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:27,210
that if it's not on a baguette you need

356
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:30,060
to question what you see get it that's

357
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:32,580
all I get just know that that's not the

358
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:35,670
traditional bond me was born me it was

359
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:37,020
like a fusion of France and Vietnam so

360
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:38,520
how's the Vietnamese flavor is a meat

361
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:41,100
inside and then it has the French

362
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:42,810
baguette my favorite one is the barbecue

363
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:46,320
pork or if anyone ever goes to get one

364
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:47,610
it's amazing but besides the Botany

365
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,130
sandwich specifically I think it's this

366
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:51,420
really awesome to share cultures I love

367
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:52,980
that I'm able to share that Vietnamese

368
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,720
heritage a lot of people here who may

369
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:57,420
not know about it and I think the cool

370
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,310
thing about being API is that it's so

371
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,840
diverse and so I'm always still learning

372
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:02,460
about all the different Asian cultures

373
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,530
and then all the subcultures within them

374
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:06,210
it's like you'll never be able to stop

375
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:07,980
learning about all of them and sharing

376
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:11,340
what you know about some of it with

377
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:13,170
other people and that's like my favorite

378
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:15,209
part about being Asian American

379
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:17,430
