1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:06,879

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:10,400
and welcome to my channel if you are new

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:12,880
uh so to start off um i

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,519
will be talking about uh what it was

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:19,199
like to grow up as a venus canadian here

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:22,240
and my experiences and observations

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,160
uh will vary from different

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,199
uh vietnamese canadians like of course

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:30,080
there are similarities and commonalities

10
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,279
um but here are some of the things that

11
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,079
i like to share

12
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,840
so to start off i am a first generation

13
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,239
canadia a vietnamese canadian

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,320
so meaning that my parents are

15
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:43,680
immigrants to canada

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,920
um my mother is from

17
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,360
the central vietnam and she came here

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:52,640
when she was approximately 26 years old

19
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:56,079
and my father came here when he was

20
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:59,760
in his early 30s they met in

21
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:02,239
toronto uh and then prior to

22
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,760
relocating and they got married um and

23
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:07,600
then relocated to

24
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:10,640
edmonton um so one of the

25
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:14,240
most common uh questions that i receive

26
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:17,840
is if i am able to speak

27
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,640
uh read and or write um it read in

28
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,840
vietnamese

29
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,240
and i would say this answer is yes um

30
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,759
it's just that the diff my proficiency

31
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,159
and comprehension level

32
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:32,479
like i can comprehend 100 um

33
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,360
so in regards to speaking i can speak

34
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,640
fluently

35
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,439
um like i understand fluently

36
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,079
reading i'm i would say an intermediate

37
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,399
level

38
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:47,600
and uh for writing it's still very basic

39
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,840
and i wish that i could

40
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,720
write better so that's the skill that i

41
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,479
want to

42
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:57,140
improve over um

43
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,560
the course of my lifetime um

44
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:00,799
[Music]

45
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,799
so i would say like the alphabet uh the

46
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,479
vegans alphabet is really

47
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,560
similar like the characters are really

48
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:09,679
similar to the western alphabet

49
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,879
um it's just a couple are different uh

50
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,000
we use a lot of

51
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:18,319
accents in the in the in

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,920
the sentence structure um

53
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,440
like and then i would say like the

54
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,800
reason being like why

55
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:28,000
the vietnamese alphabet is kind of

56
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:31,200
that uses kind of like western uh

57
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,879
characters is because uh the french

58
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,480
colonization

59
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:38,319
um so like before like the characters

60
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,200
used to be kind of like almost like

61
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:43,360
uh like chinese or japanese characters

62
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,120
as well like a long time ago

63
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:50,160
um so like even when we speak some words

64
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:53,280
um sound the same in

65
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,599
in french so for example the word

66
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,080
yogurt if you listen to the

67
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,000
pronunciation of yogurt in french

68
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,360
the pronunciation of yogurt and

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,920
vietnamese

70
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,840
it sounds almost exactly the same it's

71
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,360
just the pronounce or

72
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:12,480
the spelling of course is different

73
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,920
um so my vietnamese name

74
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,720
is yim mi um

75
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,560
so that means in english grace um and

76
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,280
then oftentimes what i also get

77
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,640
is if i'm able to translate my friends

78
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,040
names into

79
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,319
vietnamese and it's really difficult to

80
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,480
do so unless

81
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:34,959
um unless uh

82
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,720
like you were born or given a vietnamese

83
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,840
name

84
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,480
um i would and then also

85
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,159
in vietnamese cuisine like vietnamese

86
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,519
culture and heritage there

87
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,519
is a lot like a diverse like amount of

88
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,560
food like a lot of food

89
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,599
my top like i would say top three or

90
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,959
four i would say

91
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:59,840
is um bun sale

92
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,560
so that's kind of like a vietnamese

93
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,680
crepe

94
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,400
slash pancake it has like a

95
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,599
mung bean exterior and then it has

96
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,159
lettuce tomatoes

97
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,360
shrimp in it and sometimes bean sprouts

98
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,439
as well

99
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,120
and then people dip it in fish sauce and

100
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,720
it's really good

101
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:21,040
uh my second one uh would be bun me

102
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,079
so that's like a vietnamese like um

103
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,600
submarine

104
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,120
uh so they use like like a freshly baked

105
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,880
uh baguette

106
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:34,960
and then they have cilantro cucumbers

107
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:37,199
pickled carrots jalapenos and a cold cut

108
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,400
meat and then they also have like a pork

109
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,600
pate

110
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,720
and then um like a mayo

111
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:48,320
that's uh kind of mixed

112
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:51,840
or beaten like um egg yolks egg yolks

113
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:55,440
um and then also my favorite drink is

114
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,800
um cafe soda which is the vietnamese

115
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,120
iced coffee and it's

116
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,280
it comes out of like a like a french

117
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,280
press uh

118
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,440
machine almost and it's with condensed

119
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,800
milk or poured over ice and it's really

120
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,400
refreshing

121
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,720
in the summertime um

122
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,560
so also like one thing in the vietnamese

123
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,320
household that you'll always find

124
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:21,120
is fish sauce uh fish sauce is like

125
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,000
used in almost every savory dish that we

126
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,800
have in

127
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,560
vietnamese culture and it's really uh

128
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,960
like it tastes really delicious but

129
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,639
if it spills on you it's like i'll make

130
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:36,479
you stink the whole day

131
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:40,400
um it's so delicious though and then um

132
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:41,600
let's see uh in vietnamese culture we

133
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,680
also have like

134
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,440
if you enter vietnamese household like

135
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,479
you'll find like a lot of buddhas as

136
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,600
well

137
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:52,639
um we have like shrines and stuff where

138
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,880
um for elders that have passed away

139
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,680
and we also have buddhas there as well

140
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:02,720
at like in her home

141
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:05,280
um oh and i also forgot to mention about

142
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,360
like vietnamese language um in the

143
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,800
vietnamese language there is

144
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:14,639
um i'll say a couple dialects in there

145
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:17,440
um so like from south

146
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,479
uh central and north like there will be

147
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,720
different dialects

148
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,400
like you could really tell like if

149
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,360
you're like from outside

150
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,840
uh like if you're a westerner you can

151
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,880
really

152
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:32,639
recognize it or notice the difference

153
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,560
um and then um

154
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,160
because like when you're from the north

155
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,960
of vietnam like the accent from the

156
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,039
dialect is

157
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,759
thicker um and then also like certain

158
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,280
words like

159
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,280
of course like there'll be different

160
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,160
work uh different

161
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,919
um different words for the same thing

162
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,599
depending on the region that you're from

163
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,440
but like vietnamese people can

164
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,199
understand which dialect

165
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,639
and they can recognize which part of the

166
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,479
country that you're from so it's really

167
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,120
interesting it's not like

168
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,479
like um it's not that we can't

169
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,080
understand each other like all the

170
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,160
dialects have the same language

171
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,080
like we use like a common language it's

172
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,199
um

173
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:14,240
uh like i wouldn't say it's

174
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:17,680
like 100 different it's

175
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,720
varied um

176
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,680
and then uh so my experience growing up

177
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,639
it was

178
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,000
i would say it was fairly good um my

179
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,000
parents provided

180
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,080
like with us with all the necessary

181
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,919
things that we needed

182
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:36,160
and um i would say like

183
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,960
um growing up there's like a culture

184
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,680
clash

185
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:44,160
um a little bit uh so because like

186
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,599
i'm raised in a western society a

187
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,759
western culture

188
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:51,360
you could really say that

189
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,960
when i come home like my parents will

190
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,039
say oh you're so

191
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,840
uh you're so may or that means like

192
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,599
you're too westernized

193
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,960
um and then but when i'm with my friends

194
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,319
like they view me as

195
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,440
being vietnamese or being asian uh which

196
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:09,120
i am

197
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,720
but like um sometimes like if you don't

198
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,240
have a strong sense of self

199
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,039
it can really make you confused about

200
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,000
who you are

201
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,960
as a person and your identity like or am

202
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,560
i canadian

203
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,440
or in my vietnamese um so i like at the

204
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,599
end of the day

205
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,360
i feel like if you're from a different

206
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,120
culture if you're from a different

207
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,399
ethnic background

208
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,839
it's really important to uh take pride

209
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,479
in your culture because

210
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,880
that's that in reality that's who you

211
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,640
are

212
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,320
and you should not be ashamed um

213
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,519
because i feel like so a lot of people

214
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,279
that have dreaming cultures they

215
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,640
sometimes feel ashamed

216
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:52,839
and you shouldn't um

217
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:56,240
and then um i feel like also

218
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:58,320
like um a lot of times like when you're

219
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,120
first generation

220
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,000
like of any ethnicity or culture

221
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,839
sometimes

222
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,410
you when you're young you kind of want

223
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,560
to assimilate

224
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:10,560
[Music]

225
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,839
into western society and you lose your

226
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,000
language and

227
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,360
you feel that you should have to only

228
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,640
speak english

229
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:21,519
and to only follow um

230
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,720
like western culture i feel like in a

231
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,519
sense that's kind of

232
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,839
wrong and because then that way you lose

233
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,000
also your identity as well

234
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,640
um a sense of who you are and your you

235
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,959
lose your heritage and your culture

236
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,080
um like i mean you have to respect other

237
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,800
people's culture too but

238
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,720
don't try to become what you're not is

239
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,920
what i'm trying to say

240
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,480
um and then

241
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,080
um because like i really like growing up

242
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,000
i realized that was wrong too

243
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:54,800
and um like now i'm so

244
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,600
i'm so proud to be vietnamese i'm really

245
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,680
proud of

246
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,120
my heritage i'm really proud that i'm

247
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:04,560
able to

248
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:08,320
kind of uh read write and i'm able to

249
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,959
communicate to members of my culture

250
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,480
that aren't

251
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:15,680
able to speak english and i

252
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,600
am really proud that i am able to like

253
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,959
recognize different dishes

254
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:23,760
of my culture um in a pre like it's the

255
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:27,120
small things that you appreciate

256
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,560
um some of the vietnamese stereotypes

257
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,640
that we get from our culture

258
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:35,839
is that we either um

259
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,320
own or work at a meal salon which is

260
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,519
kind of

261
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,959
um which is kind of funny um

262
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,440
and then another stereotype that we get

263
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,839
a lot

264
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:51,200
is that we like to gamble

265
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:54,560
um so another

266
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,279
thing about vietnamese culture is that

267
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,880
the food

268
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:00,959
is so diverse um so one of the main

269
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,560
like or one of the popular dishes that

270
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:05,760
western society

271
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:09,120
um recognizes is uh

272
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,600
so that's uh spelled as p-h-o um and

273
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,160
there's

274
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,959
obviously some accents to that as well

275
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,839
um

276
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,040
so that's kind of like a vietnamese um

277
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,600
rice noodle soup

278
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,040
uh with like a beef broth um you can eat

279
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,160
it with a poison sauce

280
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:27,200
and also like a spicy um

281
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:30,959
spicy sauce as well a sriracha sauce

282
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:34,240
um i'm sure you guys know what that is

283
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:37,839
um and then

284
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,640
also for traditional wear or traditional

285
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,399
dress

286
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:45,680
in vietnamese culture is the it's ow

287
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:49,040
so it's spelt a o

288
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,480
d a i um and of course there are accents

289
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:54,000
to that as well

290
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:57,279
um so i have one um just speaking of

291
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,320
it um so this one i

292
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,440
bought when i went to vietnam with my

293
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,959
family

294
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,920
so traditionally like you like people

295
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:09,360
wear this

296
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,959
um like i like i would say it depends

297
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,800
also on the region because

298
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,160
the region of vietnam like different

299
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,519
regions of vietnam will have different

300
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,920
styles of aoi

301
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,120
so depending if you work on the farm as

302
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,519
a rice farmer

303
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,959
or if you're in central vietnam and also

304
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,320
your social class so

305
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,480
the beating and everything can be

306
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,519
different so this one i bought

307
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:32,160
um about eight nine years ago or

308
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,639
ten years ago like that's been that's

309
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,920
was the last time i was in vietnam

310
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,519
so yeah so it goes like this and it has

311
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,639
kind of like a slit

312
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,639
in the leg right here

313
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,160
so that's a slit and then um you would

314
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,480
wear like kind of like a silk

315
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:56,000
silk pants underneath uh just depending

316
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:58,639
um on the shade

317
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,399
or on the color of like the the actual

318
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,680
dress itself you would wear matching

319
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,680
silk pants underneath

320
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,040
okay and then depending on how formal

321
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,200
you are and how formal like

322
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,720
a formal the place that you're attending

323
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,959
or where you're going

324
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,959
you can wear like a headpiece as well

325
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:22,880
so that's how it looks

326
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,880
okay

327
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:30,560
and then um so like normally in

328
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:32,480
vietnamese weddings as well like

329
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,760
like the traditional wedding dress i

330
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,000
would say is white

331
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,040
or sorry red with the white pants

332
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,360
underneath

333
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,839
and some like really elaborate uh gold

334
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,880
design so it's really beautiful

335
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,279
um like and then our dress is similar

336
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,839
like

337
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,279
to chinese culture as well so like the

338
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,040
traditions like

339
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,560
we have it's kind of like a mix because

340
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,320
we had we're called we were calling that

341
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,920
like the country itself was colonized by

342
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,000
the french

343
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,959
um and then another thing i'd like to

344
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,079
mention is

345
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:06,880
um like the last time i visited

346
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:09,839
vietnam was with my family in 2010

347
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,320
um we went there for about two two weeks

348
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,519
almost

349
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:17,680
and it was like an amazing experience

350
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:19,519
um i believe i was about 14 or 15 at the

351
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,800
time

352
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:26,160
uh 15 16 yeah around that age

353
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:28,639
and um it was i would say

354
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,160
like a culture shock like even though i

355
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:33,199
am a vietnamese

356
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,360
descent and a vietnamese heritage

357
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,480
i still grew up in a western society in

358
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,560
a western culture

359
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,680
so like like going there like i was able

360
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,959
to of course like

361
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,600
speak it uh with like the individuals

362
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,360
there

363
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,199
the people there and i was able to

364
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,240
connect with my like my own

365
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:54,880
like culture and that aspect but like

366
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,279
the way of living in the standard living

367
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,199
was

368
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,800
completely different like the way

369
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:01,760
everything is structured

370
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,680
the infrastructure like one of my

371
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,160
favorite things about visiting vietnam

372
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,199
was

373
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:09,760
um of course like the street food

374
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,800
that was like amazing and like the

375
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,079
beaches

376
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,440
it was also amazing as well like like it

377
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,680
can't compare to here

378
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,720
like obviously here is like a lot more

379
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,279
cleaner

380
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,800
and things are a lot more like i would

381
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,279
say efficient

382
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,000
in the way that things are operating but

383
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,120
the culture

384
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,720
there the vibe it's really energetic

385
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,320
really fun um like and i'm sure

386
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,519
things have changed right now like the

387
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:40,079
technology in regards to technology

388
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,759
um like even maybe cleanliness has

389
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,320
changed a lot as well

390
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,120
um so like definitely i like to go back

391
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,480
and visit it

392
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:51,839
at the country um and

393
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,480
um yeah so like

394
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,440
i feel like now like i feel like i have

395
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,880
a lot of more

396
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:01,440
confidence in the way that i approach

397
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,680
things being vietnamese than canadian

398
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:07,440
like be having a strong sense of

399
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,800
identity and individuality um

400
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,720
like one of the main things that

401
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:15,040
vietnamese people have or like

402
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:18,320
asian countries i had is having strong

403
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,800
strong family ties so like being more of

404
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,360
a like

405
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,000
collect country while here like in

406
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,920
canada it's

407
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,399
more individualistic um

408
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,160
so like we have like as a vietnamese

409
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:33,440
person i have like

410
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:35,759
like um like

411
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,279
this mindset of having gratitude is a

412
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,360
lot stronger

413
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,800
so you're really grateful for what your

414
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,399
parents have done to you

415
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,040
you're really like you're really close

416
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:47,920
to your fam family ties

417
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:51,199
and you always try to grow together as a

418
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:54,480
unit um

419
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:56,399
and um like when i was like like this is

420
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,759
like kind of almost like a con almost

421
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:02,720
but like a common pro at the same time

422
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,000
um is like that we try to please and

423
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,000
seek approval

424
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,360
of our parents a lot and sometimes that

425
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,280
can

426
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:15,600
like um can i

427
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,600
i wouldn't say uh really

428
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:22,319
uh like like of course like everybody is

429
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:25,120
like their own ident like their own

430
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:28,480
individual a person but

431
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:30,400
sometimes a person coming from an asian

432
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,039
household we try to please

433
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,480
our parents a lot and we try to make

434
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,799
them happy we seek

435
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,640
their approval a lot and sometimes our

436
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,480
own identity can get lost

437
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,840
so that's kind of also a cultural clash

438
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,840
as well because um

439
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:50,000
being like being even though i'm

440
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,360
vietnamese canadian i'm not truly a

441
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,080
vietnamese like i'm

442
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,080
i'm still vietnamese but like like

443
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,000
like there's a mindset and the values

444
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,520
are diff really different because

445
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,679
being vietnamese canadian sometimes

446
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,160
you go after your passions and stuff

447
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,880
like that while if you were true like

448
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,480
uh full-blown vietnamese living in

449
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,640
vietnam

450
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,240
you would follow like the family

451
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,600
traditions like if a

452
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,600
family has a family business like you

453
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,120
you carry that on for generations and

454
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,960
generations while here it's more

455
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:29,679
individualistic

456
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:32,000
um so

457
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:34,240
like at the end of the day it's

458
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,280
important to embrace who you are

459
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,840
um as a vietnamese canadian well i try

460
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,840
to

461
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:44,000
embrace my culture culture and heritage

462
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:47,760
as much as i can into my daily lives

463
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:51,440
um but at the same time i have to

464
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,559
also uh respect my own values and how i

465
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,000
grew up as well as

466
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:57,360
a canadian um so there's like it's like

467
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,600
a lot of compromise

468
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,679
in respect to that like pleasing my

469
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,160
parents as well as pleasing my own

470
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,440
desires of what i want in life my own

471
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,120
passions

472
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:11,520
