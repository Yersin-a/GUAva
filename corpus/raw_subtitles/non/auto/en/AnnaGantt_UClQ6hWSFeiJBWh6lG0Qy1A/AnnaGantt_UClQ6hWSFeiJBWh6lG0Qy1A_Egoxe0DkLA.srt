00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,080
pull my hair back

8
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:16,890

9

September first

14
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:25,920
my one of my best

15
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,310
friends and her

16
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,310

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:35,190
Dragon Con which is this weekend

20
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:39,930
and I went on a whim

21
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:39,930
yesterday I bought

22
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:42,450
a one-day pass and

23
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,450
it was only $40 so

24
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:48,840
that I could attend

25
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:48,840
my first ever Dragon

26
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:52,520
Con and to be honest

27
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:52,520
it was very fun I

28
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:55,440
am pretty ignorant

29
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,440
on the whole like I

30
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,690
guess reasoning behind

31
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,690
Dragon Con like

32
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,320
all of the characters

33
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,320

35
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,789

36
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,000

37
00:01:02,779 --> 00:01:06,000

palette I like to

174
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:12,030
brighten areas I think

175
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:12,030
it's a lot like a

176
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:14,039
banana powder and

177
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,039

00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:15,989

watch a lot of

181
00:04:15,979 --> 00:04:17,940
tutorials so I like to

182
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:20,969
put the yellow to

183
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,969

184
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,949
the green on my red

185
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,949
areas which I like

186
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:24,500
my cheeks to be have

187
00:04:22,939 --> 00:04:24,500
some flushed to

188
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:26,450
them so I really apply in the

189
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:32,840
around my acne which

190
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:32,840
would be my chin

191
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:35,990
area right now I'll

192
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,990

197
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:43,100
go and watch movies

198
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:43,100

the purple where I

201
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:47,150
want to be black more

202
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,150
concealed I guess

203
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:49,370
you could say so I

204
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,370
like to put purple

205
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:51,950
around my nose and

206
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,950
then the lighter

207
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:53,420
shade I used to contour

208
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,420
like softer on

209
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:56,780
my forehead and then

210
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:56,780
the darker shade I

211
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:58,550
use for my cheekbones

212
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,550
so anyways I've

213
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:02,900
seen this movie

214
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:02,900
recently called good

215
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:04,490
time and it was so

216
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,490
good and I really

217
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,140
don't even like paying

218
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,140
the prices of the

219
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:08,270
movie theater because

220
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,270
it's so expensive

221
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,350
to go see a movie now

222
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,350
it's like twelve

223
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:13,040
dollars that's crazy

224
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:16,430
but whatever um anyways

225
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:16,430
I went to a good

226
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:20,060
time and it was

227
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:20,060
such a real movie I

228
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:23,330
cannot I cannot

229
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:23,330
explain to you enough

230
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:25,970
how crazy that was

231
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,970
the movie was crazy

232
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:29,350
it had me thinking

233
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,350
days after I saw it

234
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,350
like I'm still

235
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,850
it's just like one of

236
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,850
those very I guess

237
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,380
realistic movies

238
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,380
where you know this

239
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,970
situation could

240
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,970
happen to you and how

241
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:40,070
grateful you are that

242
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,070
you're not in it

243
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:43,640
and that's the best

244
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,640
way I can explain it

245
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:46,070
it has Edward Cullen

246
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:46,070
from Twilight

247
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,740
Robert okay I was

248
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,740
just about to ask

249
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:51,380
it's Robert Pattinson

250
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:51,380
Robert Pattinson

251
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:53,479
is in it he does a

252
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:53,479
fantastic job and has

253
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:57,050
a lot of new and

254
00:05:53,469 --> 00:05:57,050
upcoming actors as well

255
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:59,510
so it gave a lot of

256
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,510
exposure to them and

257
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:01,790
it won a lot of

258
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,790
awards at the Cannes

259
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:03,229
Film Festival this

260
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,229
year at one Civil War

261
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:05,330
so I don't know if you

262
00:06:03,219 --> 00:06:05,330
guys can tell but

263
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:08,270
it really that lidar

264
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,270
contour shade

265
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:10,100
really helps blur out

266
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,100
any problems you

267
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,570
have around your

268
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:11,570
hairline I love it

269
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,970
I don't know about

270
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,970
you guys are where

271
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:15,440
you live but here in

272
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,440
Georgia it's really

273
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:17,120
hard to wear a

274
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,120
foundation without it

275
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,890
coming off during

276
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,890
the day so I really

277
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,070
I'm skipping it

278
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,070
altogether today I'm

279
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:24,830
just doing a concealer and color

280
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:28,100
correction somedays

281
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:28,100
I will do the full

282
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:31,160
fledged full-face

283
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:31,160
foundation full

284
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:33,440
coverage everything

285
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,440
but today I want to

286
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,169
go a little bit more

287
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,169
natural after that

288
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,669
I'm gonna take

289
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:40,979
actual contouring brush

290
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:40,979
I blend out this

291
00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:45,360
harsh contour oh I

292
00:06:40,969 --> 00:06:45,360
guess I could talk

293
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:47,550
about the book cover

294
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,550
I have been chosen

295
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,069
to be a part of it's

296
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,069
gonna take place

297
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:51,599
later in September I

298
00:06:50,059 --> 00:06:51,599
don't know if you

299
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:54,810
guys can hear my

300
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:54,810
voice but I'm still

301
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:57,599
sick and I finally

302
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,599
pass by finally town

303
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:59,610
I finally found the

304
00:06:57,589 --> 00:06:59,610
penicillin that I

305
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,379
brought with me here

306
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,379
to college but I

307
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:03,990
really don't even

308
00:07:01,369 --> 00:07:03,990
like medication I'd

309
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:07,020
rather myself like

310
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:07,020
fight it off like my

311
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:11,400
own immune system fight

312
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:11,400
off but I'm what

313
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:14,999
I've got down my

314
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,999
nose and between my

315
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:16,560
brows and on my forehead

316
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:17,999
and I really don't

317
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,999
even like applying

318
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,009
makeup on my forehead

319
00:07:17,989 --> 00:07:20,009
because of my

320
00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:22,919
bangs but I am going

321
00:07:19,999 --> 00:07:22,919
to let them grow

322
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:25,349
out and they're almost

323
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:25,349
long enough that

324
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:28,229
I can part them in

325
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:28,229
the center and like

326
00:07:25,349 --> 00:07:29,999
shape them to the

327
00:07:28,219 --> 00:07:29,999
sides of my head but

328
00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:32,490
they're not quite

329
00:07:29,989 --> 00:07:32,490
there so I only apply

330
00:07:29,999 --> 00:07:34,349
concealer like right

331
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,349
up here I'm going

332
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:36,930
to take a Real

333
00:07:34,339 --> 00:07:36,930
Techniques brush and

334
00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:38,580
blend this out and

335
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,580
I really stopped

336
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:43,080
using a sponge

337
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:43,080
because I read this

338
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:45,750
article on all of the

339
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,750
bacteria oh if you

340
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:48,899
don't wash your

341
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,899
sponge or even your

342
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:51,990
brushes like once

343
00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:51,990
twice a week there's

344
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:53,879
so much bacteria that

345
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,879
builds in them and

346
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:56,099
the sponge was just a

347
00:07:53,869 --> 00:07:56,099
lot worse than the

348
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:58,649
brushes I use because

349
00:07:56,089 --> 00:07:58,649
of the water and

350
00:07:56,099 --> 00:08:01,080
it if it gets warm

351
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,080
then it like is

352
00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:03,449
harvesting terrible

353
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,449
bacteria for your

354
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,310
face I was like oh

355
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:05,310
my god so I threw

356
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:07,919
away my sponges and

357
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,919
now I'm just using

358
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:12,270
brushes that I'm

359
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:12,270
cleaning more regularly

360
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:16,110
oh my gosh so today

361
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:16,110

362
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:18,089
meeting at 2 p.m.

363
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,089
and then tomorrow I

364
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:20,550
have the opportunity

365
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:20,550
to go to Six Flags

366
00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:23,759
which I would totally

367
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,759
love to do but I'm

368
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:25,439
having to save money

369
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:25,439
oh my gosh if

370
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,210

00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:31,620
save your money

376
00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:34,889
because you're going

377
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:34,889
to need it later on

378
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:37,199
in life don't spend

379
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:37,199
it on ridiculous

380
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:38,669
things and I'm not

381
00:08:37,189 --> 00:08:38,669
saying going to Six

382
00:08:37,199 --> 00:08:41,639
Flags or any amusement park is

383
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:44,159
ridiculous but if you

384
00:08:41,629 --> 00:08:44,159
have other goals

385
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:46,980
and you have other

386
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,980
priorities oh my god

387
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,680
I feel like there's

388
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:47,680
a hair oh my god

389
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,089
there is

390
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,070
that's still annoying

391
00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:51,070
when you can't

392
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:55,000

393
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:55,000

394
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:58,630
all with some NIC

395
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,630
setting car anyways

396
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,750

00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:06,460
December if I don't

398
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:06,460
have any plans I

399
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:09,339
want to go somewhere

400
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:09,339
during my break off

401
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:11,800
school I possibly

402
00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:11,800
want to go out of the

403
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:12,880
country but if I

404
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:12,880
financially cannot

405
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,160
afford that and

406
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:15,160
I'll go somewhere

407
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,900
domestically like

408
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,900
there's this train

409
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,540
ride that goes from

410
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,540
Southern California

411
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:22,660
all the way up to not

412
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:22,660
Vancouver Canada

413
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:24,400
I'm sorry Seattle

414
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,400
Washington for like 90

415
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:27,339
something dollars

416
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:27,339
so really your only

417
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,990
major expenses getting

418
00:09:27,329 --> 00:09:28,990
a plane ticket to

419
00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:30,490
Southern California

420
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,490
if you don't already

421
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:32,200
live there

422
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:34,570
of course I live

423
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:34,570
in Georgia so it's

424
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,700
quite an expense to

425
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,700
get from the east

426
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:38,680
coast to the west coast

427
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,680
but I would love

428
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:43,510
to do that because

429
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:43,510
of only been to

430
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:45,490
California three times

431
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,490
I really want to

432
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:47,350
go experience like

433
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,350
Portland Oregon as

434
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:50,040
well and I love

435
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,040
Seattle I've been to

436
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:52,839
Seattle three times

437
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,839
and actually and

438
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:55,000
like if I ever have a

439
00:09:52,829 --> 00:09:55,000
job that allows me

440
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:56,709
to stay in Seattle I

441
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,709
would love to live

442
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,620
there just because

443
00:09:56,699 --> 00:09:59,620
of the weather and

444
00:09:56,709 --> 00:10:01,300
the coziness and the

445
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,300
coldness and of

446
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:03,370
course I'm studying

447
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,370
Mandarin and there's

448
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:05,830
a lot of Chinese

449
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,830
spoken in Seattle and

450
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:07,959
Vancouver Canada just

451
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,959
the west coast in

452
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:09,310
general there's a lot

453
00:10:07,949 --> 00:10:09,310
of Asian influence

454
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:12,760
and I love it so much

455
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:15,520
with a night another

456
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,520
NYX palette just a

457
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:22,330
cool tone go in

458
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:22,330
there and define a

459
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:25,900
little bit more the

460
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,900
sides of my nose and

461
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:27,459
my chinny-chin-chin

462
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,459
so anyways I just

463
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,500
think that would

464
00:10:27,449 --> 00:10:29,500
be so fun to do in

465
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:31,150
December because a

466
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,150
plane ticket if you

467
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,560
plan it far enough

468
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,560
in advance is only

469
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:34,420
about three hundred

470
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,420
and fifty dollars

471
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,520
and then you sleep on the train

472
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:42,010
overnight I'm gonna

473
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:42,010
go in with a little

474
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:45,850
bit of blush on my

475
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,850
cheeks okay on to

476
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:48,370
eyes I am going to

477
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,370
be using my masking

478
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:50,350
tape today to get

479
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,350
the perfect I shall

480
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:51,910
look but to finish

481
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,910
that story I just

482
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,680
think that that would

483
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,680
be an amazing trip

484
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:56,589
and you get to see

485
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:56,589
so much of the West

486
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,000
Coast for so cheap

487
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:58,000
and like you'd

488
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:58,350
actually get to

489
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,350
experience it because

490
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,670
you're not

491
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:01,770
taking like the

492
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,770
touristy route you're

493
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:03,300
taking like an actual

494
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,300
train route and

495
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:05,790
you get to sleep on

496
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,790
the train overnight

497
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:08,220
and then you get to

498
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:08,220
have like a full day

499
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,510
and each stop and

500
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,510
then you get like say

501
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,160
if you want to like

502
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,160
go somewhere you can

503
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:13,940
take a bus from that

504
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:13,940
stopping like go

505
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:16,680
further into California

506
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:16,680
or Oregon or

507
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:19,770
Washington State today

508
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,770
I'm going to do a

509
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:21,750
smoky I think with a

510
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,750
cut crease perhaps

511
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:26,550
I might actually zoom

512
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:26,550
you guys into this

513
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:29,460
oh my gosh that's

514
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:29,460
great okay moving on

515
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:32,910
to base the white

516
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:32,910
color I've already

517
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:38,310
just applied I'm going

518
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:38,310
to apply a little

519
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:40,860
bit more and then the

520
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,860
transition shade

521
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:43,650
in the crease and then a darker

522
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:47,310
transitions shade

523
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,310
closer to the actual

524
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:50,000
crease of your eye

525
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,000
and then even darker

526
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:50,000
one lower

527
00:11:53,900 --> 00:12:00,990
I'm going to pop like

528
00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:00,990
an orange II shade

529
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:08,730
right in the center

530
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:08,730
and they're like a

531
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:12,860
brown in the corner

532
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,860
and then like a dark

533
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:12,860
brown just to blend

534
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:18,210
okay now for a cut

535
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,210
crease I'm realizing

536
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:20,700
I'm not very good at

537
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,700
talking while I'm

538
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:23,400
doing eyeshadow I think

539
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:23,400
it's hard enough

540
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:26,130
already and then I

541
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:26,130
tried talking about

542
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:29,580
the stuff oh I love

543
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,580
looking at myself at

544
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:31,380
having eyelashes

545
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,380
yeah I know that you

546
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:34,950
guys really want to

547
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:34,950
see more videos on

548
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:37,590
that I just felt

549
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,590
awkward honestly

550
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:40,800
talking about I don't

551
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,800
feel awkward I

552
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:42,540
just felt sad maybe

553
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,540
when I'm talking

554
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,420
about trichotillomania

555
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:45,420
I don't know why

556
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:47,880
I guess because I'm

557
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,880
battling with it for

558
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:49,020
so long it just is

559
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,020
something annoying

560
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,760
and whenever you

561
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:50,760
have to talk about

562
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:53,820
something you don't like it gets

563
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:56,190
annoying but like

564
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:56,190
it's fine for me to

565
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:58,890
talk about I just it's

566
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,890
not like my first

567
00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:01,260
choice of a topic

568
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,260
video but I realize a

569
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:05,090
lot of people do want

570
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:05,090
to hear about it

571
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:07,590
and I do need to

572
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,590
spread awareness so

573
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:10,200
anyway it's going in

574
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,200
with a brush for a

575
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:12,420
cut crease I have

576
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,420
a little bit of

577
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:15,570
concealer on my hand

578
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:15,570
and we're going to

579
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:17,670
apply that just on

580
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,670
the center on my

581
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:19,590
natural eyelid so I

582
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,590
didn't bring it all

583
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:22,320
the way across I'm

584
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:22,320
only doing the very

585
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:23,940
inside okay now

586
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:23,940
time for a shimmer

587
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,550
shadow I'm going to

588
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:25,550
apply this with my

589
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:30,060
finger just because

590
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:30,060
I feel like it a

591
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:36,000
adheres better to the

592
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:36,000
cut crease I think

593
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:38,070
I'm gonna choose a

594
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:38,070
gold yeah this color

595
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,650

just gonna highlight

636
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,100
my brow bone with a

637
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:57,510
white shade for my

638
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,510
bottom shadow I'm

639
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,730
gonna take the orange shade the

640
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:03,840
transition shade and

641
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,840
just line under my

642
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:05,910
eye ooh I kind of

643
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,910
like that actually

644
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,980
okay it's coming

645
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,980
together I'm not being

646
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:09,450
and then we're gonna

647
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,450
blend that out I'm

648
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:12,360
gonna take a break

649
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,360
from my eyes and a

650
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:15,030
highlight and just

651
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:15,030
blow that out okay

652
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:17,640
for my brows it's

653
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,640
gonna darken them

654
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:19,920
using a NYX mascara nice

655
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:22,170
I love the bold brow

656
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,170
if you can't tell

657
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,060
so just looking in

658
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,060
the monitor I think

659
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:25,440
that my black is

660
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,440
pretty patchy on the

661
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:33,210
outside so I'm gonna

662
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:33,210
go back in and

663
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:35,160
darken that up and

664
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,160
blend it okay I think

665
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:36,540
that corrected part

666
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,540
of the problem okay

667
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,850
now that my lips are

668
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,850
line I'm gonna go

669
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:45,510
in with this berry

670
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:45,510
color sorry for my

671
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:47,550
acne right here it

672
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,550
happens this color is

673
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:49,470
very dark as you can

674
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,470
see and I kind of

675
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:51,839
want to lighten it up

676
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,839
in the center with

677
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:54,110
a nude color so I'm

678
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:54,110
gonna grab that real

679
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,110
quick

680
00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:00,770
think I'm just gonna

681
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,770
stick to mascara

682
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:06,250
honestly I'm just

683
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:06,250
gonna curl my lashes

684
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:06,250
and do mascara on the

685
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:12,320
kind of hurts and

686
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:12,320
it's funny because

687
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:15,290
whatever I used to

688
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:15,290
pluck my lashes it

689
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,250
did not hurt and

690
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,250
people will whenever I

691
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:18,350
tell them that I have

692
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,350
trichotillomania

693
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:20,030
and like I used to

694
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,030
pluck my lashes

695
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:23,840
they're like oh my

696
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,840
gosh this I heard and

697
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:25,400
no it doesn't actually

698
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:25,400
and I don't know

699
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:28,340
if that's because I'm

700
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:28,340
like a chemical in

701
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:30,470
our brain that makes

702
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,470
it not hurt or what

703
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:32,090
but honestly this

704
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,090
hurts like curling my

705
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:36,070
lashes hurts more

706
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:36,070
than whenever I used

707
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:36,070
to pull them out it's crazy

708
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:45,080
see how my bangs are

709
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,080
almost long enough

710
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:47,000
to blend in if they

711
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,000
go to the side it's

712
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,530
such an awkward length

713
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,530
right now because

714
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,630
then if I pull them

715
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,630
to the front they're

716
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:54,050
kind of long I think

717
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:54,050
I'll just leave it

718
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:56,240
at that I'm gonna

719
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,240
change clothes and be

720
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:57,830
