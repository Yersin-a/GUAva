1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,589
hello I'll go back to my channel so

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:07,170
today I'm going to be doing the Mexican

3
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:09,450
American tag and actually Diego tagged

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:12,750
me in a while back I just haven't been

5
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:15,269
able to do it so yeah I'm gonna do it

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,730
now okay let's just jump right into it

7
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:19,949
because I really I didn't do a get ready

8
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,900
with me and I don't have food to eat for

9
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:24,060
a mukbang so I'm just gonna talk to

10
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,599
y'all if that's okay so the first one is

11
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:29,849
which ethnicity are you I'm gonna say

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,759
Mexican American I feel like I have

13
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:35,489
trouble with just defining ethnicity and

14
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,960
I even googled it before um but yeah so

15
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:39,989
I'm just gonna say Mexican American

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:43,950
because my parents are from Mexico and I

17
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:47,100
was born here and I'm yeah so Mexican

18
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:49,350
American okay number two which

19
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,570
generation are you so I am first

20
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:54,030
generation because my parents actually

21
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,760
immigrated here like in the early 90s

22
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,739
and I was born here so I feel like that

23
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,649
makes me first gen sometimes people use

24
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:03,449
first generation for even just

25
00:01:00,649 --> 00:01:05,460
educational purposes like first gen

26
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:08,070
college students so I was the first one

27
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,439
to go to college in my family so yeah

28
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:13,080
first generation I feel like except that

29
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:16,740
like five times already but point made

30
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,119
Stephanie um anyways number three what

31
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,710
is the first experience where you felt

32
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,990
that discrimination of being a minority

33
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,729
/ different it's kind of tough because I

34
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,570
live in a primary lefty next community

35
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:26,729
in Inglewood

36
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:29,280
I feel like English kind of sped up with

37
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:30,720
black and Athene X and I'm in that

38
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,630
laughing next side obviously that's

39
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:37,500
gonna start changing soon but when I was

40
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:40,079
in Middle School where it was equally

41
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,939
black and equally lucky necks

42
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,299
I felt like different from other people

43
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:47,390
for sure I just didn't have that

44
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:51,149
American high school chair kind of add

45
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:54,030
sometimes it was obvious that it was

46
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:56,490
uncool to not have that so that's when I

47
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,759
feel like I started assimilating to the

48
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:02,130
dominant culture its controversial but

49
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,110
I've noticed that some of the the black

50
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:08,220
students in my middle school would make

51
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:10,349
fun of how I set things like England i

52
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,420
--q Peaks like all these things so and

53
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:13,560
like people joke around make fun of how

54
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,480
I say things now

55
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,550
I'm just like it's like triggering

56
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,739
because you know like I've was made fun

57
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:20,970
of it before so it's just like little

58
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:23,130
things like that it's not really big

59
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:26,489
things and I'm never gonna say that you

60
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:30,269
know we're the most oppressed community

61
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:33,090
cuz we're not but definitely like it was

62
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:34,950
kind of like a culture shock to be in a

63
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,489
school that was half black half latina

64
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,610
'xs

65
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:40,769
when I was in a school that was

66
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:44,430
primarily lucky next in elementary

67
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:44,970
school and it was a reality check number

68
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,680
four

69
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,810
were you always proud of your heritage

70
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,060
or was there a time you rejected it

71
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:53,100
there was a time I rejected it of course

72
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,830
I feel like a lot of people who are

73
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:57,390
first gen go through this experience it

74
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:00,390
doesn't matter with it what ethnicity

75
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:04,140
you are I feel like living in the United

76
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:05,970
States it's kind of inevitable to want

77
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:08,130
to feel shame or rejection for your

78
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:10,260
culture so I definitely felt that like I

79
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:12,840
said I feel like in middle school when

80
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:15,720
my cousins and all like everyone around

81
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,069
me started simulating more to the you

82
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,630
know dominant culture and it's not

83
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:21,840
really necessarily white culture because

84
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:24,329
it could be like hip-hop or whatever so

85
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,120
it's just like when other people start

86
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:30,390
telling you that being proud of your

87
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,579
culture is wrong you start believing it

88
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:34,890
at one point and I don't remember when

89
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:37,170
that switched in my head but I

90
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:39,780
definitely other people definitely

91
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:41,670
influence how you see yourself and how

92
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,310
you see your people how you see your

93
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:46,590
community and you know for a really long

94
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:49,920
time in my youth like a really long time

95
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:53,400
like the majority of my upbringing I was

96
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,920
trying to reject my culture so that

97
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:59,489
question were you always proud no I

98
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,170
wasn't I think college actually helped

99
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:04,350
me become proud of my heritage my

100
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:05,310
culture and embrace it and not be

101
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:07,230
ashamed of it

102
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:09,299
um and I know a lot of people don't have

103
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:12,209
the privilege of going to college but I

104
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:15,660
feel like college really helped me learn

105
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:20,400
unlearn these kind of I don't know learn

106
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:22,550
like hating my heritage or maybe the

107
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,650
whole time I was like from like

108
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:28,250
elementary school to high school

109
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:32,060
yeah I hated my culture um I didn't want

110
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:33,919
to be me and it's funny because I had

111
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:37,400
done the body and I forehead so

112
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:39,199
like obviously like I can't fully reject

113
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,699
my culture because I'm not white Patsy

114
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,620
it makes me happier than I'm not why

115
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:44,479
passing because I feel like if I was I

116
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:47,930
wouldn't be doing this video right now

117
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:50,710
like I wouldn't be so about my culture

118
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:53,690
because I rejected it for so long that

119
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:56,120
it like would have affected me if I

120
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:57,350
physically match that rejection if that

121
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,360
makes sense I don't really make sense I

122
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:01,790
think in colleges when I started hanging

123
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,010
out with my friends who actually taught

124
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:06,410
me more about myself than I knew yeah I

125
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:08,389
was it was really eye-opening and I'm

126
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:10,580
still friends with these people and I'm

127
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:13,340
really happy that they came into my life

128
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:15,200
because I don't want my kids or I don't

129
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:20,750
want like people other people in this in

130
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:23,000
this country who are not white to hate

131
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:24,500
who they are because they aren't why so

132
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,840
that's kind of like my thing and that's

133
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,310
why I focus a lot of my content and I'm

134
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,350
so happy I work that me too because I

135
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:32,300
got to create content for the Latina

136
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:34,729
community but I also want to keep doing

137
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:37,010
that in film TV and all that because I

138
00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:38,630
don't want that to be lost anywhere and

139
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:41,120
I want us to be able to have these

140
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:44,060
stories told in the big screen or the

141
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,320
small screen whatever but I just don't

142
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,729
want that to be forgotten

143
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:49,039
okay this students really serious really

144
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:50,539
okay let's just go number five what are

145
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:54,080
some stereotypes that you struggle with

146
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:56,539
I feel like as a whole I personally I

147
00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:00,500
feel like I don't really struggle with

148
00:05:56,539 --> 00:06:03,169
stereotypes I haven't I haven't been

149
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:05,960
surrounded by white people personally as

150
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:07,610
much I just know stereotypes on TV and

151
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,320
stuff like that I mean I guess we can

152
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:12,370
talk about those I feel like those

153
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:15,400
stereotypes that we are lazy and more

154
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:19,330
like the help or we have a heavy accent

155
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:20,680
or were this curvaceous like latina I'm

156
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:23,430
just like listing all the stereotypes

157
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,389
that I know of or that were like

158
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:27,790
irresponsible it's like all these like

159
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:30,580
different things um I feel like those

160
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:33,690
are just stereotypes of Hollywood has

161
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:35,800
implemented on us but don't necessarily

162
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:37,780
representative us

163
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,960
so yeah just changing that up in

164
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:43,210
Hollywood would be a great thing to do a

165
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,610
que that's what I want to do but also I

166
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:48,100
think within you know like media always

167
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:50,590
reflects the greater country or the

168
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:52,389
greater world so I feel like there's

169
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:55,330
always a stereotype that we're like

170
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:57,639
stealing people's jobs or you know thank

171
00:06:55,330 --> 00:07:02,320
documented are just you know immigrants

172
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:04,990
from Latin countries are stealing

173
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:07,360
people's jobs first of all you wouldn't

174
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:09,940
even do half the job that my parents do

175
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,430
you know they're doing these jobs that a

176
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:14,979
lot of people don't want to do so if

177
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:17,680
you're down to go clean your friends

178
00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:19,990
 big-ass mansion and Pacific

179
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,020
Palisades or if you're down to go put up

180
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:25,180
drywall in you know these mansions these

181
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:28,330
big ol houses all over the the west

182
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:30,370
coast then go for it take my parents

183
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:32,410
jobs and see if you can do it because if

184
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:35,320
they're taking your jobs right so go for

185
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:36,010
it try it but I just know that you won't

186
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:40,570
last

187
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:43,919
not even a day you know um so I think

188
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:46,630
that's a big serotype that I hate um

189
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:49,270
yeah and that word lazy and like

190
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:51,729
excuse me like our parents don't let us

191
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:53,380
sleep in on Saturday mornings cuz they

192
00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:56,080
want us cleaning like even my mom now

193
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:58,510
when I live on my own my own she's like

194
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:03,460
are you up well I'm just like mm-hmm

195
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:05,470
you know so yeah um and just um that

196
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:07,120
were like moochers and stuff like we're

197
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:10,539
definitely not

198
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,789
we are definitely I feel like one of the

199
00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:15,070
most hard-working community out there

200
00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:16,270
and we're always hustling especially

201
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:17,889
when you see people in our community

202
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:19,240
that are you know selling flowers by the

203
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:21,190
freeways and they put it down the

204
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,380
streets I think the malleus model was

205
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:24,350
like those are hustlers and it's like we

206
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:26,360
never stop

207
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:27,980
mostly so stops having us pretty lazy

208
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:31,460
and stop telling us we're taking your

209
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:33,140
jobs cuz we're not and there's probably

210
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:35,570
a lot more but these are just things I

211
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:36,260
could go to the top of my head number

212
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:39,710
six

213
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:42,260
um can you speak your language yes I can

214
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:44,330
I have the privilege to be able to speak

215
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,550
Spanish but you know I think that's

216
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:48,830
something I strolled with too because my

217
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:53,210
parents did teach me Spanish first I am

218
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:55,280
yes so so I did take a long time to pass

219
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:57,110
out like ESL test I think I even had to

220
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,690
take it like ninth grade because I just

221
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:01,880
wasn't passing it I'm like not ashamed

222
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:04,880
of that because that just means that my

223
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:08,600
native tongue was so prevalent in my

224
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,940
upbringing in my language that it just

225
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,800
wasn't going to be overthrown by English

226
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:15,170
you know so I feel like I made a mistake

227
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,330
with um speaking English to my brothers

228
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:19,940
when they were growing up because now I

229
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:21,650
feel like even the youngest English is

230
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:23,120
his primary language is his first

231
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:25,760
language is the language he's

232
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,170
comfortable with because my parents were

233
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,210
speaking to in Spanish but I was

234
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:30,620
speaking to them in English and if I

235
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:32,330
speak to him in English and everyone

236
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,770
else does like in the freaking world

237
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:35,660
like school and all that like that's

238
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:37,550
gonna be the language he's more

239
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:39,950
comfortable with so right now he's

240
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:42,710
trying to relearn Spanish but I feel

241
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:45,380
like I could have helped stop that if I

242
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:48,020
helped him just speak more Spanish at

243
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:50,930
home but that wasn't a time where I was

244
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:53,360
like legit rejecting my culture and like

245
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:55,730
knowing that if he knows I'm English as

246
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,310
a primary language that he will

247
00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:00,020
assimilate easier and have less trouble

248
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:02,270
growing up in this world

249
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:04,040
getting a job all blah even though

250
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:06,110
that's obviously it's better easy to be

251
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:09,040
bilingual but you know me and high

252
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:13,160
school thinking that in middle school I

253
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:16,700
didn't allow him to have Spanish as a

254
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:19,520
first language so that's my bad but you

255
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:21,170
know we're trying now and it's hard

256
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,630
because now you have to reteach these

257
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:26,120
things but I know that if I ever have

258
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:28,850
kids I don't want them to have English

259
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:33,110
as a first language because I want them

260
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:36,890
to at least keep something from their

261
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:38,030
culture you know so yeah Spanish is my

262
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:40,010
first language and

263
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:43,040
I know how to speak it kind of write it

264
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:46,370
and definitely read it so yeah I

265
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:48,560
actually learned the Spanish ABCs before

266
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:50,270
I learned the English ABCs and I was

267
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,280
actually just spanish-speaking when I

268
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:53,960
came into kindergarten because my

269
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,180
parents both taught me and read to me in

270
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,590
Spanish when I was growing up so I don't

271
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:00,290
remember those times but I'm very

272
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:02,900
grateful for them number seven

273
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:04,850
how has being mexican-american affected

274
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:06,680
your relationship with your parents me

275
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:09,080
wanting to continue to assimilate

276
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,700
growing up really affected my

277
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,010
relationship with my parents because I

278
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:16,490
was trying to reject the very thing they

279
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:21,470
were trying to treasure and you know

280
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:24,020
ingrain and you know bond with me about

281
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:26,480
and I just wasn't letting it happen like

282
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:28,550
I would reject other Spanish music ever

283
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,160
checked all the TV shows I would watch I

284
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:33,590
would you know these conversations would

285
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,850
go on and on and on and um now I'm

286
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:36,920
trying to be more open-minded about it

287
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:39,020
but I was like it'll take that bad knock

288
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,490
off like I don't like that I'm gonna

289
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:44,210
listen to that I want to listen to

290
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:46,310
all-time low or blink-182 or wood you

291
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:48,230
know whatever so definitely like

292
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:51,140
everything everything everything that

293
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:52,640
they said for I was trying to reject so

294
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:54,730
I feel like that really affected our

295
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:58,100
relationship while I was growing up

296
00:11:54,730 --> 00:12:00,980
especially in my like teen years yeah

297
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:03,850
and I feel like now I'm a fighter for

298
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:06,770
the for our culture within my household

299
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:09,170
now I do try to talk to my brother's

300
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:11,090
about how important it is to keep our

301
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:13,340
cultural life and I'm on my parents side

302
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:15,980
and I completely understand my brothers

303
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:19,130
but I also now understand my parents and

304
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:21,230
I'm trying to bridge that gap and be the

305
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:22,550
middle person in that feel like over the

306
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:24,680
years our relationship has gotten

307
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:26,150
stronger and I feel like a lot of y'all

308
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:31,160
can see my relationship with my mom

309
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:32,750
being really really really strong so it

310
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:36,290
wasn't ever it wasn't always like that

311
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:38,450
so I feel like me being able to be more

312
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:40,370
open-minded about stuff like that has

313
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:43,460
actually helped my relationship with my

314
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:48,250
parents I've become closer than it was

315
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:50,590
way like then it was like before so yeah

316
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:53,500
it's got him better but it was never

317
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:55,180
this good and number eight how do you

318
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:59,380
feel about your heritage now do you

319
00:12:55,180 --> 00:13:02,590
identify with him um yes um so I

320
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:04,540
actually am a fighter for my community

321
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:08,260
I'm a fighter for my culture and my

322
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:10,240
heritage and all that now and like I

323
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:14,530
said it was a really long journey to get

324
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:17,440
here like extremely long but I just felt

325
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:19,030
you know that switch in your head where

326
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,810
you just don't want to simulate it

327
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:25,270
anymore and you do want to be able to

328
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:27,460
continue to tell these stories of your

329
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:30,160
culture and these traditions in your

330
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:33,330
culture so I feel like now I identify it

331
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,110
with a hundred percent I'm still

332
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:37,750
mexican-american though you know I'm not

333
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:39,790
gonna be completely like Mexican I'm not

334
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,260
gonna be completely American like they

335
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:43,360
say any that Keeney that yeah I like

336
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:46,750
that is me and that is a lot of people

337
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:49,720
that um are my age and around that age

338
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:51,640
you know yeah so I do identify with it

339
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,910
I'm still struggling with trying to

340
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:57,070
rebuild that inside my head because I

341
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:59,590
did reject it for so long but I'm doing

342
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:03,880
it you know I'm here for it I feel like

343
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:05,020
I wish I identified as Chicana and I

344
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,180
feel like the only reason I don't

345
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:09,040
identify as Chicana and I haven't really

346
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:11,860
told a lot of people this is because I

347
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:15,010
feel like I don't deserve it because I

348
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:19,480
rejected it for so long and I feel like

349
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:24,600
Chicanos a certain type of term I didn't

350
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:27,910
identity that I still don't fully

351
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:30,730
associate myself with and it's not like

352
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:31,930
oh it's like lower than me like all

353
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:33,940
these things it's definitely not bad

354
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:36,070
it's just that I feel like I don't

355
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:37,000
qualify to be a Chicano y'all let me

356
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:39,190
know because I don't know what that

357
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,660
means but um you know I feel like I

358
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:42,340
haven't learned about that term enough

359
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,430
and all that so that's why I say am i

360
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:46,570
latina or I'm mexican-american but

361
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:49,510
identifying as Chicana for me is a

362
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:51,160
little bit harder because I don't I know

363
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:53,980
it means X again American but I don't

364
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:56,170
understand exactly house 1 is a Chicano

366
00:14:56,170 --> 00:15:01,350
did she gotta means to you or to the

367
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,490
culture because I'm struggling

368
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:05,640
I'm still trying to struggle if

369
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:07,350
identifies chicken or not but definitely

370
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,090
not be not definitely Mexican America so

371
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:12,180
number nine what is your favorite thing

372
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:13,080
about being mexican-american I feel like

373
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,960
my favorite thing about being

374
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:17,940
mexican-american is the community that

375
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:21,090
we have and how strong the bond is

376
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:24,390
between a lot of people I do want to

377
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:27,930
bring in more different identities

378
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:29,340
within the Latin American population um

379
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:31,620
I feel like being mexican-american

380
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:35,190
American is cool and all but I feel like

381
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:38,670
we're still very like we need to let in

382
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:40,860
other communities in the whole latina

383
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:42,840
identity Latino a lot the next identity

384
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:45,150
because I feel like right now a lot of

385
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:47,220
mexican-americans are gorgeous Mexicans

386
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:49,020
in general are like here and there like

387
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:52,290
putting down all the other cultures and

388
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:54,270
I feel like for me um even making

389
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:57,270
content at me too I was always trying to

390
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:58,650
keep an eye out for being able to do

391
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:01,020
videos that were not just for

392
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:03,330
mexican-americans Chicanos I wanted to

393
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:05,070
bring in Salvadorian coach I want to

394
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:07,230

395
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:09,390
that and what that means and all these

396
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:12,090
things so like my goal is always to you

397
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:13,890
know help other cultures come up because

398
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:15,420
there's so much content out there for

399
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:17,400
mexican-americans why can't we have that

400
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:19,230
other people oh yeah so that sense of

401
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:22,950
community I really love I love the

402
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:24,860
language I love the slang that you know

403
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:28,950
that we have within the Spanish language

404
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:31,410
I love the fact that it brings people

405
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:33,570
together and you bond over one thing or

406
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:37,380
another because not every that Phoenix

407
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:38,820
is the same or even each other's

408
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,770
backgrounds are completely different

409
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:43,530
even if you do come from Mexico like

410
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:45,060

411
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:46,920

415
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:58,890
northern Mexico as Bobby and Oh Bobby

416
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:00,630

417
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:02,220
know how different everything is and I

418
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:04,770
really appreciate it and I really

419
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:07,020
appreciate the different backgrounds

420
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:10,290
that we are but we all still identify as

421
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:12,260
one um so that's pretty cool and I'm

422
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:14,270
still learning a lot I'm still open to

423
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:16,850
new things I'm never gonna

424
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:18,709
stop learning about Who I am especially

425
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:22,370
now because it took so long to get here

426
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:24,620

427
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:26,390
peeps and and I'm never gonna stop

fighting for us and I'm always going to

429
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:31,370
be pushing for representation and I feel

430
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:32,420
like that's my mission in life and I

431
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:34,280
know a lot of people have different

432
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:35,810
missions and stuff but I really want to

433
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:38,540

434
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:41,180
really important for us so yeah that was
