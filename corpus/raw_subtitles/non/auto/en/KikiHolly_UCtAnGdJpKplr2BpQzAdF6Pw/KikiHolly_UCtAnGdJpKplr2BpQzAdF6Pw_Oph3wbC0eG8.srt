00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:08,199

00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,800

7
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:20,349

8
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,349
I've been posting a

9
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:23,220
lot of videos but I

10
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:23,220
feel like you guys

11
00:00:20,349 --> 00:00:26,140
don't really know me

12
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,140

00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,119
this tag and I have

15
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,520
the questions on my

16
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:30,520
phone so I'll be

17
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:34,420
looking down at that

18
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,420
but let's get into

19
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:38,500
it a one when were

20
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,500
you born so I was

21
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:41,170
born September 4th

22
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,170
1995 I'm 23 years old

23
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:44,080
and I have the same

24
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,080
birthday as Beyonce

25
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:45,640
which is cool in theory but she

26
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:49,750
definitely still a

27
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:49,750
little bit of my

28
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,710
shine um - where are

29
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:50,710
you from and are

30
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:53,589
you proud of it

31
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:56,290
so I'm from Las Vegas

32
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:56,290
Nevada I was born

33
00:00:53,589 --> 00:00:58,659
here I was raised

34
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,659
here I'm and I lived

35
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:01,030
here currently however

36
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:01,030
I went to college

37
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:03,519
in Virginia and I

38
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,519
interned in Seattle

39
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:06,760
and so I had those

40
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:06,760
two experiences

41
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:09,220
outside of Las Vegas

42
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,220
am i proud of it

43
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,380
yes because like

44
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,380
everywhere I go and I

45
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:14,229
tell people I'm from

46
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,229
Las Vegas they're

47
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:18,039
like oh my gosh

48
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:18,039
that's so cool I'm so

49
00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:20,649
jealous blah blah

50
00:01:18,029 --> 00:01:20,649
blah but personally I

51
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:22,750
would have wished

52
00:01:20,639 --> 00:01:22,750
to be like born

53
00:01:20,649 --> 00:01:24,729
somewhere else like

54
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,729
maybe the south or

55
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:26,890
New York it just

56
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:26,890
seems like a little

57
00:01:24,729 --> 00:01:29,320
more diverse and more

58
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,320
exciting and I can

59
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:32,229
see myself moving

60
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,229
to one of those

61
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:36,009
locations and when was

62
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:36,009
the last time you

63
00:01:32,229 --> 00:01:38,289
cried so this is

64
00:01:35,999 --> 00:01:38,289
funny I'm 23 but I'm

65
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:40,899
still a crybaby I

66
00:01:38,279 --> 00:01:40,899
still cry when I get

67
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:43,899
my feelings hurt I

68
00:01:40,889 --> 00:01:43,899
don't know why I

69
00:01:40,899 --> 00:01:46,929
can't help it but

70
00:01:43,889 --> 00:01:46,929
last time I cried was

71
00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:49,810
my sister spoiled

72
00:01:46,919 --> 00:01:49,810
the show this is us

73
00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:51,579
for me and they're

74
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,579
just really annoyed

75
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,289
me I was like how

76
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,289
dare you spoil it and

77
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:55,780
it was more of a

78
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,780
build-up because I feel

79
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:58,149
like my mom and my

80
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,149
sister like their

81
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:00,850
goal in life is to

82
00:01:58,139 --> 00:02:00,850
spoil shows for me

83
00:01:58,149 --> 00:02:02,920
like they'll try and

84
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,920
be sneaky about it

85
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:05,319
like oh I'm not

86
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,319
spoiling the story but

87
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,319
this happened and so

88
00:02:05,309 --> 00:02:08,319
I was just really

89
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:09,850
upset I really like

90
00:02:08,309 --> 00:02:09,850
that show so that

91
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:13,000
was the last time I

92
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,000
cried but that was

93
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:14,850
actually like a week

94
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,850
ago so it's been a

95
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,530
while since I cried it's not

96
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:20,820
I cried yesterday do

97
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,820
you have kids if no

98
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:24,420
how many do you want

99
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:27,930
so no I do not have

100
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,930
any kids I would say

101
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:30,420
I want two kids one

102
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,420
boy one girl um I

103
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:33,060
definitely would

104
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:33,060
want at least two so

105
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,710
they could have like

106
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,710
that like sibling

107
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,260
bond like I feel

108
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,260
like that bond is

109
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:40,320
unmatched like you

110
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,320
don't have that bond

111
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:42,330
with anyone else so

112
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,330
I would say the two

113
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,460
kids but the most I

114
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,460
would have is four

115
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:47,010
like if I was like

116
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,010
in a crazy situation

117
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:52,110
where I decided to

118
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,110
have a ton of kids it

119
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:55,140
would be maxed out at

120
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,140
four um what's the

121
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:57,420
first thing you notice

122
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,420
about people so I

123
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:59,640
noticed two things I

124
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,640
noticed their smile

125
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,610
and then I noticed

126
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,610
their overall like

127
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:04,080
aura and their energy

128
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,080
like I noticed

129
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:05,910
that they have

130
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,910
negative energy or

131
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,730
positive energy if

132
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,730
they seemed like a

133
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:10,260
friendly person or

134
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,260
you know a confident

135
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:13,140
person or insecure person

136
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:15,600
I just noticed their

137
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,600
energy that's like

138
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,370
really something that

139
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,370
I'm drawn to but

140
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:22,110
other than that would

141
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,110
be their smile if

142
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:24,150
they smile at me um

143
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,150
I noticed that what

144
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:27,920
is your zodiac sign

145
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,920
and do you believe

146
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:31,200
in astrology so my

147
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:31,200
son sign is Virgo

148
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:34,710
September 4th but

149
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:34,710
my moon sign is

150
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,380
Capricorn do I believe

151
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,380
in astrology so I

152
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:39,980
want to say no right

153
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,980
like the right

154
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:43,170
answers no I don't

155
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,170
believe in astrology

156
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:46,080
however I do kind of believe in

157
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:48,660
astrology because

158
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,660
there are a few signs

159
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,220
that I get along with

160
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,220
really well and a

161
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,440
few signs that I

162
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,440
don't get along with

163
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:54,150
really well so I

164
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,150
mean I think it's

165
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,980
interesting to look

166
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,980
into but I don't

167
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:59,310
think it's like an

168
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:59,310
end-all be-all like

169
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:00,960
definitely not

170
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,960
discounting a person

171
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:02,760
based on their sign

172
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,760
but I do normally

173
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:06,750
ask people when I

174
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:06,750
meet them like what's

175
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:10,170
your sign and it

176
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:10,170
will remind me about

177
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:14,250
them so order like

178
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,250
remind me of other

179
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:17,790
people like them do

180
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,790
I have any siblings

181
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:21,510
so yes I have two

182
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:21,510
sisters I'm one older

183
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:24,750
sister who is 34 and

184
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,750
a younger sister

185
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:25,450
who is 20 about to

186
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,450
be 21 she thinks

187
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:29,170
she's grown

188
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:33,130
she's not how tall are you

189
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:37,780
I am five five

190
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,780
what's your favorite

191
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:40,930
drink so it's the

192
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,930
same alcoholic or

193
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:43,290
non-alcoholic so

194
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,290
non-alcoholic is water

195
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:45,580
I don't drink anything

196
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,580
but water like

197
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:48,190
occasionally I'll

198
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:48,190
drink a sweet tea or

199
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:52,090

00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,440

226
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,150

227
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:34,150

nickname live like

231
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,190

232
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:43,300
up naming my daughter Olivia

233
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:45,490

a son's name I

236
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,590
really like the name

237
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:49,570

00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,570
King David it's my

239
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:52,030
favorite character

240
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,030

247
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,220

00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,880
number two really

397
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:43,150
reminds me of new york

398
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,150
i need how much i

399
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:45,820
love new york um then barcelona

400
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:47,980
I mean Barcelona was

401
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,980
amazing as well it

402
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:50,590
was like the highlight

403
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,590
of my European

404
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:53,440
vacation and then

405
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,440
laughs would be Paris

406
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:55,600
Paris was beautiful

407
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,600
literally the most

408
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:59,440
beautiful place I've

409
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:59,440
ever been like the

410
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:01,720
Eiffel Tower is

411
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,720
breathtaking but I

412
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,920
really didn't like

413
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:02,920
the culture and I

414
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,840
mean I don't speak French

415
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:07,690
I tried I learned

416
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:07,690
like a little bit of

417
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:10,140
French to get around

418
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,140
but I don't know

419
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:13,690
Paris would be at the

420
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:13,690
bottom of my list

421
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:15,370
places I want to go

422
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,370
Italy Mexia I want

423
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:19,240
to go to pretty much

424
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,240
like all the major

425
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:20,710
cities in Italy

426
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,710
Toronto Canada um I

427
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,880
would think those

428
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,880
are the two biggest

429
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:30,310
like international

430
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:30,310
trips on my radar for

431
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:32,800
now can I sing no I

432
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,800
cannot sing everyone

433
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:35,710
literally always

434
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:35,710
asked me like can I

435
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,870
sing and the answer

436
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,870
is no I'm a horrible

437
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:41,830
singer I did not get

438
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,830
that trait passed

439
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:44,470
down to me do you

440
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,470
have any allergies so

441
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:48,400
when I was a kid um

442
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:48,400
I had a really bad

443
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:50,560
allergic reaction

444
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,560
to an avocado so

445
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:53,410
basically they told

446
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,410
me I was allergic to

447
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,900
avocados welcome only

448
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,900
like anything with

449
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:57,440
avocado in it and so

450
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,440
I basically spent

451
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:59,540
my whole life up until

452
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,879
like avoiding avocados avoiding

453
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:04,370
guacamole Mexican

454
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:04,370
food is my favorite

455
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:06,800
food so you know

456
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,800
that's hard right like

457
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:10,040
all the time I go to

458
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:10,040
Mexican restaurants

459
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,459
and they're like um

460
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:10,459
walk and I'm like

461
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,759
nope

462
00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:16,790
can't have it so earlier

463
00:11:13,749 --> 00:11:16,790
this year I was

464
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:17,269
just like you know

465
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,269
what like I'm older

466
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:19,220
now

467
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:22,129
like I'm not a kid

468
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:22,129
but I want to try

469
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:24,800
cuacamole like let's

470
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:24,800

471
00:11:22,129 --> 00:11:27,769
still I like to Cafe

472
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:27,769
Rio and I got like

473
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,180
a guacamole on the

474
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:29,180
side and I was just

475
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:32,689
gonna eat a little

476
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:32,689
bit and see my

477
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:34,550
reaction but it was

478
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:34,550
so good that I

479
00:11:32,689 --> 00:11:36,259
literally like ate

480
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,259
way more than I

481
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:38,540
should have and I was

482
00:11:36,249 --> 00:11:38,540
nervous like I'm

483
00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:41,560
better go to laugh

484
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:41,560
at all like I'm back

485
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:45,110
I'm about to take

486
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:45,110
like 20 benadryl

487
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:47,629
luckily nothing

488
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,629
happened so I'm just

489
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:49,579
like okay baby my

490
00:11:47,619 --> 00:11:49,579
theory is right so I

491
00:11:47,629 --> 00:11:52,069
just kept slowly

492
00:11:49,569 --> 00:11:52,069
eating guacamole

493
00:11:49,579 --> 00:11:54,529

I totally see the

496
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:57,319
hype I love guacamole

497
00:11:54,529 --> 00:12:00,199

498
00:11:57,309 --> 00:12:00,199
on my bowl I will

499
00:11:57,319 --> 00:12:04,399
pay the extra $2 I

500
00:12:00,189 --> 00:12:04,399
think it's cuz I've

501
00:12:00,199 --> 00:12:05,689
been deprived all

502
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:05,689
these years um what

503
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,199
kind of car do you drive

504
00:12:05,689 --> 00:12:10,670
I Drive a Ford Focus

505
00:12:09,189 --> 00:12:10,670
I'm nothing crazy

506
00:12:09,199 --> 00:12:13,160
but I feel like it matches my

507
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:15,230
personality on a scale

508
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,230
of 1 to 10 with

509
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,120
10 being the highest

510
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,120
one being the

511
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:20,060
lowest what would you

512
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:20,060
rate your driving

513
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,459
skills I would rate

514
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:22,459
me like a three

515
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:24,110
people always say I'm

516
00:12:22,449 --> 00:12:24,110
a horrible driver

517
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:26,839
you're like my friends

518
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,839

519
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:29,000
okay I'll Drive like

520
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,000
cuz they don't want

521
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:31,610
to be in the car with

522
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:31,610
me but I feel like

523
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,709
over time especially

524
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,709
with me commuting

525
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:35,839
for work I've really

526
00:12:33,699 --> 00:12:35,839
become a better

527
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:37,610
driver but I'm still

528
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:37,610
not gonna write

529
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,230
myself that high

530
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,230
like you still might

531
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:41,320
not want to

532
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:44,020
in the car with me

533
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:44,020

534
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:48,520
for your last birthday

535
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:48,520

00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,170
like a birthday trip

594
00:13:56,590 --> 00:14:01,270
I was going for something

595
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,270
else so it was

596
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:03,820
probably one of the

597
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,820
most lucky birthdays

598
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:04,330
I've had in a while

599
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:04,330
but I really enjoyed

600
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,480
it

601
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:09,790
so 24 I'm definitely

602
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,790
gonna make sure I'm

603
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,200
doing something

604
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,200
more on my actual

605
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:16,920
birthday that's a

606
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:16,920
little more dramatic

607
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:20,800
because that's how I

608
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:20,800
am um but even uh

609
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:23,140
like 23 I did go to

610
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:23,140
the dr and august

611
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:26,380
and that to me was

612
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:26,380
my birthday trip but

613
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:27,640
I went like because

614
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,640
of the dates and who

615
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:30,640
I was going with

616
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:30,640
like I went with my

617
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:32,950
family and my sister

618
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,950
she started school

619
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:35,770
like the middle of

620
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,770
August so she could

621
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:37,960
not go in September

622
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,960
so that's really the

623
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:40,720
reason I won't went

624
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:40,720
to the dr was for my

625
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:42,190
birthday but it wasn't

626
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,190
necessarily label

627
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,020
that's my birthday

628
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,020
celebration but

629
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:46,630
either way I'm blessed

630
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:46,630
I went to the dr

631
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:48,400
I went to Orlando like

632
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,400
not worried about

633
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:49,100
it had a group if

634
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,100
I won the lottery

635
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,070
right now

636
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:54,680
how would I spend it

637
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,680
so this is funny as

638
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:57,560
we all know the

639
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:57,560
Powerball or whatever

640
00:14:54,680 --> 00:15:01,520
it's called is well

641
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:01,520
surpassed a billion

642
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:03,170
dollars yes I bought

643
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,170
my ticket so one

644
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:05,570
thing is I only

645
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,570
bought one ticket

646
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:07,520
because they say like

647
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,520
for me to buy 10

648
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:09,590
tickets 20 tickets

649
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,590
it does not increase

650
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:12,170
your chances like it

651
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,170
does but it's such

652
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:13,430
a small increase that

653
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,430
it's not worth it

654
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:15,350
like if you're gonna

655
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,350
win you're gonna

656
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:17,150
win so I always just

657
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,150
buy one ticket for

658
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:20,420
two dollars because I

659
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:20,420
also don't believe

660
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:22,130
in throwing my money

661
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:22,130
away right but what

662
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:27,050
would I do if I won

663
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:27,050
the lottery right

664
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:28,910
now so first I would

665
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,910
put like about 100

666
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:31,340
million and like

667
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,340
some type of safe or

668
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:33,410
trust fund so like

669
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,410
below all of the

670
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:36,740
money I can like live

671
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,740
off that money for

672
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:38,840
the rest of my life

673
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,840
and then I would

674
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:40,790
like give my friends

675
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,790
and family money

676
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:43,520
like I would give

677
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:43,520
all my best friends

678
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:45,800
like a million dollars

679
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,800
to just spin I

680
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:48,260
would give my parents

681
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:48,260
like ten million I

682
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:51,770
would give my sister

683
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,770
like five million

684
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:53,150

million see how am I

686
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:55,070
trying to do the math

687
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,070
make sure I'm not

688
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:56,960
like losing all my

689
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,960
money but a billion

690
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:59,810
dollars is a lot of

691
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:59,810
money and the pot

692
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:02,930
just keeps growing then I would

693
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:05,150
definitely like stop

00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,150

698
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,930
to just blow money

699
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,560
they gotta set a

700
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,560

00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:14,300

blow in the lottery

731
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,800
right now how would

732
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,800
I spend it so this

733
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:58,350
is funny as

734
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:01,740
no the Powerball or

735
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:01,740
whatever it's called

736
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:05,579
is well surpassed a

737
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:05,579
billion dollars yes

738
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:07,319
I bought my ticket

739
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:07,319
so one thing is I

740
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:09,780
only bought one ticket

741
00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:09,780
because they say

742
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:11,670
like for me to buy 10

743
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:11,670
tickets 20 tickets

744
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:14,160
it does not increase

745
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:14,160
your chances like

746
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:15,929
it does but it's such

747
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,929
a small increase

748
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,520
that it's not worth

749
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,520
it like if you're

750
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:19,949
gonna win you're gonna

751
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,949
win so I always

752
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,420
just buy one ticket

753
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:21,420
for $2 because I

754
00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:22,709
also don't believe

755
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:22,709
in throwing my money

756
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:25,290
away right

757
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:28,439
but what would I do

758
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,439
buy one the lottery

759
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:31,620

760
00:17:28,429 --> 00:17:31,620
I would put like

761
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:34,440
about 100 million and

762
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:34,440

763
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:36,270

for the rest of my

768
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,090
life and then I would

to do the math make

782
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:58,530
sure I'm not like

783
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,240
losing all my money

784
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,240
but a billion

785
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:03,120
dollars is a lot of

786
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:03,120
money and the pot

787
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:06,240
just keeps growing then I would

788
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,460
definitely like stop

789
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:08,460
