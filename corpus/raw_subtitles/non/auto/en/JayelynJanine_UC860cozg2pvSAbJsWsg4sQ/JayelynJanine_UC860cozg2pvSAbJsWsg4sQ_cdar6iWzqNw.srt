13
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,779

videos like this

23
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:48,030
is because I have ran

here on YouTube I

47
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,650
don't think so but

48
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,110

51
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,000
going to do it but

52
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,500
before we even get

53
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:22,500
into that if you have

54
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,600

up now let's don't

59
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:32,280
I don't know I did

60
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:34,020
that it's not like

61
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,020
it's gonna have a

62
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,590
cool transition or

63
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:34,590
anything so question

64
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,600
number one

65
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:39,630
have you heard you

66
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:39,630
sound like a white

67
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,400
girl no I don't think

68
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,400
anyone has ever

69
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,960
told me that I sound

70
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:42,960
like a white girl

71
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,659
because I don't know

72
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,659
I feel like I have

73
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,890
a pretty deep voice

74
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:46,890
and if someone was

75
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:48,720
on the phone with me

76
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,720
I feel like they'll

77
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,939
be able to tell that

78
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,939
I am black however

79
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,500
when I was in middle

80
00:01:50,929 --> 00:01:52,500
school some of the

81
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:55,920
friends I used to

82
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:55,920
hang out with used to

83
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,719
call me Oreo for some

84
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,719
strange reason and

85
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,790
it definitely was not

86
00:01:57,709 --> 00:01:59,790
because I used to

87
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:02,189
act white I just

88
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,189
think it was because

89
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:05,250
they was real dirty

90
00:02:02,179 --> 00:02:05,250
and they want the

91
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:06,960
participating ratchet

92
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,960
get other stuff

93
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,429
and I was not about

94
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,429
that life so I think

95
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,750
that's why they call

96
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,750
me Oreo but not

97
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:10,880
necessarily because

98
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,880
I act do I just

99
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,460
because I didn't want to do that

100
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:15,590
stuff that they was

101
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,590
doing but now that

102
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:18,860
I'm grown I'm all

103
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,860
for it so you know

104
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:20,930
question number two

105
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:20,930
are you natural

106
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,880
relaxed or tech slacks

107
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:28,850
hmm I don't really

108
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:28,850
know what tech slacks

109
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:31,310
mean but I am natural

110
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,310
when did you big

111
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:33,320
chop so I've actually

112
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,320
never got the big

113
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:36,620
chop I just started

114
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:36,620
transitioning I want

115
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:38,450
to say and fall like

116
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,450
2013 I just started

117
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:40,400
transitioning so yeah

118
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,400
and then over time

119
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:42,110
I kind of went through

120
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,110
and just like cut

121
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,370
pieces off but I never

122
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,370
officially like

123
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:48,740
we went to the place

124
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,740
I'm I got my hair

125
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:52,280
cut off but I honestly

126
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,280
need to because

127
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:58,610
it is not doing so

128
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:58,610
well what is the one

129
00:02:52,280 --> 00:03:00,950
thing that you like

130
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,950
about your hair okay

131
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:03,440
I'm just kidding no

132
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,440
I really do like my

133
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:06,440
hair um I feel like

134
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:06,440
I'm learning how to

135
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,450
love it and appreciate

136
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,450
it just because

137
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,220
for the longest

138
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,220
time like I used to

139
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:13,010
always wear weave in

140
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:13,010
my head I mean like

141
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:16,640
I started wearing

142
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,640
weave at a very young

143
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:18,920
age like a very

144
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,920
very young age so I

145
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,040
think now that I'm

146
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:22,040
older like I'm

147
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,720
starting to appreciate

148
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,720
it more and I'm

149
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,950
starting to wear it

150
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,950
out more like this

151
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,970
right here even

152
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,970
though technically I

153
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,860
have on a ponytail

154
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:29,270
this right here is

155
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,270
big for me because I

156
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,000
never used to do this

157
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,000
like when I was in

158
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:33,260
high school in

159
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,260
college like I never

160
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,180
would've worn my

161
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,180
hair like this so I

162
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:38,780
think I'm learning

163
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:38,780
how to appreciate it

164
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:41,690
more and then honestly

165
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,690
I feel like with

166
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:43,400
my hair I feel like

167
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,400
if I truly took care

168
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:45,680
of it like the way

169
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,680
I'm supposed to it

170
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,900
will be just fine

171
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,900
but because I don't

172
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,120
what happens is I

173
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,120
start to take care of

174
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,440
it and then I get

175
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,440
really lazy and I go

176
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,910
back to wigs and stuff

177
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,910
like that and I

178
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,890
kind of like mess it

179
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,890
up all over again

180
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:57,290
it's like this face

181
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,290
like I keep doing it

182
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:59,060
but I know for a fact

183
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,060
that if I actually

184
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:01,160
take care of it and

185
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:01,160
like put the right

186
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,720
products in it and

187
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,720
like do things that

188
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:05,300
I'm supposed to do

189
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,300
that my hair will be

190
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,840
just fine but I just

191
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,840
have a problem with

192
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:11,510
consistency what

193
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,510
don't you like about

194
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,550
your hair every thing I know I

195
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:16,940
do I like my hair but

196
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,940
what I don't like

197
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:18,470
about it is um it's

198
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,470
just difficult to

199
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,120
work with like sometimes I get

200
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:22,220
frustrated when I

201
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:22,220
see videos on like

202
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,130
natural hair especially

203
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,130
for women with

204
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,780
my textured hair

205
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,190
like you can't do this

206
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,190
you can't do that

207
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,870
you can't do this

208
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,870
you can't I'm like

209
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:30,360
that what's the point

210
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,360
of having hair

211
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:31,320
like what is the

212
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,320
point of having hair

213
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,840
you can't touch it

214
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:40,110
what black celebrity

215
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:40,110
do people say you

216
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:42,180
look like okay I have

217
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,180
been told numerous

218
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:44,160
times and I know

219
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:44,160
y'all gonna be like

220
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:46,890
what the cuz I do not see it and

221
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,960
trust me I do not

222
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,960
see it either but I

223
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:50,610
have been told

224
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,610
numerous times I would

225
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,470
say about like three

226
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,470
or four times in my

227
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:55,260
life that I look

228
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,260
like Teyana Taylor

229
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:56,850
which is so weird

230
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,850
because first of all I

231
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:58,980
think she honest

232
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,980
Taylor is beautiful

233
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:01,290
like she's gorgeous

234
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,290
so yes that is a

235
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:03,260
compliment to me but

236
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,260
I do not see it

237
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:07,620
like I do not think

238
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,620
I look like her at

239
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:09,990
all like I don't like

240
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,990
we literally look

241
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,850
nothing alike but

242
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,850
I've been told I look

243
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:14,880
like Teyana Taylor

244
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,880
and I think she is

245
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:16,410
gorgeous and then

246
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,410
recently someone told

247
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,710
me I look like Nia

248
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,710
Long which I'll also

249
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:22,470
take but those are

250
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,470
the only two that I

251
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:27,300
can think of at the

252
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:27,300
moment um did you go

253
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:30,570
to a predominately

254
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:30,570
white or black school

255
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:32,280
I went to a black

256
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,280
and Hispanic school

257
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:34,170
okay straight up

258
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,170
black straight up

259
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,000
Hispanic that's it

260
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,000
I could literally

261
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:39,450
count the amount of

262
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:39,450
white people that

263
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,730
went to my skin I

264
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,730
know y'all see that

265
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:44,400
Ash

266
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:46,710
really Wow okay I

267
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,710
can literally count

268
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,290
the amount of white

269
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,290
people that went to

270
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:51,480
my school on like one

271
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,480
hand it also had a

272
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:53,460
bunch of like Asian

273
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,460
people too but if I

274
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,200
had to pick like a

275
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,200
number it was for

276
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,850
sure black Hispanic

277
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,850
mess and they're

278
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,760
like Asian it was

279
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,760
pretty it's pretty

280
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:01,260
diverse this I mean

281
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,260
despite not having

282
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,870
white people but other

283
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,870
than that it was

284
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:09,420
pretty diverse what

285
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:09,420
is your favorite

286
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:12,480
thing about being black

287
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,480
oh honey I don't

288
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:14,520
even know I don't it's

289
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,520
just like it just

290
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,960
feels good like I

291
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,960
can't explain it I

292
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,220
feel like if you black then he'd

293
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,200
probably know exactly

294
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,200
what I'm talking

295
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,630
about but it just feels

296
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,630
good like I just

297
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,580
feel like we are the

298
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,580
culture that most

299
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:25,170
people I try to emulate

300
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:25,170
and things like

301
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,850
that you don't have

302
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,850
to grew me but

303
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:28,980
that's just my

304
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,980
personal opinion like

305
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:31,440
it's like could you

306
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:31,440
imagine what life

307
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:34,510
would be like without

308
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:34,510
black people could

309
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:39,250
you imagine what

310
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:39,250
life would be like

311
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:40,660
without black women

312
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,660
I can't so I don't

313
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:43,060
know I just love me

314
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,060
and black it's just

315
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:45,250
it's amazing it's

316
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,250
empowering and just

317
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:47,260
just to look at like

318
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,260
our history and

319
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:49,390
like where we are now

320
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,390
and where we are

321
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:52,120
going like it's just

322
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,120
insane like I just

323
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:53,710
feel like in my

324
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,710
opinion again like I

325
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,810
know a lot of people

326
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,810
may not agree but I

327
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:57,850
feel like the black

328
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,850
race or like the

329
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:59,410
african-american race

330
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,410
is just it's just

331
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:03,190
progressing like

332
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,190
it's just getting

333
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:06,910
better and better

334
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,910
and honey you can't

335
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:09,280

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:19,330
yes they do have you

340
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:19,330
ever dated a white

341
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:22,210
guy I've never like

342
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,210
dated a white guy

343
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:24,400
well okay how about

344
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,400
this I was never in

345
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:28,030
a serious relationship

346
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:28,030
with a white guy

347
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:30,370
but I did go on a few

348
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,370
dates with one guy

349
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:32,620
who was white and you

350
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,620
know it was cool

351
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:34,120
he was cool or

352
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,120
whatever he was like a

353
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:36,010
different type of

354
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:36,010
white guy though for

355
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,380
sure like well then

356
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,380
again what does that

357
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:41,320
even mean I don't

358
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:41,320
even know but he was

359
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:42,850
cool he was cool he

360
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,850
was I you know it is

361
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:46,630
what it is we never

362
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,630
like to get anywhere

363
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:47,680
but he was cool have

364
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,680
you ever heard is

365
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:50,680
that your real hair

366
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,540
if so win yes I've

367
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,540
heard that multiple

368
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,070
times I would say

369
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,070
though I used to hear

370
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,630
that a lot when I was

371
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,630
younger like when

372
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:57,970
I was in school and

373
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,970
stuff like that

374
00:07:55,630 --> 00:08:00,130
people would act like

375
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,130
is that your real

376
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:02,650
hair and stuff like

377
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,650
that but I feel like

378
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:04,030
nowadays I don't hear

379
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,030
it often at all I

380
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:07,180
should I don't really

381
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,180
hear it at all I

382
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:09,130
think it's mainly

383
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,130
just because where we

384
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:10,510
have come like in our

385
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,510
culture wise and

386
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:12,250
meaning like I just

387
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,250
feel like everyone

388
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:14,470
knows about weave

389
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,470
and extensions and

390
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:16,750
stuff like that you

391
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,750
know back in the day

392
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:18,430
it was kind of like

393
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,430
hush hush like who

394
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,650
she got on the wig

395
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,650
or she got on weed

396
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:23,620
stuff like that now

397
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,620
everybody do it not

398
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:25,540
just black people

399
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,540
white women Hispanic

400
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:27,820
women Asian women

401
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,820
like everyone kind of

402
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:29,290
has extensions and

403
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,290
stuff like that so I

404
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:31,690
feel like at this

405
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,690
point it doesn't even

406
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:33,550
matter because like I

407
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,550
feel like a lot of

408
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:35,500
people don't even

409
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,500
really where they're

410
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:38,050
like full hair anymore

411
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,050
or their real

412
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:42,490
hair or at least like

413
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:42,490
all of it be their

414
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:44,050
real hair but so yeah

415
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,050
I used to hear it

416
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:46,390
a lot when I was younger

417
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,390
like when I was

418
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:46,880
in school but now that

419
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:46,880
I'm older I don't

420
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:51,140
really hear

421
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:54,560
opting box braids

422
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,560
or twist definitely

423
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:57,170
twist I look so stupid

424
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:57,170
with braids in my

425
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,940
head like I cannot

426
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,940
wear braids like to

427
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:00,800
the back you're not

428
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,800
some girls be having

429
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:02,240
those like braid

430
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,240
designs and they're so

431
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,380
cute it's like to the

432
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,380
back of their head

433
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,500
they're kind of

434
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:05,500
like cornrows but

435
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:08,240
they're like long and

436
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,240
stuff like that I

437
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:12,050
cannot wear those

438
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:12,050
hairstyles like I look

439
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,850
so ugly with my hair

440
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,850
like all the way to

441
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:15,110
the back like right

442
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,110
now you're probably

443
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:16,820
thinking like your

444
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,820
hair is to the back

445
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:18,170
now but technically

446
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:18,170
I got I kind of got

447
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,670
something like in

448
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,670
my face and then

449
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:22,040
there's also this

450
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,040
hair in the back that

451
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:26,480
kind of takes away

452
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:26,480
from it but like

453
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:28,760
y'all like if I just

454
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,760
like like I look so

455
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,190
bad with my hair

456
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,190
straight to the back so

457
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:33,320
I can't wear that

458
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,320
side 100% preferred

459
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:38,050
twist when do you

460
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:38,050

461
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:38,050
around family friends

462
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:45,440
would say we'd walk

463
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:45,440
through the blackest

464
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:48,740

with like who you

522
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:08,830

it in my head right

548
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:45,980
now as much as I

549
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,980
wish this was my

550
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:48,260
ponytail it is not

551
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:48,260
and I do wear wigs

552
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:50,600
and stuff like that

553
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,600
were you always

554
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:52,850
confident in wearing

555
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,850
your hat short milk

556
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:55,370
where are you

557
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,370
always confident in

558
00:11:52,850 --> 00:12:00,530
wearing your natural

559
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,530
hair no I was not

560
00:11:55,370 --> 00:12:02,180
and honestly I it

561
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,180
kind of changes there

562
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:03,320
are moments when I

563
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,320
am very confident

564
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:05,570
with wearing it and

565
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,570
then there are

566
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,160
moments when I'm not

567
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,160
it really just it

568
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:10,460
depends on where I'm

569
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:10,460
going and then just

570
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,900
like how it is in

571
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:11,900
general like again

572
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:13,580
like I've actually

573
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,580
take care of my hair

574
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,620
because I've done

575
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,620
it in the past when

576
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:17,210
I've actually took

577
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,210
taken care of my

578
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:20,060
natural hair and I

579
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,060
will wear like an

580
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:22,040
acute like twist out

581
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:22,040
with like I don't

582
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:23,810
know it just depends

583
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,810
but no I haven't

584
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:26,000
always been confident

585
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,000
and wearing it and

586
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:27,710
I'm still not 100%

587
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,710
confident in wearing

588
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,440
it it's gonna take

589
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,440
some time but I know

590
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:34,220
that more I wear the

591
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:34,220
more I learn about

592
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:37,100
it it'll be all

593
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:37,100
good what is your

594
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:40,190
favorite hair brand

595
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,190
ooh that is actually

596
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:42,410
a difficult question

597
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,410
okay so okay no

598
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:45,980
boom if we're talking

599
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,980
about in terms of

600
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:47,930
like weave like

601
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,930
bundles my favorite

602
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:49,610
hammering is she's

603
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,610
happy hair and I know

604
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:50,960
I'm gonna get a lot

605
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,960
of crap for that

606
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:53,420
because I know a

607
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,420
lot of people hate

608
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:55,820
she's happy hair but

609
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,820
that hair is so

610
00:12:53,420 --> 00:13:00,410
good like you have

611
00:12:55,810 --> 00:13:00,410
no idea I made a wig

612
00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:02,480
and 2017 I still have

613
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,480
that wig today now

614
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:04,610
I will say I do need

615
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,610
to switch out the

616
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,080
closure because the

617
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,080
closure is balding

618
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:09,750
but the hair itself is still

619
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:12,660
like she's happy

620
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,660
hair is really good

621
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:16,410
hair I love it I know

622
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:16,410
some people don't

623
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:18,149
like it but I like it

624
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,149
how deep is it for

625
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:20,550
you to let someone

626
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:20,550
see you in your

627
00:13:18,149 --> 00:13:21,959
headscarf it is a big

628
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,959
deal and I don't

629
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,250
think any of the guys

630
00:13:21,949 --> 00:13:23,250
I've ever talked

631
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:28,050
to in my life have seen me in a

632
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:29,970
headscarf I'm on

633
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,970
maybe one but it's a

634
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:31,589
big deal like if you

635
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,589
see me in my bun to

636
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:34,800
my what does it call my Bonnie

637
00:13:31,589 --> 00:13:36,269
oh you you're close

638
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,269
we're close two more

639
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,209
questions and then

640
00:13:36,259 --> 00:13:38,209
we are going to be

641
00:13:36,269 --> 00:13:41,430
done

642
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:44,160
what black woman do

643
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,160
you relate to the

644
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:48,930
most fiction or

645
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:48,930
nonfiction like Olivia

646
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:50,850
Pope Oh Laverne Cox

647
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,850
Solange um what

648
00:13:48,930 --> 00:14:00,149
black woman do you

649
00:13:50,840 --> 00:14:00,149
relate to the most

650
00:13:50,850 --> 00:14:04,769
oh who do I relate

651
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:04,769
to fiction they

652
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:07,890
definitely don't know

653
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:07,890
I feel like I feel

654
00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:09,570
like okay so nonfiction

655
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,570
wise I feel like

656
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:11,610
there was a black

657
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,610
like Celebi that I

658
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:13,680
would say I relate to

659
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,680
what probably have

660
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:15,870
to be like Issa Rae

661
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,870
I don't know I just

662
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,640
feel like she keeps

663
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,640
it real and a lot of

664
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:19,860
the stuff she's like

665
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,860
voicing I feel like

666
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:22,500
a lot of black women

667
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:22,500
go through I don't

668
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:24,329
know like I would say

669
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:24,329
Issa rate and then

670
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:28,950
as far as like nonfiction

671
00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:30,810
I don't really relate

672
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,810
to this person but

673
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:34,410
I'm obsessed with

674
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,410
like annalise keating

675
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:36,180
which is Viola Davis

676
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,180
character on how to

677
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:38,940
get away with murder

678
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:38,940
but to be fair I'm

679
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:40,829
also obsessed like

680
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,829
Olivia Pope too but I

681
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:42,870
don't know like I

682
00:14:40,819 --> 00:14:42,870
just liked their

683
00:14:40,829 --> 00:14:45,149
characters I feel

684
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,149
like I feel like

685
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:46,709
actually you know what

686
00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:46,709
I can't relate to

687
00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:48,570
Anneliese kidding

688
00:14:46,699 --> 00:14:48,570
because on that show

689
00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:51,630
she was like a slight

690
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,630
actually she was

691
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:54,390
alcoholic at man I'm

692
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,390
not alcoholic boo

693
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:56,490
and like be rough

694
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,490
y'all straight vodka

695
00:14:54,390 --> 00:15:01,680
does not sound like a bad idea

696
00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:04,470
okay okay last

697
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:04,470
question okay last

698
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:07,410
question and we're

699
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:07,410
doing name four black

700
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:12,060
classic movies that

701
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:12,060
you have or haven't

702
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:14,790
seen okay so my first

703
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,790
classic movie that

704
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:17,699
I've loved and set it

705
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,699
off oh I love that

706
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:19,180
movie so much the

707
00:15:17,689 --> 00:15:19,180
second one would ever

708
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:22,450
have to be poetic justice we

709
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:25,270
Janet Jackson if Tupac

710
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,270
if his fine stuff

711
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:27,280
and then as third

712
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,280
one I don't know I

713
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:29,230
really do like loving basketball

714
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:31,180
although I've seen

715
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,180
that movie so many

716
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:33,130
times that if you put

717
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:33,130
it on the TV right

718
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:37,090
now I would probably

719
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,090
throw something at

720
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:41,640
it now there is two

721
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:41,640
black movies that I

722
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:46,090
have not seen and

723
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:46,090
I am so ashamed

724
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:48,580
I'm so ashamed but

725
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,580
I'm just gonna say

726
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:50,770
them okay I have not

727
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,770
seen a menace to

728
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:55,240
society all the way

729
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:55,240
through like I've

730
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:57,550
only seen bits and

731
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,550
pieces of it and yeah

732
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,900
so I've never seen

733
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,900
like ministers

734
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:00,670
society all the

735
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,670
way through and I

736
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:02,440
actually want to see

737
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,440
that movie but no

738
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:04,660
one has it like Netflix

739
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,660
doesn't have it

740
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:08,950
Hulu and I'm not

741
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:08,950
trying to put any more

742
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:12,070
viruses on this computer

743
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:12,070
so I don't know

744
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:16,480
but mr. society and

745
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:16,480
then I've never seen

746
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:20,500
belly I know right

747
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:20,500
I've never seen belly

748
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:22,720
in my life I've never

749
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,720
seen it and I want

750
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:25,150
to but I just haven't

751
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:25,150
had the chance to

752
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,770
so those are my two

753
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,770
like black movies

754
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:29,290
that I need to see

755
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,290
that everyone has

756
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:31,060
like seen and loved

757
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,060
better than that I

758
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:33,790
think I'm good but

759
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:33,790
that is going to be

760
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:35,950
all for this video

761
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,950
