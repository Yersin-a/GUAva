1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,259
I would meet people

21
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,719
a little bit different

22
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:39,719
from you know

23
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,360

00:00:39,709 --> 00:00:42,360
to put up on my

25
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:45,329
channel and I guess

26
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,329
it's a little bit

27
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:52,879
more serious today today's video

28
00:00:45,329 --> 00:01:01,289

29
00:00:52,869 --> 00:01:01,289
like genetics DNA

30
00:00:52,879 --> 00:01:04,260
heritage culture etc

31
00:01:01,279 --> 00:01:04,260
so um let me gotta

32
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:07,530
run down so maybe

33
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,530
about a year ago my

34
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,720
principal was sick

35
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,720
and I was will see

36
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:13,740
her in the hospital

37
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:13,740
and while I was

38
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:17,220
there I was telling

39
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:17,220
her somehow someway

40
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:20,070
her and her brother

41
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,070
we got on the topic

42
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,750
of culture and stuff

43
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,750
like that and I was

44
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:25,080
just telling her like

45
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:25,080
I always wanted to

46
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:27,840
know where I was

47
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,840
from yada yada yada

48
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,939
so fast forward a

49
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,939
couple weeks later

50
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,890
when she got better

51
00:01:29,929 --> 00:01:31,890
she asked me for my

52
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:35,640
address and suffered

53
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,640
ah and she was like

54
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:39,150
I'm gonna send you

55
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:39,150
again and she sent it

56
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:42,150
to me and it ended

57
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,150
up being a 23andme

58
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:47,670
now like I said this

59
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:47,670
this was a while

60
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:49,920
ago so I got the

61
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,920
package and I just

62
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:53,390
never open everyone

63
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:53,390
in time she send it

64
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,880
sent it I was in the

65
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,880
process of moving

66
00:01:53,390 --> 00:02:00,530
etc etc and after

67
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:00,530
that that wasn't like

68
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,530
January when she sent it

69
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:07,409
no January yeah it

70
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:07,409
was January so it

71
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:11,250
wasn't even a year

72
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:11,250
ago almost here

73
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:13,090
cuz it's it's November

74
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,090
now but yeah I

75
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:16,330
didn't take it I let it say

76
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:20,980
say let it sit and

77
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,980
finally a few months

78
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:24,040
ago I think in September

79
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,040
I finally was

80
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:27,730
like okay let me go

81
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,730
ahead and let me

82
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:29,140
take that 23 me and

83
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,140
I'm also glad that I

84
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,910
waited too because

85
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:30,910
if I would have took

86
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:37,060
it as soon as she

87
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:37,060
gave it to me as

88
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:41,140
possible that I wouldn't

89
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:41,140
I wouldn't have

90
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:42,250
God and I was like

91
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,250
as detail you know

92
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:45,940
our description

93
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,940
of where I'm from

94
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:54,370

00:02:45,940 --> 00:03:01,720
their system so and

97
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:01,720
about I registered

my kid i'ma say well

99
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,580

101
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:08,410
register my kid

102
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,410

you know I do all

104
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,260

00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:13,260
spent in the to viral

106
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:19,060
and around that time

107
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,060

00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,190
sender like to one

109
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,190

around that time I was

111
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,200
like in September

112
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:25,359
I think that they were

113
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,359
going to flood in

114
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:31,049

117
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:33,489

00:03:57,449 --> 00:03:59,560
2nd 2018 my reports

131
00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:02,290
were ready and I've

132
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:02,290
watched a ton of

133
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:05,170
other videos of people

134
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,170
saying oh it took

135
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:07,450
like four to five weeks

136
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,450
I arrived with a

137
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:10,810
little time as y'all

138
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,810
can see this was

139
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:13,540
not a long time at

140
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,540
all for me at least

141
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,859
it was like Nene ready

142
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,859
already so let me

143
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,919
get it a little bit

144
00:04:14,849 --> 00:04:16,919
into the background

145
00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:19,539
right now family

146
00:04:16,909 --> 00:04:19,539
history whatever um

147
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:21,159
honestly I've never

148
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:21,159
had the culture or

149
00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:24,520
like whether for

150
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:24,520
mom talk from my

151
00:04:21,159 --> 00:04:27,669
parents or anyone in

152
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,669
my family I don't

153
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:29,400
I think that they

154
00:04:27,659 --> 00:04:29,400
care about stuff like

155
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:31,990
that I think I'm the

156
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,990
only one because

157
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,930
you know they've

158
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,930
never talked about

159
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:37,629
culture and my mom

160
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,629
she's a little ignant

161
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:39,849
so I don't think if I

162
00:04:37,619 --> 00:04:39,849
were actually like

163
00:04:37,629 --> 00:04:43,440
your mom do you know

164
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:43,440
I don't think she

165
00:04:39,849 --> 00:04:45,849
no we just grew up as being

166
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,610
african-american I

167
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:48,610
was being black and

168
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:51,250
that's always what

169
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,250
it was you wanna say

170
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:56,849
everybody my family

171
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,849
or from the Upstate

172
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:59,770
regions of New York

173
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:59,770
grew up here most

174
00:04:56,849 --> 00:05:03,970
grew up here most of

175
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,970
the time in my life

176
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:06,039
and I did live in

177
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,039
Georgia for a very

178
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:08,380
small portion of my

179
00:05:06,029 --> 00:05:08,380
life but we moved it

180
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:11,409
is because my mom got

181
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:11,409
married we do not

182
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:13,150
have any family down

183
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:13,150
there or nothing so

184
00:05:11,409 --> 00:05:14,919
I don't have anybody

185
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,919
no ties to Georgia

186
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:17,590
most of my family

187
00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:17,590
it's an upstate New

188
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:20,469
York in this region

189
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,469
so yeah that's it

190
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:22,449
and as for my father

191
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:22,449
my father know much

192
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:23,919
about where we came

193
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:23,919
from he I don't

194
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:26,349
think he's interested

195
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:26,349
in culture anyway

196
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:30,669
he's never you know had that

197
00:05:26,349 --> 00:05:32,590
conversation with me

198
00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:32,590
and I honestly to

199
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:35,080
me to be completely

200
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,080
honest I never

201
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:37,330
really thought about

202
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,330
where I was from

203
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:41,469
and stuff like that

204
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:41,469
until I got to

205
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:43,360
college now like I

206
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:43,360
said I am from New

207
00:05:41,469 --> 00:05:44,979
York but I'm not from

208
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,979
New York City from

209
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,580
those of you who are

210
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:48,580
not from New York

211
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:50,650
State I'm from upstate

212
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,650
New York so when

213
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:53,469
I went to college

214
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,469
it was just like a

215
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:56,849
culture shock even

216
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:56,849
though I'm black I

217
00:05:53,469 --> 00:06:00,130
did I do go to a PWI

218
00:05:56,839 --> 00:06:00,130
predominantly white

219
00:05:56,849 --> 00:06:02,949
institution but the

220
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,949
percentage of black

221
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:05,800
people at my school

222
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:05,800
is you know pretty

223
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:08,529
eyes pretty good or

224
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:08,529
whatever for the

225
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:13,419
most part for it being

226
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:13,419
a PWI and upstate

227
00:06:08,529 --> 00:06:15,460
New York um and when

228
00:06:13,409 --> 00:06:15,460
I got there you

229
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:17,919
know I was meeting

230
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,919
people I left on

231
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:20,139
campus and I would

232
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:20,139
meet people and they

233
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,409
would be like yo I'm

234
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,409
dis this and now

235
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:26,199
what are you and I'll

236
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:26,199
be like I'm black

237
00:06:22,409 --> 00:06:29,940
and like ya know but

238
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:29,940

no what are you

242
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:41,940
and that's when I

243
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:41,940
really started the

244
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:44,100
question like Oh am

245
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,100
I where am i firm

246
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:46,470
because I would see

247
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:46,470
people like it would

248
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,540
be Nigerian it would

249
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,540
be from Ghana I

250
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:50,700
have a friend who's

251
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:50,700
I think she's cubed

252
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:53,280
a lot of Jamaicans

253
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,280
there a lot of

254
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:55,770
Dominicans at my

255
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,770
school so it's just

256
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,590
like and they are

257
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,590
in those two their

258
00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:00,240
culture and a lot

259
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,240
of people my school

260
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:02,430
are from New York

261
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,430
City in the downstate

262
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,310
area you know the

263
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,310
five boroughs Browns

264
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:07,980
Brooklyn Queens blah

265
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,980
blah blah blah so

266
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:10,560
down there you know

267
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,560
it's very culture

268
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:13,020
based and New York

269
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:13,020
City it's completely

270
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,000
different from upstate

271
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,000
New York so once

272
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:18,570
I got to college I

273
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:18,570
was just like oh my

274
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,270
god like they got

275
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,270
the only food and I

276
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:24,870
think oh you know

277
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:24,870
they go to bed to do

278
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:26,670
this and on this chicken

279
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,670
a little chicky

280
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:29,670
the loser cuz I'm

281
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,670
just black like we

282
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:30,000
don't know like we

283
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,000
don't Jack nothing

284
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:32,400
else

285
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,160
I just always gonna

286
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:35,160
have you thinking

287
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:38,700
about it cuz my first

288
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:38,700
couple of years at

289
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:40,940
colleges really showed

290
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,940
me a line open up

291
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:43,620
my mind to so many

292
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:43,620
different things so

293
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:45,930
yeah ever since then

294
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,930
I've been wondering

295
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,580
like damn where am i

296
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,580
from or whatever so

297
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:51,300
I'm really grateful

298
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:51,300
that my principal

299
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:54,330
decided to go ahead

300
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:54,330
and buy me this kit

301
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:58,640
because lord knows I

302
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,640
didn't even really

303
00:07:54,330 --> 00:08:00,630
I didn't know party

304
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,630
and I never probably

305
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:05,010
would have found out

306
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:05,010
about it if she

307
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:07,560
didn't buy it for me

308
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,560
so yeah so before

309
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:09,000
prior to taking this

310
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,000
test I did look up

311
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,590
a few videos and I

312
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,590
noticed that they

313
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,110
gave me percentage

314
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,110
so I kind of like

315
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:14,580
predicted my own percentages I'm

316
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:18,960
probably and I was

317
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:18,960
like I'm probably

318
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:21,270
like 95 per second

319
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:21,270
five percent European

320
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,840
because you know

321
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,840
African American says

322
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:26,850
we come from that

323
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,850
dysphoria um you know

324
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,720
we always have a

325
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,720
little bit of African

326
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,730
in us I mean

327
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,490
European and then

328
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,490
dope guys working in

329
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:34,260
us um so yeah my

330
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,260
European percentage was

331
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:36,690
not high at all I did

332
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,690
not get anything

333
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:41,219
out of American

334
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:41,219
nothing Asian just

335
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:44,550
because like we never

336
00:08:41,209 --> 00:08:44,550
had that culture

337
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:47,720
talking my family

338
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,720
so that was really

339
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:47,720
just out of the

340
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:54,450
yes so as far as

341
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,450
what I thought I was

342
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:59,190
because I got this

343
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,190
mentioned before I

344
00:08:54,450 --> 00:09:02,400
was around a lot

345
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:02,400
of people from my

346
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:06,660
school who were African

347
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:06,660
like from Ghana

348
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:08,250
Nigeria most of the

349
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,250
people that I'm at

350
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:10,680
school are from there

351
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:13,990
so I predicted that

352
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:13,990
I was probably

353
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:15,710
either from Ghana

354
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,710
or Nigeria and um

355
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:18,570
[Music]

356
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:20,970
that's pretty much

357
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,970
a dad and guess

358
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:22,980
anywhere else just

359
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,980
because of the

360
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:24,780
dysphoria and you

361
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:24,780
know knowing that

362
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,250
history another thing

363
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,250
people from my

364
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:29,100
school is when I

365
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,100
would just tell them

366
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:32,310
I'm just black is

367
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:32,310
like they they they

368
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:34,860
forgot this whole 400

369
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,860
years in history

370
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:36,690
just went late for

371
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,690
my mom like they was

372
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:41,040
like really an old

373
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:41,040
that I didn't know

374
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:49,380
where I was from they

375
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:49,380
didn't mean me I'm

376
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:51,480
just like yeah my

377
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:51,480
bad job is really

378
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,130
interrupting but like

379
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,130
I was saying like

380
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,350
they will forget

381
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,350
that you know this

382
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:58,560
whole point in history

383
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:58,560
actually took

384
00:09:55,350 --> 00:10:01,170
place and there's

385
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:01,170
people in America that

386
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,760
are black that don't

387
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,760
know where they

388
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,630
come from in Africa I

389
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,630
haven't message at

390
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,760
my phone right now

391
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:08,880
from people that I've

392
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,880
talked to that I

393
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,650
know that they like

394
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,650
what do you mean and

395
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,210
it just at that point

396
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,210
it was kind of

397
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:14,370
getting aggravated

398
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,370

00:12:15,249 --> 00:12:22,049
I'm gonna read the

460
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:22,049
breakdown after that

461
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:25,829

say that a lot of

473
00:12:40,089 --> 00:12:46,119

476
00:12:46,109 --> 00:12:47,819
se I know I just

477
00:12:46,119 --> 00:12:50,649
slaughtered that

478
00:12:47,819 --> 00:12:52,389
southern East African

479
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,389
one points one

480
00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:54,549
point four percent African

481
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:58,959
hunter-gatherer

482
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:58,959
whatever that means

483
00:12:54,549 --> 00:13:03,279
1.4 percent sort

484
00:12:58,949 --> 00:13:03,279
of knees they're a

485
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:05,319
point one broadly West

486
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:05,319
African which was

487
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,489
would you mean that's

488
00:13:05,309 --> 00:13:06,489
why I got over

489
00:13:05,319 --> 00:13:08,649
this today I was

490
00:13:06,479 --> 00:13:08,649
trying to be like

491
00:13:06,489 --> 00:13:09,910
cultural even though

492
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:09,910
this is a low-key

493
00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:12,220
Jamaican colors

494
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:13,840
but you know Nigerian

495
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,840
flag is green and

496
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:16,000
white I try to give

497
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:16,000
y'all I try to give

498
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,470
a little hint okay

499
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,470
try to give y'all

500
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,420
over here it's green

501
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,420
and white but you

502
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:21,070
know the yellow had

503
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:21,070
to do because I

504
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:24,010
don't have anything

505
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:24,010
that's green white

506
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:28,360
and I like Jamaicans

507
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,360
anyway I go on okay

508
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:32,890
anyways so yeah that

509
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:32,890
mix up and then you

510
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:34,690
know 1.6% broadly

511
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,690
southern ease it just

512
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:38,100
makes up a whole

513
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,100
bunch of things and

514
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:42,510
broadly subsets

515
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:42,510
sub-saharan african 4.0

516
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:51,210
so if i'm ninety

517
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:51,210
point four percent

518
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:58,180
African how much my

519
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:58,180
European how much

520
00:13:51,210 --> 00:14:00,880
seven point eight

521
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,880
percent European I'll

522
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:03,640
take that and my

523
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,640
highest percentage for

524
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,470
being European was

525
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,470
Burley Northwestern

526
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:07,740
European three point two percent

527
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:10,210
British and Irish

528
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:10,210
one point three

529
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:16,200
Scandinavian one

530
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:16,200
point one French and

531
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:19,450
German 0.9 Burley

532
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:19,450
European one point for

533
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:22,840
this next one really

534
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,840
shocked me because

535
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:25,540
I never heard that

536
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:25,540
story growing up like

537
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:28,690
oh you're Native

538
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:28,690
American you're this

539
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:32,230
you're that never got

540
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,230
fed any of those

541
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:35,110
lies but according

542
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,110
to this my genetic

543
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:37,030
makeup East Asian and

544
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,030
Native American I

545
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:41,290
am one point three

546
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:41,290
percent a percentage

547
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:44,500
is very low but I'm

548
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,500
surprised that it

549
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:49,300
existed anyway it

550
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:49,300
says I'm Native

551
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:55,300
American one percent

552
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:55,300
that doesn't mean I

553
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:58,630
don't even excite

554
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:58,630
me like and I said

555
00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:01,900
drily north and

556
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,900
northern I using a

557
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:05,230
Native American 0.1%

558
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:05,230
Burley Chinese and

559
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:06,970
Southeast Asian 0.1%

560
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,970
so that makes up my

561
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:09,640
1.3 percent East

562
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,640
Asian and Native

563
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:15,000
American underside

564
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:15,000
and unassigned with

565
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:20,320
0.5 so yeah I was

566
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:20,320
extremely excited for

567
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,310
you know these results

568
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,310
but what I wanna

569
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,960
do is

570
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:25,960
you guys are interested

571
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:25,960
I kind of want

572
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:28,180
to take the ancestry

573
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:28,180
DNA one just

574
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:30,820
because I feel like

575
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:30,820
that one is a little

576
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:32,260
bit more accurate just

577
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,260
because they have

578
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:36,460
a broader arm

579
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:38,500
I guess genetic pool

580
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,500
to the tech exactly

581
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:42,880
where you're from

582
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:42,880
because the videos I

583
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:46,240
watched prior to me

584
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:46,240
getting my reports a

585
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:48,580
lot of people you

586
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,580
know that did this

587
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:52,360
with 23andme I would

588
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:52,360
just say that they

589
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:54,190
were sub-saharan

590
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,190
African that's it was

591
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,500
like three categories

592
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,500
and then they

593
