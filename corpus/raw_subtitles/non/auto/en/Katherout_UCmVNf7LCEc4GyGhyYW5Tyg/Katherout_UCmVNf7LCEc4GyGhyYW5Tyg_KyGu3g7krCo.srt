1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,800
are you guys ready for some piping hot

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,800
[ __ ] takes

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,080
[Music]

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,679
preemptively if you'd like to give me a

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,240
thumbs up for the amount i'm about to

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,760
over share

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,680
that would be much appreciated

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,480
ordinarily in my almost 10 years of

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,720
doing youtube

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,240
when i do any sort of q a those of you

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,119
following me on instagram will submit

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,279
the questions

13
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,119
i will scroll through i will audit for

14
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,760
the ones that seem the most relevant or

15
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,640
topical

16
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,280
timely there's a lot of bias going on in

17
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,920
here

18
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,120
there's a lot of custom selection but

19
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,280
today we're going to

20
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,640
wipe that all away and answer the

21
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,760
questions that i have

22
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,920
strategically avoided over

23
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,360
many many years i haven't even read

24
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,840
through any of these yet so you're gonna

25
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,239
get the raw and real reactions i wanted

26
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,199
no pre-meditation on any of these so

27
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,520
that you guys get

28
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,879
the the genuine [ __ ] only and we're

29
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,280
gonna start with the one that i was

30
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,680
expecting it's top of the pile

31
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,800
why did you and austin break up so it's

32
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,280
been two years

33
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,720
i will say i like definitely snuck the

34
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,720
announcement about the breakup

35
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,560
into a video that didn't really have it

36
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,680
in the title mainly because breakup

37
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,000
videos were like

38
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,119
very popular in that season of youtube

39
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,280
and i felt

40
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,400
really really icky about exploiting my

41
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,880
breakup for views

42
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,159
but right now i am circling the question

43
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,479
so let's just go right

44
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,680
in and just say that listen like we were

45
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,520
together for four years

46
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,119
i completely love that relationship

47
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,560
online with all of you so i totally

48
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,560
understand the curiosity

49
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,079
it like wasn't an amicable breakup so i

50
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,600
didn't feel super comfortable talking

51
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,320
about it online but

52
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,200
he was like my first serious

53
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,960
relationship

54
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,040
we were together for almost four years

55
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,920
and i think just tort it was a really

56
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,680
happy

57
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,240
lovely healthy relationship for most of

58
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,520
it just to clear up like there was no

59
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,520
toxic horrible huge blow up moment where

60
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,840
it ended there was none of that

61
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,000
it was more so just that towards the end

62
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,000
i just kind of like realized that i

63
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,280
convinced myself that i was happy in the

64
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,680
relationship and that

65
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,119
i was fulfilled and i felt good about it

66
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,920
but in reality

67
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,440
um i wasn't and the way i would kind of

68
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,840
put it and explain it to people because

69
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,040
it was really shocking when we broke up

70
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:18,239
is that our relationship like

71
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,840
a through o

72
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,920
was incredible and we were super

73
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,920
compatible and there was so much good

74
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,360
but there was

75
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:30,640
p through z where i was like i don't

76
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,920
know if this is just what you sign up

77
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,360
for when you're in relationship

78
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,000
i don't know if these more negative

79
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,200
things i need to just settle for or if

80
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,720
there's somebody out there that

81
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,319
potentially could fulfill

82
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,920
me and compliment me more which i never

83
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,000
expect anybody to

84
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,840
be your everything and be your a to z

85
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,280
that's totally unrealistic but i think

86
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,080
it was a situation where i didn't know

87
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,560
what i didn't know

88
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,680
and i clearly just wasn't happy for a

89
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,360
number of different reasons

90
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,200
i'm not going to say those reasons i

91
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,800
know that everybody would want me to but

92
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,560
it's like there's still another person

93
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,239
in this situation that doesn't get to

94
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,120
share his piece so i think it would just

95
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,080
be like

96
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,840
super immoral and evil to like spill

97
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,440
dirt on somebody else and honestly i

98
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,159
harbor no resentment like we've both

99
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,879
moved on

100
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,319
i wouldn't say we're like friends but i

101
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,680
can certainly text him if there's

102
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,280
something like

103
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,800
pressing and like maybe we'll be friends

104
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,879
in the future so

105
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,640
that's that on that he was my first love

106
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,480
he'll always be my first love

107
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,239
i do not regret it i learned so much

108
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,239
from the relationship i look back on a

109
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,879
lot of fond memories but i am really

110
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,159
happy

111
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,000
i'm not really happy overall because

112
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,239
we're in a pandemic but i'm happy to

113
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,159
be single were you wilder than you let

114
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,920
on in your college vlogs and just chose

115
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,400
to maintain a cleaner image or is what

116
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,120
we saw

117
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,920
pretty much what there was to see

118
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,879
honestly

119
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,440
i wasn't that wild in college like i

120
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,560
definitely

121
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,799
drank but there wasn't any like wild

122
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,560
like i never had a fake id like i was

123
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,200
just this like normie kid pretty much

124
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,959
like

125
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,040
definitely in band there was some like

126
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,840
raunchy kind of stuff going on

127
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,840
and some like not so pg stuff but like i

128
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,519
vlogged at like band parties and stuff

129
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,599
so it's not like i was just

130
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,680
hey i'm always in the library i think my

131
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,319
college vlogs genuinely were like

132
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,920
pretty much an accurate representation

133
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,120
of what was going on which is probably

134
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,560
not the answer that you guys want to

135
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,239
hear but that's

136
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,120
that's my take would you ever have a

137
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,880
public semi-public relationship again

138
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,560
um i think maybe i would let you guys

139
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,759
know that i'm in a relationship or maybe

140
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,440
i would post

141
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,880
bits and pieces but i don't think i

142
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,919
would ever want

143
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,120
to advertise my relationship online

144
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,560
again just because

145
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,960
and i've like had a lot of reckoning

146
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,880
with this i choose to share a lot of my

147
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,120
life online and i would never want to

148
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,919
feel like i was subtly encouraging

149
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,280
or influencing my partner my friends my

150
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:45,520
loved ones to like

151
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,120
need to be a part of my youtube videos

152
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,400
because it's hard to live your life

153
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,919
publicly online like

154
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,000
you get a lot of criticism you get a lot

155
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,440
of eyes watching you and and while i

156
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,040
make that choice for myself i would

157
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,199
never want to make that choice

158
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,120
for someone else so i think that's kind

159
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,199
of why i wouldn't want to live

160
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,960
my life publicly but then again like

161
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,240
this is single me talking so who knows

162
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,160
what will happen in the future

163
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,840
how's your grieving journey going since

164
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,000
the loss of your best friend

165
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,840
i don't talk about this in most of my

166
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,160
videos just because it is

167
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,479
so so personal i just feel like there's

168
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,120
not a lot of avenues to open up about it

169
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,440
online

170
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,880
i have done so very thoroughly in a

171
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,720
couple of videos because i know how

172
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,000
important it was for me to see others

173
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,600
grieving when i was grieving

174
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,520
and understand like what that looked

175
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,240
like for people to make me feel

176
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,000
less alone and more in community um and

177
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,720
my grief looks very different now it's

178
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,560
it's not

179
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,320
it's more in sort of the restoration

180
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,360
phase where

181
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,919
there are like really random moments i

182
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,000
remember

183
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,919
i was interviewing for my job for a

184
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,919
promotion and

185
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,440
i was prepping the night before and i

186
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,199
had all this work to do and

187
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,039
this presentation to make and for some

188
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,880
reason out of nowhere just like a pang

189
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,639
of grief hit me over her

190
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,160
and i spent that night like really

191
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,039
really intensely

192
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,800
in my feelings and crying and just sort

193
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,319
of

194
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,720
re-mourning that loss because

195
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,639
it's it's never gone i think about her

196
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,080
literally every single day and i

197
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,000
can feel myself already getting

198
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,680
emotional about it it's never too deep

199
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,120
below the surface but it's not at the

200
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,600
surface anymore

201
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,639
if that makes any sense what's up with

202
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,639
your dating life

203
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,400
i have dated around and dated a few

204
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,919
people nothing serious

205
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,759
nothing like i would ever title a

206
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,800
relationship i'm not dating

207
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,080
anymore because my mom is

208
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,919
immunocompromised and so that would be

209
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,000
horribly recklessly irresponsible and i

210
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,639
could never do that to her so

211
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,440
um while i'm super open to it and i

212
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,080
would love

213
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,160
to meet some people and just like

214
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,560
explore that part of my life

215
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,080
i am not currently do you regret posting

216
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,919
your relationship on the internet

217
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,520
yeah like i actually want to answer yes

218
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,840
to this um

219
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,960
i don't regret the relationship very

220
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,400
distinctly

221
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:57,520
at all what i do regret was like

222
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,680
blasting it online but to give past cats

223
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,000
some grace there was literally no way

224
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,720
my little brain would have been able to

225
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,919
comprehend

226
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,759
like that a relationship can end nobody

227
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,440
ever expects their relationship to end

228
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,599
so when i see people posting their

229
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,840
relationships online in like a very like

230
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,720
in like a very confident way i totally

231
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,240
understand

232
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,000
i don't think i'm alone in feeling this

233
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,800
way i think a lot of youtubers share

234
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,120
these

235
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,639
feelings and i think a lot of youtubers

236
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,520
on their second time around with a

237
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,440
relationship

238
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,039
just get a lot more conscious with what

239
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,560
they share some of them still choose to

240
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,000
share their relationships but they

241
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,919
become a lot more conscious with what

242
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,120
to share i've like unlisted a few of the

243
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,120
videos just that i felt

244
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,639
uncomfortable having still up but like a

245
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,360
number of them still are just because

246
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,960
i'm like

247
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,639
that's a part of my life that happened i

248
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,599
would never try to erase that

249
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,000
or pretend it never happened i'm proud

250
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,919
of that

251
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,759
relationship and like it's definitely

252
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,840
cringe to look back on

253
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,440
yourself and all of the like all the

254
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,919
puppy love and all of that

255
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,840
but um it's something i've like reckoned

256
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,120
with and gotten to a place where i'm

257
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,720
good what are your thoughts on the

258
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,639
recent trend of people leaving

259
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,000
california and relocating to a different

260
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,000
state slash country

261
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,680
something you've recently considered oh

262
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,360
my god guys

263
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,039
maybe i do have a hot take about this

264
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,800
one in that i

265
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,039
feel like a lot of the people leaving

266
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,360
california the graham stefans the joe

267
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:18,160
rogans the tim ferrisses of the world

268
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,120
it comes from a place of wealth and not

269
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,440
so much

270
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,479
a quality of life thing it comes from

271
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,840
place i think

272
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,280
chiefly what they really like or

273
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,199
predominantly what they mention in those

274
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,599
videos and what i hear from them is like

275
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,680
the taxes are too high or like it's too

276
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:34,479
hard to maintain my business here

277
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,320
like sort of coming from like a i know

278
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,839
that my money is more valuable

279
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,000
elsewhere versus for me i don't live in

280
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,240
california

281
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,919
to like optimize my wealth my goal in

282
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,080
life is not to accumulate wealth that's

283
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,839
not what i associate success with

284
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,839
it's obviously necessary to pay your

285
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,760
bills and receive health care in this

286
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,320
country like you need to like

287
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,279
have a job to just you know literally

288
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,440
exist

289
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,360
but i am not in the business of like

290
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,720
climbing to billionaire status so

291
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,560
i think the reason i have trouble is

292
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,680
because like a lot of things they

293
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,320
mentioned are like

294
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,720
the unhoused folks that really troubled

295
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,880
them

296
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,560
and i'm like i personally don't view

297
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:14,240
folks that are unhoused

298
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:16,080
as a facet of the city as like a quality

299
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,839
of the city like the traffic would be or

300
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,440
like the restaurants would be i'm like

301
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,440
they're people they're not like

302
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:25,920
something you can just mention

303
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:27,600
as a characteristic of the city

304
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,959
like like we literally have more empty

305
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,959
houses in this country than

306
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:33,440
unhoused people i think by a magnitude

307
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:35,120
of like 1.5 x like if we wanted to and

308
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,560
it's nuanced and it's complicated i know

309
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,120
it's not as easy as this but if we

310
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,680
wanted to

311
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,120
we could house so many of these folks we

312
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,720
just choose not to because there's no

313
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,800
profit in it and there's no

314
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,480
financial incentive to do that and

315
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,519
there's so many other countries where we

316
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,440
don't see

317
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,640
a homelessness crisis because they just

318
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,240
choose to

319
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:56,000
support their people differently so

320
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,080
that's the t that's the shade that being

321
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,440
said i'm like a california loyalist

322
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,519
i love this place i've always

323
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,519
evangelized it that doesn't mean i won't

324
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,120
criticize it and criticize like policy

325
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,640
choices made in california that doesn't

326
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,399
mean that i'm just like

327
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,640
blasting sunshine on it and saying it's

328
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,079
the best place ever for sure not

329
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,519
but you know i am looking to move to

330
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,880
washington and move to seattle and

331
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,079
experience something outside of

332
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,600
california

333
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:20,560
um would love to move abroad i would

334
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,360
love to live

335
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,320
in shanghai again i have a lot of

336
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,120
reoccurring

337
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,240
nostalgia for that time in my life and

338
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,279
living there

339
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,360
and i also can really see myself in like

340
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,959
zurich and switzerland i think would be

341
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,959
a really amazing experience

342
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,800
um so yeah it's not to say that you

343
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,079
won't see a leaving california video

344
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,640
from me but it's gonna be a very

345
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,880
different

346
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,240
outlook it's not because i'm like trying

347
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,760
to buy a massive house

348
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,880
you know it's like not from that angle

349
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,200
that i would ever leave it's just

350
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:52,800
because i myself for my personal growth

351
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:55,040
would depart but like i really probably

352
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,320
maybe will boomerang back here at some

353
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,920
point um

354
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,760
especially because my family's here have

355
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,440
you ever questioned your sexuality not

356
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,040
sure if it's just the crunchy vibes but

357
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,480
i feel like you might listen to sweater

358
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,040
weather lol

359
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,600
so i think i actually have been seeing

360
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,920
more

361
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,720
um comments about this since i've like

362
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,160
moved

363
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:16,240
more in the granola direction and

364
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,240
like many of my best friends are sapphic

365
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,320
and i just get along really well with

366
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,000
with my wlw women

367
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,600
um if you had asked me this question

368
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,800
like six months ago i'd be like no i

369
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,160
know for sure that i'm like

370
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,000
only attracted to men this is in

371
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,760
no way coming out video guys and i don't

372
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,240
want to be like yeah i'm like playing

373
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,320
with my sexuality it's more so just like

374
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,839
i feel like the time alone has given a

375
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,399
lot of people in my life

376
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,040
time to like rethink their gender and

377
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,279
the way they

378
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,760
perform their gender and like their

379
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,200
sexuality and a lot of that because

380
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,320
you just have time to spend with

381
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,320
yourself so i'm not trying to like

382
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,760
queerbait or anything i'm just being

383
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,519
open with the fact that i never thought

384
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,880
i would question my sexuality and i'm

385
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,560
in this moment um that's not to say that

386
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,000
like i'm gonna arrive at any sort of

387
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,680
conclusion that's different than the one

388
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,440
i have today

389
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,959
given that you're so anti-capitalist and

390
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,639
anti-hustle culture

391
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,000
why do you continue to work in sales at

392
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,680
a major tech company

393
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,120
why don't you instead work in government

394
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,480
or at a non-profit

395
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,160
given that you're back living with your

396
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,920
family it seems like the perfect time to

397
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,440
work in a less high-paying field

398
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,959
though speaking from experience you can

399
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,760
definitely earn a high wage in public

400
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,639
service

401
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,839
love this question am i a big ass

402
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,959
hypocrite lady

403
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,880
for saying oh my god i hate capitalism

404
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,600
and i hate this economic system that has

405
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,880
really like

406
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:37,760
hurt so many working-class americans

407
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,639
um and globally hurt so many working

408
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,680
class folks

409
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,120
um got a ton of reckoning and i think a

410
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,399
lot of my thoughts on this topic are

411
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,480
sort of circular

412
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,000
where i think about it and i'm like my

413
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,320
job is definitely

414
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,760
propping up capitalism but when i look

415
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,200
at a job and a lot of my friends and

416
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,800
non-profits

417
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,240
talk about the non-profit industrial

418
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,200
complex where when you work at a

419
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,040
non-profit

420
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,279
it actually is also propping up

421
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,680
capitalism and not to get too much into

422
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,680
like

423
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,040
economic theory or like political theory

424
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,000
because i know that's not really why

425
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,920
people come to my channel

426
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,079
but it's a huge passion of mine and i

427
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,240
felt like i've learned so much about my

428
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,519
political identity and gotten a real

429
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,519
political education

430
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,040
in a way i never did growing up so

431
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,680
that's why i want to talk about it

432
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,120
but nonprofits also do prop up

433
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,040
capitalism because

434
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,959
um when you have a government that

435
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,760
chooses to privatize a lot of social

436
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,480
services

437
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,560
like healthcare um like housing

438
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,519
non-profits oftentimes exist to try to

439
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,680
band-aid those

440
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,120
problems and where the pipes are sort of

441
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,920
leaking and busting open

442
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,720
a non-profit says hey let's use like you

443
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,120
know

444
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,000
money from bill and melinda gates to

445
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,199
help fix this

446
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,040
issue but it's not actually fix you know

447
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:50,000
addressing the root cause

448
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,839
of the incentives of capitalism and the

449
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,600
reason we don't have those

450
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,120
um problems addressed at the root i

451
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,639
don't know if i explain that whatsoever

452
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,760
but i just know and i've heard from

453
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,279
friends that like

454
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:04,000
want to do more public service work that

455
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:05,440
a lot of jobs you still feel like you're

456
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,199
just a cog in the machine and that

457
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,839
you're just propping up this system so

458
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,600
it's not

459
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,600
you we all have to participate in

460
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,399
capitalism i'll never have a job

461
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,160
that's outside of capitalism because

462
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,160
that's like saying you can be a fish

463
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,320
living on land it's like we currently

464
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,800
live in water until we all

465
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,360
as fish get together and decide we want

466
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,519
to

467
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,440
become amphibians and move on to land

468
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,959
like the water is what we got and you

469
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,880
have to live in this world

470
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,320
and maybe some of us can try to swim

471
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,079
closer to

472
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,000
the top of the water and try to see the

473
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,360
other options that are out there

474
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,040
i don't know if this analogy is making

475
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,279
any sense but

476
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,440
i would never criticize somebody for

477
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,920
participating in capitalism

478
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,240
um because that's the situation we have

479
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,519
like we all do that there we are not bad

480
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,680
capitalists because

481
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,120
we're not the people that um are

482
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,560
creating the problems does that make

483
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,199
sense like we're just working class

484
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,040
people

485
00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:01,600
helping the rich get richer not to get

486
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,360
too charged here but at the top like i

487
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,839
literally could talk about forever i

488
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,920
love

489
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,920
um thinking about these sorts of things

490
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:11,279
so okay tldr

491
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:14,079
am i going to stay in sales forever no i

492
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:15,120
am interested in working in different

493
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:18,240
areas that

494
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,600
more closely align with my values but

495
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,720
will i ever get to a place where i'm

496
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,480
going to tell you guys

497
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,560
yeah i'm just doing like the best work

498
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,560
ever no i've tried to remove

499
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,320
any sort of superiority complex that

500
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,440
like anybody's job is better than

501
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,680
someone else's job

502
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,639
like we are just selling our labor like

503
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,000
getting our

504
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,680
bags that we can pay our bills and

505
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,440
support our families like

506
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,079
i would never criticize somebody for not

507
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,199
doing like ethical work because there

508
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,600
is no ethical consumption under

509
00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:46,240
capitalism

510
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,000
how much do you earn um i feel like i

511
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,160
always have to explain myself and give

512
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,320
you guys the context because

513
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,720
i am trying to be as class conscious as

514
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,360
possible and i know that my life

515
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,639
is so different from the majority of

516
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,160
lives of americans

517
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,079
in large part because of my

518
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,240
intergenerational wealth my

519
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,519
my white privilege i did not earn what i

520
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,040
earned today

521
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,120
based on meritocracy and because i

522
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,000
worked harder for it than somebody else

523
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,920
it is literally so fueled by the

524
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,880
community i was raised the school i was

525
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,040
able to go to

526
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,079
that's just my little two cents my

527
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,360
salary

528
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:23,120
for my tech job is not fixed because

529
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,639
it's sales so i have a base salary that

530
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,880
i'm guaranteed

531
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,079
every month then that's 50 of my salary

532
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,639
and then 50

533
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:33,839
so half of my salary is commissioned so

534
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:36,800
if i close no deals this year which like

535
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,199
who knows i will earn zero dollars of

536
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,600
the

537
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,360
expected commission and if any of my

538
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,839
customers cancel their contracts i

539
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:46,000
actually owe the company money so

540
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,360
this is literally so subject to change

541
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,399
but as long as i don't go into the

542
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,000
negatives my

543
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:54,240
base salary is 92 000 which is

544
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,920
so much more than i ever thought i'd be

545
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,160
making out of college that's like

546
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,759
astronomical and then like i said it's

547
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,399
50 so if you do the math

548
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,400
my target earnings would be 185 000.

549
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,199
that's super recent i wasn't

550
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,480
targeted to make that much until this

551
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,079
new role i took

552
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,919
so it's not like i've been making that

553
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:14,559
amount for the past five years like it

554
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,480
very much was incrementally stepped up

555
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:18,000
um when i first came out of college i

556
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,280
was not making six figures i think

557
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,839
i was making like 60k so um which is

558
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,880
still

559
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,679
a ton of money like that's an insane

560
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,280
amount of money

561
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:31,360
um and then youtube it's really not

562
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,960
as much as you would think guys like i

563
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,799
don't have a manager i'm just this like

564
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,960
indie youtuber like i don't have people

565
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,799
that are like sending me pr packages and

566
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,360
like reaching out to brands to partner

567
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,280
with me

568
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,480
so i would say youtube i earn like

569
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,440
around

570
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,640
nine or ten thousand dollars um a year

571
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,520
like i said i'm trying to be class

572
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,960
conscious

573
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,400
it's one thing to say i earned this much

574
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,000
money and it's so much money and that's

575
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,799
crazy and it's another thing to say

576
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,400
what can i do if you all have folks in

577
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,559
your life that are seeking

578
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,880
any sort of like mutual aid type

579
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,080
situation especially black trans folks

580
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,600
if you have any

581
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,720
gofundmes or memos or twitter threads of

582
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,720
folks that need help

583
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,760
like please put those in the comments

584
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,160
that's my

585
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,000
mo's to make sure that i am

586
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,840
redistributing my wealth the way

587
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,280
that i can without you guys even

588
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,880
suggesting anything i'm already doing

589
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,640
that i just want to say i'm not asking

590
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,080
you guys to provide that labor for me

591
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,919
i'm just saying if there's folks that i

592
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,039
don't know about through my own research

593
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,200
into mutual aid

594
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,640
let me know i would love to support um

595
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,280
any of

596
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,280
your causes your local causes and

597
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:36,400
individual folks rather than

598
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,320
maybe huge non-profits that a lot of

599
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,600
their overhead goes to administration

600
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,200
fees rather than the individual people

601
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,720
that's that on that do you ever have a

602
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,520
tough time feeling like you might have

603
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,039
already peaked

604
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,720
i'm about to graduate college and i'm

605
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:52,160
definitely starting to feel this

606
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:54,000
i have already just claimed for myself

607
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,559
that i know i peaked in high school

608
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,160
i have never been as confident had as

609
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:01,360
high of self-esteem

610
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:04,960
um felt as bright

611
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:07,760
and as just on top of my [ __ ]

612
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,320
as i was in high school but i would say

613
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,799
there's no

614
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,320
negative like i don't have a tough time

615
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:15,200
now feeling like

616
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,799
i am no longer that like incredible and

617
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,559
maybe it's achievement oriented that i

618
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,720
feel like i peaked in high school like

619
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,559
i'm trying less and less to orient my

620
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,559
success and my worth and my value over

621
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:27,200
what i achieve and what i accomplish

622
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,799
and more just about my fulfillment i was

623
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,720
very fulfilled in high school so even if

624
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,480
i look at that through that angle like i

625
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,480
was still very fulfilled then

626
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,679
but that's not to say that i still can't

627
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,919
be fulfilled today

628
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,520
so i love that i'm constantly growing

629
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:41,360
and evolving and changing and i'm not

630
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,880
the same person i came onto youtube and

631
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,600
recorded my first video

632
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,000
as you know almost 10 years ago so i

633
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,600
would

634
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,840
almost rather backslide from my peak

635
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,799
than peak and stay that exact same

636
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,559
person forever

637
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,000
that's the thing about peaking is it's a

638
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,200
point in time you're never going to

639
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,960
maintain the peak

640
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,760
so i kind of feel good that like maybe

641
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,600
my progress hasn't always gone up and up

642
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,799
but progress and like growth isn't

643
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,960
always linear

644
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,480
um we've seen that in the past year

645
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,240
that's the way that goes so

646
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,400
what do you want to do youtube full-time

647
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,360
if it paid as well as your current job

648
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,720
this is an answer that i was so

649
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,280
confident about when i had

650
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,559
i did a q a i think january of last year

651
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,559
i'll link it below if you want to

652
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,640
watch that one and see how much my like

653
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,919
ideals and how i present myself and all

654
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,640
of that has changed

655
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,080
but um i was always really feel fearful

656
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,799
of being self-employed

657
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,679
i think because i was so used to having

658
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,679
structure

659
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,679
put upon me i'm so used to being a

660
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,880
lifelong student where i have classes at

661
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,720
these certain times

662
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,640
they tell me these are the mate the

663
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,080
classes required for your major

664
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,080
you know here's what you have to take

665
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,280
you have some freedom but here's pretty

666
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,039
much prescriptively

667
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,440
what you gotta do and then being in a

668
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,559
job it's like here's the job description

669
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,320
here's your role

670
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,000
here's what we're expecting of you and

671
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,600
then you get to decide do you wanna

672
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,679
try to beat those expectations do you

673
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,640
wanna just ride through it

674
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,159
that felt comfortable to me and i think

675
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,760
now i'm looking at it and i'm like i

676
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,480
think it was because i was just buying

677
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,640
into like

678
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,320
the paths that upset you know in front

679
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,320
of me i'm basically recording a [ __ ]

680
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,520
podcast right now with these answers but

681
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,679
i've been talking to a few folks because

682
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,360
i'm like if i were to redo my education

683
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,760
or pursue education again

684
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,760
i wouldn't really want a degree where

685
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,559
they enforce exactly which classes you

686
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,640
have to take

687
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,559
i would want to take classes that i just

688
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,880
find the most interesting and

689
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,600
i'm most curious about and like build my

690
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,240
own

691
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,200
degree per se and just take individual

692
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,720
classes

693
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:40,559
so i'm becoming more and more like

694
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:43,120
interested in building my own structure

695
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,000
so that is to say youtube wouldn't ever

696
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,000
have to pay the same

697
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,520
as my tech job for me to want to do it

698
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,679
full time i still

699
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,720
struggle with like it's just so hard to

700
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,640
stay relevant

701
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,559
on youtube and i think i would literally

702
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,480
drive myself cuckoo bonkers

703
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,919
right now when my views dip i'm like oh

704
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,840
that doesn't feel great but it's also

705
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:01,919
like nobody has to watch my videos

706
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,039
it's just a form of creative expression

707
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,960
for me it's not like

708
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,320
i will literally not be able to pay rent

709
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,679
if my videos flop

710
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,440
but it would be really scary to be in

711
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,799
that position i thought i was going to

712
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,240
answer this question very differently

713
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,600
but now i'm seeing that i still have

714
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,480
kind of the same answer as last year

715
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,720
which is that

716
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,400
i would have a lot of caution around

717
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,159
doing youtube full-time but

718
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,679
i no longer look at people that do it

719
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,280
full-time and think oh my god that's

720
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,880
like so crazy and risky because i've

721
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,320
seen so many folks thrive

722
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,840
when they do it full-time does your

723
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,360
parents pay for your college and do you

724
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,480
feel privileged because of it

725
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:34,000
yes and yes my parents saved what is it

726
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,799
a 501

727
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,960
k there's a certain fund you can save

728
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,400
tax-free

729
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,960
from the time your child is like

730
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:46,640
literally conceived i think for college

731
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:49,679
and my parents prioritized that because

732
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,320
they had tech jobs where they were able

733
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,159
to

734
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,320
pay for that they had enough for three

735
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,080
years of a private education

736
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,080
and that is why i graduated from usc a

737
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,799
year early came in with ap

738
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,440
credits and said to myself i would

739
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,679
rather

740
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,880
have a three year experience at usc and

741
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,039
not be in like

742
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,960
60 to 70k of debt that i would have to

743
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:11,760
pay because they didn't save for me

744
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,840
then do the four years and have the debt

745
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,840
or go to a different school you know

746
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,280
um i really wanted the usc experience

747
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,799
for myself and i'm genuinely really

748
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:22,000
happy with the way i

749
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:24,400
went into that experience but i was only

750
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,520
able to make that decision because of

751
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,240
the

752
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,760
money my parents saved for me and i i've

753
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,360
been i don't think i've always been very

754
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,520
forthcoming about that and i'm trying to

755
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,520
be more and more forthcoming that i know

756
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:38,080
that my accomplishments are not my own

757
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:41,520
and that i'm standing on the shoulders

758
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:43,120
of um my parents where a lot of people

759
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,559
don't have shoulders to stand on feels

760
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,240
like you've changed a lot in the past

761
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,520
year or so how do your parents feel

762
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,520
about that change and has your

763
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,760
relationship with them also changed

764
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,600
i might actually do a video on kind of

765
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,159
like i'm about to turn 25 so maybe like

766
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,279
20

767
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:59,520
25 things i've learned before 25

768
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:00,720
i love those videos um i don't know if

769
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,120
any of you would be interested in that

770
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,640
but

771
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,000
i might just make it for myself you know

772
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,480
to kind of have something to look back

773
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,320
on

774
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,000
and if you want to watch it you can i

775
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,600
just i don't think there's been a year

776
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,480
in my life where i've learned

777
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,679
change developed in positive and

778
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,520
negative ways

779
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,400
more than this year like it's not just

780
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:20,799
all positive politically like i i

781
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,000
grew up pretty damn aligned with my

782
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:25,279
parents

783
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,360
and now i've moved um

784
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:29,039
a little a little little maybe a lot

785
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,279
further away from them

786
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,240
and i'm not the kind of person to like

787
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,480
hide who i am

788
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,640
and like hide what i believe i love to

789
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,400
have conversations i love to

790
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,679
be challenged about what i think and so

791
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,640
i've had a lot of those conversations

792
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,559
with my parents

793
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,159
doesn't result in a lot of like positive

794
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,880
warm and fuzzy feelings i'll just

795
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,919
be completely honest about that um but

796
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,080
it's not like they're

797
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,600
disappointed in me or anything i think

798
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,600
they're glad that i

799
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,120
can make up my own mind in this world

800
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:59,760
and that i'm not just like

801
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:02,000
literally following um exactly what

802
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,279
they would have done do you ever wish

803
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,960
you'd made different decisions in the

804
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:07,200
past and pursued other interests for

805
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:10,240
your education and career

806
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,720
does anybody ever feel fully confident

807
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,000
in their decisions because i'm just a

808
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,919
lady that's full of self-doubt

809
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,440
and i love and i think it's healthy to

810
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:20,480
doubt and

811
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,919
question um you know yourself and try to

812
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,480
like grow your self-awareness

813
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:26,240
if i could imbue 18 year old catherine

814
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,240
with the knowledge i know today

815
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,919
i would make much different decisions

816
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,520
but that's not how life works like the

817
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,440
brain i had at 18

818
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,120
what i learned about the world in my

819
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,039
very small bubble

820
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,880
i made decisions that i was happy with

821
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:40,559
and i don't regret those decisions

822
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,159
because i know that i did the best with

823
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,679
the information i had at the time

824
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,440
that being said if i were to go back to

825
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:48,400
school back to school now like

826
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,799
redo education like now i'm a lot more

827
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:53,679
interested in like political science

828
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,480
um and more like structural work rather

829
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,159
than

830
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,919
learning about like private companies

831
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,720
and that kind of thing would you ever

832
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,200
oh my god this is a wild question wow

833
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,600
would you

834
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,679
seriously date mary someone who is lower

835
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,640
than you socioeconomically

836
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,279
if yes would your parents be upset for

837
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,200
sure

838
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:16,080
i am no longer classist about who i date

839
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,840
i for sure was like i remember thinking

840
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,360
like i need to date someone that earns a

841
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,880
certain amount because i know i want to

842
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,240
live in the bay area and in order to

843
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,240
afford a house in the bay area you have

844
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,200
to have x dual income to afford this and

845
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,880
afford that

846
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,480
and it was very much like i was planning

847
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,960
out my entire life path

848
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,720
but now i'm less like i need to buy a

849
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,640
house i'm like it would be okay if i had

850
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,480
to rent forever i'm not like

851
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,919
100 nailed down to living in the bay

852
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,720
area so it's not like i need someone

853
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,159
that's

854
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,799
you know working in tech and doing that

855
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,840
whole thing so for sure i would date

856
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,880
someone

857
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,880
um lower than me socioeconomically like

858
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,320
for sure but i will acknowledge that i

859
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,159
didn't always think like that

860
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,000
and would my parents be upset hopefully

861
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,640
not we'll cross that bridge if we ever

862
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,240
get to it

863
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,600
is there a video you regret posting and

864
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,159
what's your favorite video that you've

865
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,679
made

866
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,440
my favorite video that i've made is

867
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,880
actually my transformation into a

868
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,400
granola girl video

869
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,400
i think the way i packaged it with the

870
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,919
title and the thumbnail it didn't

871
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,440
get it didn't seem as appealing because

872
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,799
i'm just i'm just really bad at titles

873
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,159
and thumbnails guys like i'm just

874
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,000
that's the hardest part of youtube for

875
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,559
me so i think i packaged it in the wrong

876
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,399
way but the actual content of the video

877
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:20,000
i'm so so happy with and i think it's

878
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:21,679
the best work i've ever done

879
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,279
i think i'm like the most me in that

880
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,279
video and i just think i was able to

881
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:27,440
channel a ton of creativity in there so

882
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,320
check it out because i think it it is

883
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,559
really different than

884
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,720
what i've made in the past and i like it

885
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:35,679
um a video i regret posting

886
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,480
is the video i talked about how i saved

887
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,640
50 000

888
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,080
my first year out of college because i

889
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,320
was so

890
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,240
like entitled in that video and i had

891
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,399
such a lack of conception of like the

892
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,279
economic reality of most americans and i

893
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:50,240
think my

894
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:51,600
financial advice in that video was very

895
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,120
non-inclusive

896
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,399
i would i actually haven't watched it in

897
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,679
years and years but i just remember

898
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:57,039
getting a lot of comments about like hey

899
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,159
dude like the only reason you're able to

900
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,279
save is because you didn't have any

901
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,200
student loans

902
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,480
and i wasn't upfront about that so i

903
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,520
think i just approached that video the

904
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,679
wrong way

905
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,720
um i've tried to make my financial

906
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,480
videos in the in

907
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,399
the last couple ones i did much more

908
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,919
inclusive let me know if i've

909
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:13,520
accomplished that if i still have you

910
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:16,320
know work to you know

911
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,600
work to go on that on a scale of one to

912
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,720
gay where do you think you

913
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,720
fall is there a scale of one to gay what

914
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,039
happened with your college bf do we hate

915
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,240
him no we don't hate him

916
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:28,000
okay i just looked through all the

917
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,960
questions and everything else was either

918
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,600
a repeat

919
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,559
or something i've already answered in a

920
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,919
previous video

921
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:36,240
please leave me a comment with what

922
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:38,080
surprised you the most or

923
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,000
the biggest hot take of the video in

924
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,760
your opinion you might not agree with

925
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,480
everything i said in this video and i

926
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,799
totally get that i think i gave you guys

927
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,720
a

928
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:48,720
much bigger window into my world view

929
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,640
than i usually do i might have voiced

930
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,080
some unpopular opinions i totally get

931
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,320
that i'm growing and changing and

932
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,159
shifting and just trying to figure out

933
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,080
who i am in this world and i hope that

934
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:01,360
you will give me grace that

935
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:03,120
um i'm just trying my best when i know

936
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,720
better i do better

937
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,320
sometimes i do not know better if

938
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,520
somehow you're watching this video and

939
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,600
you're not subscribed

940
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,799
that red button is so much prettier when

941
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,320
it turns gray

942
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,320
and you just have to click it and

943
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,679
finally if a lot of this was surprising

944
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,440
to you and you felt like you learned a

945
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,240
lot more about me in this video than you

946
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,600
usually do

947
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,200
i feel like my twitter and instagram

948
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,720
fill out a lot more of my life just

949
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,360
because youtube is a very specific

950
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:28,640
medium to package content in so

951
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,840
if you want to explore any more of my

952
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,520
radical takes

953
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,200
twitter is the vehicle for that

954
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,760
instagram is the vehicle for random

955
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,080
thoughts

956
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,880
and realizations i have thank you so

957
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,880
much for watching

958
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,280

959
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:49,270

960
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:49,270
