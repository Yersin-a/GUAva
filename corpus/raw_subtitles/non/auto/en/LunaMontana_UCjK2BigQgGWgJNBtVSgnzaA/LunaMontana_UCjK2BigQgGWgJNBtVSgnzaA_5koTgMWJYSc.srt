film always which is a girl talk

11
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,199
this one specifically about body image

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,960
body positivity

13
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,480
self love i would say it's one of the

14
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,960
main reasons my channel kind of started

15
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,240
for me

16
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,920
it's definitely my mission and my

17
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,240
purpose here on youtube i have a

18
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,279
multitude of videos on this subject that

19
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,040
i will link below

20
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,559
my most recent one was about like half a

21
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,320
year ago and that was called accepting

22
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,680
my weight gain as a ballerina and if you

23
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,840
want to know kind of my whole story with

24
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,680
my body image from the age of 13 till

25
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,360
now then watch that video i'd love to

26
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,039
update you guys where my head's at when

27
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,360
it comes to body image because i feel

28
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,960
like

29
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,879
it helps you but most importantly it

30
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,840
helps me and i would say that i'm at a

31
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,000
different place than

32
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,160
i was half a year ago when i filmed that

33
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,719
video honestly a worse place which is

34
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,160
scary

35
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,000
again i want to talk to you guys about

36
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,840
it maybe we can handle it together

37
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,440
you guys know i ask on my instagram for

38
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,800
you to ask me questions so if you ever

39
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,559
want to be involved with a girl talk

40
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,400
follow me on instagram at luna montana

41
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,680
okay so starting off i got a lot of

42
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,600
questions about me

43
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,200
and how i'm doing a lot of you guys have

44
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,080
been noticing that i've been losing

45
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,960
weight you're saying

46
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,280
tends to change within me i think i lost

47
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,040
a

48
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,880
drastic amount of weight and i didn't

49
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,000
even realize that i did during my

50
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,240
breakup which was in

51
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,520
october it was a lot emotionally for me

52
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,840
a big lifestyle change

53
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,600
i just completely lost my appetite i

54
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,159
also just started dancing every day

55
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,200
for my head and my emotional being all

56
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,479
of that combined just

57
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,240
made me lose weight and i didn't even

58
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,600
realize that i did until people started

59
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,079
commenting on instagram my family

60
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,840
started

61
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,360
worrying it was a weird period but from

62
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,280
then till now i think i've kind of

63
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,640
leveled out and gained the weight back

64
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,880
weirdly enough and i've heard this from

65
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,560
a lot of people that accidentally lose

66
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,000
weight or whatever you get so much

67
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,680
praise and attention and

68
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,720
in that moment too of emotional distress

69
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,000
that i was going through like that

70
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,000
attention from other people

71
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,439
almost like validation gaining it back

72
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,719
like looking back and stuff like that

73
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,240
it's been really hard for me and it

74
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,159
wasn't even intentional at all

75
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,840
no one should ever comment on another

76
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,439
person's body no matter what because

77
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,600
what if i was going through

78
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,280
something during that time and i got

79
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,599
comments and praise and then that would

80
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,200
completely fuel my fire and trigger me

81
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:12,800
from then till now i've definitely

82
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,480
struggled with gaining that weight back

83
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,080
and being happy but at the end of the

84
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,599
day i have to remember the emotional

85
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,480
state that i was in at the time

86
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,080
mentally was not well at all i'm not one

87
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,680
to not have an appetite i'm a food

88
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,360
lover take the image off of your

89
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,280
physical body and just think about your

90
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,720
inner being and just remember that i'm

91
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,640
getting healthier and healthier each

92
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,319
month regardless of how my body looks

93
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,560
next question is how do i stop

94
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,640
sabotaging myself through social media

95
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,160
i feel you girl i get into like these

96
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,200
huge stocking

97
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,440
bowls stocking every single instagram la

98
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,760
model on instagram for hours and i come

99
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,280
out feeling like the slimiest version of

100
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,879
myself there was one time where i did

101
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,560
that and like i swear i

102
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,239
booked a lip injection appointment for

103
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,400
the next week like i convinced myself

104
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,280
i'd face to my photos i need liposuction

105
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,360
in my cheeks i

106
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,280
convinced myself that my nose was big

107
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,000
and i needed a nose job like genuinely

108
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,599
so damaging for me and i'm not one to

109
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,200
think like that i quickly snapped out of

110
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,400
it something that we have to remember

111
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,800
when this happens

112
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,599
is the person that i'm comparing myself

113
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,959
to on instagram that's a post photo it's

114
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,680
obviously a good photo of them they're

115
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,959
not gonna post

116
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,120
something where they don't look good

117
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,879
most likely face tuned or photoshopped

118
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,200
that's just the reality of it or they

119
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,680
have work done so i'm comparing myself

120
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,000
to the

121
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,920
idolized version of them it's just it's

122
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,080
getting me nowhere it's just not natural

123
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,360
even if that person was naturally like a

124
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,879
completely perfect person

125
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,400
every single person is beautifully

126
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,000
different there's something that that

127
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,400
girl wants that you have

128
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,040
vice versa for me personally i just have

129
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,040
to remember

130
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,560
like why would i want to morph myself

131
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,480
into that girl

132
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,080
who that girl is making me feel

133
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,519
completely insecure why would i want to

134
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,280
do that to other girls and i'm not i'm

135
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,920
not bashing on these people i'm not i'm

136
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,920
just saying

137
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,680
for me and my brand and what i've built

138
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,360
my youtube channel based on like

139
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,879
self-love and accepting yourself why

140
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,799
would i want to try and be this perfect

141
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,760
person to make others insecure like me

142
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,120
getting messages

143
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,040
from girls saying that i've helped them

144
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,879
feel more confident or help them with

145
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,560
any type of eating disorder is way more

146
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,920
validating and gives me purpose than

147
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,680
someone saying i look hot or

148
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,959
they wish i had my lips or whatever

149
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,640
that's the purpose of life

150
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,000
i know that that's my purpose is using

151
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,840
my brain and using my

152
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,120
knowledge and experience to help other

153
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,519
people and not

154
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,280
using my looks or like looks that i buy

155
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,720
to make other people feel insecure

156
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,079
and again i'm not hating on people that

157
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,360
do decide to get work done or do

158
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,360
anything i really am not

159
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,960
until a lot of people can think the same

160
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,000
way like society is just not gonna

161
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,960
change we're still gonna have these

162
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,040
beauty standards

163
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,960
so i encourage all of you guys to start

164
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,120
the change let's be the change together

165
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,120
so many of us fall into society's idea

166
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,800
of beauty it's not ideal it's not

167
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,840
natural it's not affordable

168
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,440
it's not something you're gonna be

169
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,560
remembered for when you're in your grave

170
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,160
you're not going to be remembered for

171
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,320
your huge ass lips or

172
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,680
your small thighs it's just not how it

173
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,040
is you're going to be remembered for the

174
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,160
effect that you had on the world your

175
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,919
purpose your brain

176
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,520
everything it's just way more important

177
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,880
to me that being said you guys i have

178
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,560
probably one of the most exciting

179
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,320

betterhelp.com

226
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,000
luna next question is how can i get a

227
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,039
healthy relationship with food this took

228
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,280
me a while

229
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,639
i could have never imagined like two or

230
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,520
three years ago when i was struggling

231
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,280
the most to

232
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,720
even think about like my friends going

233
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,680
to mcdonald's and like me getting

234
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,600
something i knew

235
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,600
it was a problem when socially it would

236
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,800
affect me so let's just put an example

237
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,160
of like you're at a dinner party with

238
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,680
friends and you're all having a big

239
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,880
pizza but you don't want to eat that one

240
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,479
piece of pizza because you're trying to

241
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,880
whatever diet and it's just making you

242
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,639
sad

243
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,919
for me all night i would be upset and

244
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,800
like staring at this one thing i'd

245
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,160
fixate on it

246
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,280
and socially everyone else was having a

247
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,639
good time but i wasn't just because i

248
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,720
didn't have a slice of pizza

249
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,680
think about in five years not like even

250
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,880
less than five years

251
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,319
honestly a month from now you're not

252
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,880
gonna remember that one piece of pizza

253
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,160
that you ate

254
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,759
quality of life the time you would have

255
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,280
spent with your friends like socially

256
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,720
you would have had a good time but you

257
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,759
weren't because you were so fixated on

258
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,360
that one thing so

259
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,639
intuitive eating is something that is so

260
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,440
important and it's one of the hardest

261
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,120
things to learn

262
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,639
i always feel a certain level of guilt

263
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,280
and i feel like that lives in with me

264
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,800
forever

265
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,479
one thing i really encourage you all to

266
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,240
try is just take the image off of your

267
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,400
physical body and think about your inner

268
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,840
being again what will make you happy

269
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,199
i use that example all the time but

270
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,039
you're gonna be laying in your grave one

271
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,880
day and the size of your thighs will not

272
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,479
mean a single thing that one piece of

273
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,000
pizza you ate will not mean a single

274
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,599
thing remember the grand scheme of life

275
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,720
remember your purpose what you're here

276
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,080
what you're set out to do

277
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,319
feeling guilt for eating when you're

278
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,560
hungry is like feeling guilt for like

279
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,840
breathing oxygen it's necessary to live

280
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,120
next question is how do you accept

281
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,080
weight gain so again i made a whole

282
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,160
video on this

283
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,080
but obviously being a ballerina weight

284
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,000
gain was always my worst nightmare

285
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,240
and it's weird because society's like

286
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,400
body beauty standard versus ballet is so

287
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,319
widely different like for ballet i just

288
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,840
never wanted a butt never wanted boobs i

289
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,440
wanted like no hips at all i wanted to

290
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,960
be square and then like and when i quit

291
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,560
and enter society it's a whole different

292
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,080
type of body image for me that was

293
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,840
almost in my favor because everything

294
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,919
that i was always fighting with my body

295
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,039
became like society's standard having a

296
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,039
butt having hips

297
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,800
having a waist like so in that sense i

298
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,080
was grateful but nevertheless

299
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,680
weight gain is something that's super

300
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,120
hard to accept i know you have to

301
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,120
remember that you are constantly growing

302
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,479
your body fluctuates like crazy

303
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,479
as long as you're healthy and treating

304
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,280
yourself right whatever shape or size

305
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,520
your body is

306
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,840
is what you were naturally made to look

307
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,960
like that's like your homeostasis right

308
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,240
if you're treating your body right

309
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,520
you're treating yourself you're happy

310
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,879
like with everything that you're doing

311
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,080
you're giving your body nutrients like

312
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,199
whatever your body looks like whether

313
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,639
it's this or this

314
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,759
that's your natural state that's

315
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,360
something that you can't change and

316
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,479
that's when you have to actually accept

317
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,080
what you look like that's what the

318
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,200
universe intended you to look like what

319
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,760
are some things you do that make you

320
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,360
feel good

321
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,800
physically and mentally so the number

322
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,880
one thing that is your homework

323
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,800
today that really helped me recently was

324
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,480
i went on instagram and i unfollowed

325
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,959
every single person that did not serve

326
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,040
me

327
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,640
a good purpose like i unfollowed every

328
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,880
single tick-tocker

329
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,399
model and i've never felt better i don't

330
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,560
know why i didn't do that earlier i only

331
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,560
follow people now that like inspire me

332
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,760
they have style inspiration other than

333
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,959
that i've been really trying to

334
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,640

and what it's taught me so that's your

349
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,839
homework i know it seems stupid and

350
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,720
ridiculous to stare at yourself in the

351
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,720
mirror and be like i

352
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,760
am worthy i am loved more and more you

353
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,959
keep doing it the more you're going to

354
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,480
start believing in it so

355
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,600
that is your homework how do i help

356
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,000
someone who's dealing with an eating

357
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,760
disorder

358
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,360
so again as a ballerina growing up in

359
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,480
the industry every single one of my

360
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,720
friends i would say

361
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,600
dealt with some sort of body dysmorphia

362
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,839
eating disorder

363
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,440
it's a really really hard thing to watch

364
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,399
i feel like for me i'm also just super

365
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,240
empathetic and

366
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,680
i feel so hopeless when i can't help

367
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,760
someone i do think it's important to

368
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,519
talk to someone just like a parent or a

369
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,000
counselor or a teacher or someone that

370
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,040
can help

371
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,880
i would really try and stay pretty

372
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,720
neutral i think commenting on someone's

373
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,079
body no matter what is damaging

374
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,680
just kind of be like i'm here to support

375
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,880
you no matter what you need like i want

376
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,399
to be here for you

377
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,000
i've had friends in and out of treatment

378
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,360
like it's a very very hard thing to

379
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,320
watch if you know someone that has

380
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,680
struggled who's

381
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,440
you know coming out of treatment or some

382
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,079
sort i know that meal times are very

383
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,920
very hard

384
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,760
so whenever those are around like try to

385
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,279
make it more comfortable more fun

386
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,720
a lot of times i feel like a burden and

387
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,079
it's hard when a lot of the attention's

388
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,040
on them especially when everyone knows

389
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,720
they're struggling so

390
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,480
try to make it more fun eat with them

391
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,079
always eat with them and just try to be

392
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,600
there and be of support as much as you

393
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,120
can but i know i know it's hard

394
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,800
my guy friends think self-love is

395
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,160
selfish what do i tell them they're just

396
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,079
saying that because they're threatened

397
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,160
that if you love yourself then

398
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,680
they'll feel lesser than so tell them

399
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,760
that they should try it sometime

400
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,760
confidence versus arrogance i really

401
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,160
don't think they go hand in hand because

402
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,920
confidence is just knowing that you are

403
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,600
the best version of yourself

404
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,040
not that you are above others because

405
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,399
society has already made it so hard to

406
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,519
love ourselves i really don't think it's

407
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,040
going to get that far

408
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,720
i don't think you have to worry between

409
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,320
that how to become more confident when

410
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,240
speaking okay this is actually probably

411
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,720
one of my biggest insecurities as of

412
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,800
late

413
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,480
i have found out that i'm actually

414
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,600
pretty shy when i meet people for the

415
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,320
first time and i'm

416
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,480
scared to say stuff and i i kind of beat

417
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,160
myself up over it because i feel like i

418
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,959
do have such a great personality and

419
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,800
obviously like

420
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,320
online i pour my heart and soul out to

421
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,760
you guys and i just i want people to

422
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,440
know my personality when i first meet

423
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,880
them like first impressions are huge for

424
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,839
me so i want people to know that i'm

425
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,000
like a cool person

426
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,839
stay so quiet because i'm so scared to

427
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,279
say something embarrassing or not cool

428
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,120
i found a tic toc that was like i'm

429
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,120
confident because when i speak i

430
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,560
simply choose not to feel embarrassed in

431
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,240
moments that i should be embarrassed

432
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,000
probably i just choose not to

433
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,519
so just be confident in your opinions

434
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,880
and your ideals and if that person

435
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,160
doesn't vibe with your personality or

436
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,839
what you're saying then like they're

437
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,839
lost it just doesn't click whatever

438
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,279
you're just delaying the process of that

439
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,640
if that makes sense how do i find the

440
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,079
difference between losing weight to be

441
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,600
healthy and losing weight to look

442
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,120
better okay so for me when i was

443
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,560
struggling really bad i would always use

444
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,399
it as an excuse that i want to eat

445
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,160
better to be healthier but in reality

446
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,600
i just wanted to lose weight it's weird

447
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,839
as i have quit ballet

448
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,360
and you know talk to normal people like

449
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,040
that live normal lives

450
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,959
it's so triggering for me to hear people

451
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,279
going on diets or people like

452
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,800
choosing not to eat bad or like whatever

453
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,000
because automatically my mind goes to

454
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,760
that but i have to remember

455
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,440
that you know there are situations in

456
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,519
which we live life

457
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,200
and we're not treating our bodies right

458
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,120
and we do need to take a step back for

459
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,600
example last week i was on set for a

460
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,600
movie

461
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,120
and i was on set nine to seven all five

462
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,120
days of the week on a movie set

463
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,720
they have craft services which craft

464
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,800
services says like doritos

465
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,880
chips ahoy fruit snacks stuff that i

466
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,279
never eat was never raised with

467
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,560
and i went crazy obviously i'm like

468
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,680
sitting on set all day and then

469
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,519
obviously i'm gone all day so i didn't

470
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,360
have time to do my normal workouts or

471
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,279
dance or anything so i wasn't moving

472
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,800
by the end of the week i literally felt

473
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,639
so gross i literally had pimples all

474
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,160
over my face i felt disgusting come the

475
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,600
weekend i told my trainer i was like hey

476
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,720
we have to grind this week like i'm

477
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,760
dancing every day this week and i'm

478
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,360
gonna eat clean and it wasn't

479
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,120
necessarily for my body at all

480
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,800
it was more for my inner being i felt

481
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,560
gross i didn't feel energetic

482
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,160
internally i wasn't feeling good again

483
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,920
you just have to assess your

484
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,079
motives and make sure that you're doing

485
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,399
it for the right reasons last question

486
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,160
how can i find myself worthy of love

487
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,600
again coming out of a breakup coming out

488
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,440
of a relationship where you

489
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,720
always had constant validation that you

490
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,920
were worthy at least for me because i

491
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,279
was in a healthy relationship

492
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,200
i ended the relationship because i

493
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,279
couldn't find that within myself i only

494
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,480
relied on outer validation from everyone

495
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,600
and then when i would try to find that

496
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,760
validation through

497
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,040
boys like and wouldn't get that back or

498
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,200
just entering this whole dating

499
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,880

500
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,920

person find someone that's worthy of

520
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,440
that not someone that makes you question

521
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,279
whether you're worthy at all

522
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,279
each and every one of you are worthy of

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,120

write down self affirmations i know it

528
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,160

somewhere you deserve to live a long
