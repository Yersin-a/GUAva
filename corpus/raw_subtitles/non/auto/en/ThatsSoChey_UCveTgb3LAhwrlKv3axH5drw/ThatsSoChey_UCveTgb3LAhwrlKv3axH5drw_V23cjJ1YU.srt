[Music]

2
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:37,610
I can't like it's

3
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,610
illegal for me to say

4
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:40,070
da right now because

5
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,070
if I say duh

6
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:42,140
I've been gone for a

7
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,140
minute like that's

8
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,820
like this is very

9
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,820
hurtful to do you guys

10
00:00:42,140 --> 00:01:07,729
like that I'm not

11
00:00:43,810 --> 00:01:07,729
gonna see the dog

12
00:00:43,820 --> 00:01:12,290

00:01:07,729 --> 00:01:19,850

15
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:19,850
he's gotta keep up

16
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:23,360
with me you could be

17
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,360
back be back baby

18
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:24,770
I'm trying to be

19
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,770
consistent at least a

20
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,909
video a week with

21
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,909
my charts like that

22
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:27,640
because I have a lot

23
00:01:25,899 --> 00:01:27,640
of things on my

24
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:30,680
plate right now and

25
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,680
I have not found

26
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,430
accurate balance I

27
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:31,430
don't let y'all know

28
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,040
where I've been

29
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:36,380
so keep listening it's

30
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,380
a little rambling

31
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,409
because like I'm

32
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:37,409
nervous I'm actually

33
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,210
very nervous because I

34
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:40,770
you guys are doing me again I've

35
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,659
forsaken you

36
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,859
so just take a little

37
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:43,859
time with me and

38
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:48,500
like my thoughts are

39
00:01:43,849 --> 00:01:48,500
everywhere without

40
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:48,500
further ado let's

41
00:01:51,079 --> 00:02:11,009
you too you too me

42
00:01:57,429 --> 00:02:11,009

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:14,250
it's been a while

44
00:02:10,999 --> 00:02:14,250
it's been a while I'm

45
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:16,379
sorry I'm sorry and

46
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,379
I'm going to explain

47
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:18,480
a bit of why I've

48
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:18,480
been missing for so

49
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:20,640
long and why I've

50
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,640
been so inconsistent

51
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,629
because I'm not in

52
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:24,629
connect I'm not an

53
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,160
inconsistent person

54
00:02:24,619 --> 00:02:26,160
and I'm pretty sure

55
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:28,310
why I love you guys

56
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,310
subscribe to my

57
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:32,910
channel is because

58
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,910
I was in consider

59
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:34,709
little NAT talk now

60
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,709
I'm pretty sure

61
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:36,299
the reason why you

62
00:02:34,699 --> 00:02:36,299
guys subscribe to my

63
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:38,099

65
00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:41,519
consistent I was

McDonald like like

00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:47,130
imma start from the

105
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:49,710
top like the first

106
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,710
week that I missed a

107
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:52,230
video to be honest it was catch

108
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:54,900
sleep to be completely

109
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,900
honest when I

110
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:57,720
make my YouTube videos

111
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:57,720
I work I'm gonna

112
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:04,050
have a dog actual

113
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:04,050
job I work for Home

114
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:05,700
Video and so it's all

115
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,700
and the nighttime

116
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:07,440
like everything's in

117
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,440
the night time and

118
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:11,070
I was just really

119
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:11,070
exhausted so I took

120
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,720
like a personal break

121
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,720
it's just like it

122
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:18,570
was only supposed to

123
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:18,570
be like a week or

124
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:20,280
two okay and then

125
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,280
like before I even

126
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:23,100
took the personal

127
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:23,100
break I was having

128
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:25,410
like a lot of trouble

129
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,410
with like being

130
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,990
creative like I wasn't

131
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,990
focused you know

132
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:30,510
I wasn't focused I

133
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,510
was having lack of

134
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:36,420
creativity I was just

135
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:36,420
the energy was it

136
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:38,280
I'd like to there and

137
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,280
like I don't know

138
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:41,460
why but I think it's

139
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:41,460
mainly because of

140
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,930
my focus I wasn't

141
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,930
really carefully so

142
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,610
that could have been

143
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,610
definitely why I

144
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,560
know it's also in my

145
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,560
head about a lot of

146
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:48,840
the things like I

147
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,840
just felt like I

148
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,740
started my channel

149
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,740
give me a teal pause

150
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:56,750
but I did I didn't

151
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:56,750
shut it oh this did

152
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,750
you guys see that inter

153
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:07,950
I'm saying her name

154
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:07,950
right I think it's

155
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:12,600
Jade janae Shana or

156
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:12,600
Jade Shana la gun I

157
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:14,580
was gonna put her on

158
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:14,580
yeah I'm just gonna

159
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,530
put her at name on

160
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,530
the screen because

161
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:19,860
she really did that okay

162
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:21,480
the like I was just

163
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,480
first thing is that

164
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,770
I felt like I've

165
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:22,770
been on YouTube for

166
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,920
about two years now

167
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:30,810
and I didn't have

168
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:30,810
like a really dope

169
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:33,720
intro I I don't have

170
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,720
a camera like I'm

171
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:39,120
still using my phone

172
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:39,120
like I don't have

173
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:40,860
like this super amazing

174
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,860
hobby but what

175
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,360
do you say editing

176
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,360

183
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:53,340
please just ignore it

184
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:55,650
I was in my head about

185
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,650
a lot of things

186
00:05:53,340 --> 00:06:00,540
those really comparing

187
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:00,540
myself to a lot

188
00:05:55,650 --> 00:06:02,610
of other people stuff

189
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:02,610
and then it was

190
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:04,290
really yeah time

191
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,290
like an impact on my

192
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:06,510
creativity like I

193
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,510
wasn't focused about

194
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:09,300
what shine I wanted

195
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,300
to do I was kind of

196
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:10,500
like doing what was

197
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,500
in or what was the

198
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,080
trend so I had to

199
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:13,080
really take a step

200
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,880
back and we focus

201
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,880

226
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:42,150

00:06:56,929 --> 00:06:58,680
I just really had

243
00:06:56,939 --> 00:07:02,129
to take a step back

244
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:02,129
and remind myself

245
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,930

247
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:05,699
that you want to

248
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,699
accomplish what is that

249
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:07,800
you love about YouTube

250
00:07:05,689 --> 00:07:07,800
I really have to

251
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:08,969
fall in love with

252
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:08,969
YouTube again so if I

253
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,620
haven't responded to any of your

254
00:07:08,969 --> 00:07:12,180
comments or anything

255
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,180
it's because I

256
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,699
haven't been on my

257
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,699
own YouTube channel

258
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,889
like I was so disappointed

259
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:16,889
in myself for

260
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:19,379
not being consistent

261
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:19,379
that I wasn't even

262
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:21,900
on my own channel

263
00:07:19,369 --> 00:07:21,900
like I logged out of

264
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:23,309
my own nose using

265
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,309
my older weather's

266
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,259
tonight like personal

267
00:07:23,299 --> 00:07:25,259
personal account

268
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:27,649
not mine that's so

269
00:07:25,249 --> 00:07:27,649
shy account and

270
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:30,360
that's goes to show

271
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:30,360
you guys like how

272
00:07:27,649 --> 00:07:35,669
how much I felt bad

273
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:35,669
because it's like I

274
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:37,199
came you guys started

275
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:37,199
getting like

276
00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:38,969
attached to me

277
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:38,969
whatever and I just

278
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,800
disappeared and

279
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,800
like I thought well

280
00:07:38,969 --> 00:07:43,169
because you guys

281
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:43,169
don't deserve that

282
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,870
we rock it together

283
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:45,870
so I should come

284
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:47,069
here and be like fully

285
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,069
transparent with

286
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:50,039
you which is what I'm

287
00:07:47,059 --> 00:07:50,039
gonna try and do

288
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:52,589
this video I want

289
00:07:50,029 --> 00:07:52,589
to be bullying some

290
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:54,389
things aren't fully

291
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:54,389
dealt with or

292
00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:56,069
finished so I can't

293
00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:56,069
fully talk about

294
00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:58,169
them yet because I'm

295
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:58,169
just one of those

296
00:07:56,069 --> 00:07:59,550
people that feel

297
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:59,550
like sometimes you

298
00:07:58,169 --> 00:08:02,819
can't put all of your

299
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,819
goals and dreams

300
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:09,270
out there because

301
00:08:02,809 --> 00:08:09,270
but mine is I real

302
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:12,029
something it's real

303
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:12,029
so I just feel like

304
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:16,709
I just can't as yet

305
00:08:12,019 --> 00:08:16,709
and then another

306
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:18,810
thing it was just like

307
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:18,810
shine has to take

308
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:22,169
care of Cheyenne I'm

309
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,169
just like a person

310
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:25,020
in that leg well I

311
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:25,020
don't really sleep on

312
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:27,539
the regular but like

313
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,539
I'll compromise

314
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:29,610
sleep to do anything

315
00:08:27,529 --> 00:08:29,610
and everything like

316
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:31,020
it was really about

317
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,020
like self care like

318
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,519

00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,519
like a self care

320
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,919
moment because there

322
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:39,779

then I'll send the

347
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,730
week back so I don't

00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,590
provide Harriet below

349
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,590
it but like yeah I

350
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:15,080
had to take some time

351
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:15,080
to focus on that

352
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:17,390
because and my

353
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:17,390
life balance is so

354
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:19,940
important when things

355
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,940
are unbalanced I'm

356
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:22,040
a whole mess like a

357
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:22,040
complete wreck and I

358
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:24,230
don't know what's

359
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,230
going on at all so I

360
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,910
needed to find that

361
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,910
balance and I know

362
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,770
that I needed to find

363
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,770
that balance but I

364
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:29,180
wasn't focused on

365
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,180
finding that balance

366
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:31,400
because there was so

367
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,400
many other things

368
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:33,530
going on that I was

369
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:33,530
distracted so I

370
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:37,340
could have found the

371
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:37,340
balance earlier but

372
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:39,710
I I did it like I

373
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:39,710
like life hits you

374
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:42,650
sometimes like frickin Tom seems

375
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:47,420
sometimes like at

376
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,420
the same time like

377
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:51,770
during all that after

378
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:51,770
like my birthday

379
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:55,370
vlog I also come back

380
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,370
and like be fully

381
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:57,440
active on YouTube

382
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,440
but like my spirits

383
00:09:55,370 --> 00:10:01,610
weren't high like I wasn't a

384
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:04,130
happy-go-lucky you

385
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,130
know positive shine

386
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:07,790
and like I I'm known

387
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,790
to be or who I

388
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:09,920
actually am I wasn't

389
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,920
like I just wasn't

390
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:12,050
in a good mental

391
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,050
space and I really

392
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,720
needed to like I was

393
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,720
focusing on getting

394
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:16,940
back into a good place

395
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,940
but then it boom

396
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:22,040
something else I was

397
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:22,040
going through a

398
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:23,270
breakup after that

399
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,270
and that was a lot

400
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,339
because I was in a

401
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,339
relationship for a

402
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:28,790
very long time and

403
00:10:25,329 --> 00:10:28,790
I definitely love

404
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:30,350
this person a lot

405
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,350
and like you know

406
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:34,880
things don't work I

407
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:34,880
was the point think

408
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:38,360
things happen and

409
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:38,360
stuff and I was going

410
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:41,180
through that and like

411
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:41,180
I was like I was

412
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,800
just emotionally

413
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,800
unstable you see and

414
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:44,900
say at that point

415
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,900
that makes it seem

416
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,950
crazy but like not

417
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:45,950
that it just wasn't

418
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,210
for me

419
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:50,120
and I'm not the

420
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,120
person to come on

421
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:52,760
YouTube and fake about

422
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:52,760
how great my life

423
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,740
is when it really

424
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,740
isn't I I just can't

425
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:58,310
fake smile I can't

426
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:58,310
fake do anything I

427
00:10:54,740 --> 00:11:02,450
can't fake laugh like

428
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:02,450
if I do anything

429
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:05,160
I'd do it because I

430
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,160
want to and my heart

431
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:08,759
is in it i'ma with all my

432
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:10,350
hardtack person Mike

433
00:11:08,749 --> 00:11:10,350
and I love you I

434
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:11,759
love you with all my

435
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,759
heart I hate you I

436
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,139
hate you with all my

437
00:11:11,749 --> 00:11:13,139
heart I think you

438
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:14,699
that's just who I am

439
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:17,269
sometimes it's um

440
00:11:14,689 --> 00:11:17,269
that's what like one

441
00:11:14,699 --> 00:11:19,319
of my really bad traits

442
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:22,050
negative traits cuz

443
00:11:19,309 --> 00:11:22,050
if I don't like it I

444
00:11:19,319 --> 00:11:23,550
don't like you like

445
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,550
if I was just not in

446
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:24,870
a good space and shy

447
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,870
and had to take

448
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,100
care of shine because

449
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,100
her shine doesn't

450
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:29,310
take care of shine

451
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:29,310
who's gonna take care

452
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,660
of her right and I

453
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,660
really feel like a

454
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:33,449
lot of the time you

455
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:33,449
talk about like

456
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:35,879
self-care and our

457
00:11:33,439 --> 00:11:35,879
mental health and

458
00:11:33,449 --> 00:11:37,560
stuff but we really

459
00:11:35,869 --> 00:11:37,560
don't take it

460
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:39,629
seriously until you're

461
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,629
actually in that

462
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:42,180
point another update

463
00:11:39,619 --> 00:11:42,180
I'm not in school

464
00:11:39,629 --> 00:11:43,350
at the moment I

465
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,350
took a semester off

466
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:46,529

just been working

469
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:47,970
making wigs and that

470
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:49,470
basically takes up

471
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,470
my whole entire time

472
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:50,910
and then I have like

473
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,910
you know I tried to

474
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:52,410
make time to hang out

475
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,410

took some time off

479
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:56,699
school because I

480
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:59,519
wasn't motivated

481
00:11:56,689 --> 00:11:59,519
like I wanted to I

482
00:11:56,699 --> 00:12:02,480
wasn't motivated about

483
00:11:59,509 --> 00:12:02,480
anything I wasn't

484
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:05,189
motivated of hope

485
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:05,189
and you think like

486
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,459
first of all school

487
00:12:05,179 --> 00:12:08,459
and then it was like

488
00:12:05,189 --> 00:12:10,589
YouTube stuff then

489
00:12:08,449 --> 00:12:10,589

in school I wanted

496
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:18,149
to spend the time to

497
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,149
fall back in love

498
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:20,550

00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:26,279
important because

00:12:22,579 --> 00:12:26,279

504
00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:27,569

my life it just caused

511
00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:35,009
me a whole bunch

512
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:36,420
of being society um

513
00:12:34,999 --> 00:12:36,420
academia and a whole

514
00:12:35,009 --> 00:12:38,550
bunch of damaged

515
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:38,550
stress and depression

516
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:40,829

00:12:40,819 --> 00:12:43,079
really understand

520
00:12:40,829 --> 00:12:45,240
why I was just very

521
00:12:43,069 --> 00:12:45,240
unhappy plus my

522
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:51,209
school went on strike

523
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:51,209

up my vacation

526
00:12:51,209 --> 00:12:56,819
line to think of

527
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,819

being Cheyenne I'm

536
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:14,490
learning me but I think

537
00:13:10,009 --> 00:13:14,490
it's been a good

538
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:16,830
time like I've honestly

539
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,830
understood why

540
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:19,320
school is important

541
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,320
while not being

542
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:21,750
school the job right

543
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,750
now that I have is

544
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,730
like I hate it so

545
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,730
much that I would

546
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:26,640
never want to work

547
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,640
here and actually be

548
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:28,680
my job so it's important

549
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,680
that I go out

550
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,420
there and I go and get

551
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,420

for the rest of my

556
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:35,760
life that is like

557
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:35,760
the most important

558
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,250
thing to me that I'm

559
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,250
doing what I love

560
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,300

doing I'm helping

564
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:44,250
people that is what

565
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,250
I want to do within

566
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:47,700
this period I've just

567
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,700
been learning to

568
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:51,660
be a little bit more

569
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:51,660
selfish put shine

570
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:55,560
like first over

571
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:55,560
things that don't

572
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:58,080
necessarily matter or

573
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:58,080
deserve that space

574
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:00,510
of where shine should

575
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,510
be it's just like

576
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:03,420

00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:06,540
want some I think it

580
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:08,160
was all about me right

581
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,160
now in the place

582
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,270
that I am right now

583
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,270
in my life I feel

584
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,590
like you guys probably think I'm

585
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:12,330
rambling and I'm

586
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,330
talking about nothing

587
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:14,430
but this just this

588
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,430
is just where I am

589
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:16,830
like I don't know

590
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,830
fully where I'm going

591
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:19,200
I don't fully know

592
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,200

myself it's you gotta

605
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:37,260

607
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:41,730
like I don't know

608
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:43,470
it's just so in Blake

609
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,470

610
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:47,070

kickin pushing and

617
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:56,340
yeah that's it

618
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,900
there's also another

619
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,900
reason why not in

620
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:59,940
school but I won't

621
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,940
say that until it's

622
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,950
done and that would

623
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,950
be like a whole

624
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,480
video on my stupidity

625
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,480
period this

626
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:07,560
discovery period that

627
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:07,560
I'm going through

628
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:09,240
there's a lot that

629
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,240
will change and I

630
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,920
will have to accept

631
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,920
because I'm one of

632
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:16,490
those people that

633
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:16,490
don't like change

634
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:16,490
these are times

635
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:27,029
like to do risky and

636
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:27,029
fun and dumb things

637
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:28,860
but just because

638
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:28,860
like I've never like

639
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:31,290
it's the high that

640
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:31,290
it gives me but like

641
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:34,230
changing my whole

642
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,230
life or like opening

643
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:35,449
up some new people

644
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,449
and whatnot it's not

645
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:39,449
really my thing

646
00:15:35,449 --> 00:15:42,540
sadness struggling

647
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:42,540
with accepting teens

648
00:15:39,449 --> 00:15:45,029
and understanding it

649
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:45,029
because it's part

650
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:47,250
of life and I have

651
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:47,250
to accept it when it

652
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:53,100
comes my weight whether

653
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:53,100
I like it or not

654
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:55,230
um I think I've

655
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,230
learned a lot through

656
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:58,920
this period so I will

657
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,920
