1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,069
hey everybody welcome

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:05,069
back to my channel

3
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:10,230
today's video is super

4
00:00:05,059 --> 00:00:10,230
exciting because

5
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:11,340
I am showing you guys

6
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,340
I'm sharing my DNA

7
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:16,410
results

8
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:18,330
I took a DNA test

9
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,330
turns up I got my

10
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:21,029
results back yesterday

11
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,029
so I actually

12
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:25,080
feel my reaction

13
00:00:21,019 --> 00:00:25,080
however the car ride

14
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:27,119
was just kind of like

15
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,119
bumpy and the mic

16
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,160
wasn't there like

17
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:29,160
it was just I don't

18
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,679
think the quality was

19
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,679
there so I decided

20
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,120
to sit down show you

21
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:33,120
guys my results

22
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,739
I'll go ahead and throw

23
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,739
in some clips in

24
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,840
my reaction because

25
00:00:34,729 --> 00:00:36,840
I was actually

26
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:39,090
pleasantly surprised

27
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:39,090
I was really happy

28
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,610
to take this test

29
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,610
because I really

30
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,770
wanted to find out

31
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,770
my ancestry I even

32
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,390
told so many different

33
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,390
things from both

34
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,809
sides of my family

35
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:48,809
that I'm just like

36
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:51,480
hmm let's put it to

37
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:51,480
the test so I went

38
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:53,940
ahead I gave the

39
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,940
government a now they

40
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,010
can clone me and

41
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,010
here we are with my

42
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:59,100
results as you can see

43
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,100
I'm here the baby

44
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,879
boy he just woke up

45
00:00:59,090 --> 00:00:59,879
from a nap and he

46
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,399
had some milk

47
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:03,870
so he is chillin right

48
00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:03,870
now so the very

49
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,750
first thing I really

50
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:06,750
wanted to start

51
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:09,510
with was my background my ethnic

52
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:12,090
background both of

53
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,090
my parents are mixed

54
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:16,979
my mom is mixed with

55
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,979
Egyptian and white

56
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:19,320
and my dad is mixed

57
00:01:16,969 --> 00:01:19,320
with black and white

58
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:22,290
he's mostly black

59
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:22,290
his mom was mixed

60
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:25,560
black and white but

61
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,560
his dad was black so

62
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:28,470
both my parents are

63
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:28,470
of mixed race right

64
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,630
off the bat I just

65
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,630
assumed that my DNA

66
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:33,299
results would come

67
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,299
back mostly African

68
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:35,729
European and I

69
00:01:33,289 --> 00:01:35,729
expected some Middle

70
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:38,670
Eastern as well

71
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:38,670
throughout my life I

72
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:41,070
have been told that

73
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:41,070
we are Jewish that

74
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,380
we're Native American

75
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,380
those are two

76
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,119
things that I have

77
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,119
been told from both

78
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,799
sides of my family

79
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:46,799
the Native American

80
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,290
from both sides and

81
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:49,290
then the Jewish from

82
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,630
my mom's mom my mom's

83
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,630
dad immigrated

84
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,909
from Egypt to the

85
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,909
United States my mom's

86
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,189
mom I'm pretty sure

87
00:01:53,899 --> 00:01:55,189
her family has been

88
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:57,180
here for generations

89
00:01:55,179 --> 00:01:57,180
and generations

90
00:01:55,189 --> 00:01:59,430
assume that my dad's

91
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,430
side of the family

92
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,659
is black I can assume

93
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,659
that they've also

94
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,880
been here for generations and

95
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:04,860
generations and

96
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,860
generations because of

97
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,290
the slave trade

98
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:07,290
that happened way

99
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,240
way back then so I

100
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,240
can only assume that

101
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:11,220
my relatives were

102
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,220
slaves I can also

103
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,890
assume that my

104
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,890
relatives may have

105
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,750
possibly been slave

106
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,750
owners and passed as

107
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,450
far as the Egyptians

108
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,450
side I don't really

109
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:20,310
know the Egyptian side

110
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,310
of my family when

111
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,870
people ask me what

112
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,870
I am I do say I'm

113
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:25,050
black white in Egyptian

114
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:25,050
because that's

115
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:27,750
exactly what I look

116
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,750
like but I actually

117
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:29,130
don't know Arabic

118
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,130
I don't know the

119
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,770
Egyptian culture I

120
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,770
don't know anything

121
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:33,570
about being egyptian

122
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,570
and I'm really

123
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:36,450
proud to be Egyptian

124
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,450
I think it's a

125
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:38,940
beautiful culture way

126
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,940
back from ancient

127
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,650
Egypt to current

128
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:40,650
date Egypt however I

129
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,840
don't know anything

130
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,840
about it I don't

131
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:45,060
know what it is to

132
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,060
be Egyptian all I

133
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,489
know is that I am

134
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:47,489
Egyptian my grandpa

135
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,860
came from Egypt and

136
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:49,860
I do wish I knew

137
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:51,989
more Arabic or any

138
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,989
Arabic for that

139
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,310
matter and I do wish

140
00:02:51,979 --> 00:02:53,310
I knew that side of

141
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:54,780
my family but I know

142
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,780
some of them are

143
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,850
still in Egypt and

144
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,850
some of them actually

145
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,280
live here in the

146
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,280
states I think in

147
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:01,140
Houston Texas I

148
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,140
just never met them

149
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,880
before and hopefully

150
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,880
one day I get to

151
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,010
meet them and then

152
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,010
I'll insert some

153
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,500
clips of my reaction

154
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,500
as well but right

155
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:08,459
now this is just an overview of

156
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,870
everything that I am

157
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:11,160
I've already seen these results

158
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:13,080
yesterday was the day

159
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,080
where I actually

160
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,670
had a reaction and I

161
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,670
did want to film it

162
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,320
and I couldn't wait

163
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,320
because I was just

164
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:18,239
super super excited I

165
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,239
wouldn't have been

166
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,549
home until about 9:00 p.m.

167
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:20,549
and I wasn't

168
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,799
gonna film around

169
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:22,799
that time either so

170
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:25,440
I'll just go ahead and

171
00:03:22,789 --> 00:03:25,440
insert some clips

172
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:38,459
of my reaction no

173
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:38,459
it is crapping his

174
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:40,530
pants right now sir

175
00:03:38,449 --> 00:03:40,530
now that that's

176
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:43,049
taken care of let's

177
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,049
get back into the

178
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:47,220
video I'm gonna go

179
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:47,220
ahead and share with

180
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:49,620
you guys all of my

181
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,620
percentages do the

182
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,880
breakdown and then

183
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:50,880
give you a little bit

184
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,760
of information on

185
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,760
some things that I

186
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:56,220
found really interesting

187
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,220
so the very

188
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,970
first thing that comes

189
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:59,970
up on my ancestry

190
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:02,730
or poor is European

191
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,730
I am a 38% European

192
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:05,340
30 0.3% of that is north western

193
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:07,079
European so British

194
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,079
an Irish French and

195
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:11,280
German and then

196
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:11,280
broadly North Western

197
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:14,819
European I know that

198
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:14,819
my dad's mom I'm

199
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:18,419
pretty sure I have

200
00:04:14,809 --> 00:04:18,419
been told that she is

201
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:21,599
Irish and then my mom's

202
00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:23,879
mom's mom so my

203
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:23,879
great-grandma on my

204
00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:26,639
mom's side I know

205
00:04:23,869 --> 00:04:26,639
that she was like

206
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:29,460
British and Irish 30

207
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:29,460
0.3% Northwestern

208
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:33,090
European now the other

209
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:33,090
European part of

210
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:37,199
me is 2.7 southern

211
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,199
European so that

212
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:40,340
includes Italy Malta

213
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:40,340
Spain Portugal and

214
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:48,029
in broadly southern

215
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:48,029
European wait 8%

216
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:50,400
Italian 0.2% Spanish

217
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:50,400
and porch I believe

218
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:53,219
it came from the

219
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,219
Egyptian side of my

220
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,539
family so if you

221
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,539
know geography you

222
00:04:53,219 --> 00:04:56,909
would know that

223
00:04:54,529 --> 00:04:56,909
the Mediterranean

224
00:04:54,539 --> 00:05:00,449
separates southern

225
00:04:56,899 --> 00:05:00,449
Europe in northern

226
00:04:56,909 --> 00:05:02,909
Africa and I honestly

227
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:02,909
believe that part

228
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:07,770
of our Egyptian

229
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:07,770
side is also like

230
00:05:02,909 --> 00:05:09,930
Italian or Spanish

231
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,930
Portuguese because

232
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:11,939
it's right across the

233
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,939
Mediterranean Sea

234
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:13,800
so that's what I can

235
00:05:11,929 --> 00:05:13,800
assume now it's

236
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:15,839
very possible that

237
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,839
it came from the

238
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,060
white sides of my

239
00:05:15,829 --> 00:05:18,060
family the people who

240
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:21,060
came from like Great

241
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:21,060
Britain and Ireland

242
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:24,089
and France and

243
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:24,089
Germany but I really

244
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:25,759
truly believe that

245
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:25,759
it did come from the

246
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:27,689
Egyptian side just because

247
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:31,169
geographically that

248
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:31,169
would make sense to

249
00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:33,990
me now I knew that

250
00:05:31,159 --> 00:05:33,990
most of my map would

251
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:35,879
cover Africa because

252
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,879
I know my dad is

253
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:39,719
black and I know my

254
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:39,719
mom's dad came from

255
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:42,599
Egypt so he is

256
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:42,599
African so I'm 34.2%

257
00:05:39,719 --> 00:05:44,909
sub-saharan African

258
00:05:42,589 --> 00:05:44,909
now that is a little

259
00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:48,029
bit less than how much your p.m.

260
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:48,029
it's

261
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:50,729
almost the same

262
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:50,729
amount but I am 26.8%

263
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:52,469
West African now if

264
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,469
you know anything

265
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:54,779
about the slave trade

266
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:54,779
you know that most

267
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:56,639
of the slaves did

268
00:05:54,769 --> 00:05:56,639
come from West Africa

269
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:59,909
so I can only assume

270
00:05:56,629 --> 00:05:59,909
that my ancestors

271
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:03,920
were slaves at one

272
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:03,920
point I am at 10.5%

273
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:07,570
Nigerian Nigeria

274
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:13,940
but 9.8% Ghanian

275
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:13,940
liberia and sierra

276
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:17,840
leonean see ya Leone I am 1.3%

277
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:20,210
Senegambia n-- and

278
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:20,210
Guinean I'm 5.2

279
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,130
percent broadly West

280
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,130
African so like I

281
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:24,800
said I believe that

282
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,800
West African came

283
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:27,470
from the slave trade

284
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:27,470
and my ancestors

285
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,970
who were more than

286
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,970
likely slaves and

287
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:32,480
then I saw that I'm 5.1 percent

288
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:35,540
Congolese and southern

289
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:35,540
East African now

290
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:37,640
I don't know what

291
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:37,640
that came from my

292
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:39,380
dad's side of the

293
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,380
family who is African

294
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:42,110
American who is black

295
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:42,110
or if that came

296
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:45,650
from my mom's side of

297
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,650
the family because

298
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:48,020
it is south of the

299
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,020
Sudan but you gypped

300
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:50,930
is north of the Sudan

301
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:50,930
and it's North

302
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:53,450
East Africa I would

303
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,450
say on a map it

304
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:55,340
looks like North

305
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,340
East Africa and so I

306
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:59,420
don't know if any of

307
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:59,420
this East African

308
00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:01,310
came from my mom's

309
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:01,310
dad side of the

310
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:04,490
family or my dad's

311
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,490
side of the family

312
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:06,680
and he has African

313
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,680
ancestry on both his

314
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,280
mom and dad side so

315
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:07,280
I'm not sure where

316
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,440
that came from

317
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,720
but I feel like that

318
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,720
came from my mom's

319
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,850
side I knew that most

320
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,850
of my map would be

321
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,220
covered would cover

322
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,220
like all of Africa

323
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:18,860
technically because

324
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,860
I'm from both North

325
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:22,100
Africa and sub-saharan Africa

326
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:25,010
and so here it says

327
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:25,010
I'm 24.9% Western

328
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:26,360
Asian and North

329
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,360
African twenty-three

330
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:28,940
point three percent

331
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,940
of that is Arab

332
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,820
Egyptian and Levantine

333
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:31,820
seventeen point

334
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:33,530
six percent of that

335
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,530
is Egyptian three

336
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:35,450
point five percent

337
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,450
of X coptic egyptian

338
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:37,910
and two point two

339
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,910
percent of that is

340
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:39,650
broadly Arab Egyptian

341
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,650
and Levantine says

342
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:42,500
three point five

343
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,500
percent of my ancestry

344
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:44,390
is coptic egyptian

345
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:44,390
so it says making up

346
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:46,970
over ten percent of

347
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,970
Egypt's population

348
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:48,920
cops are Christian

349
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,920
minority who share in

350
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:51,230
ancient history with non Coptic

351
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:53,990
Egyptians that dates

352
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,990
back before the

353
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:55,490
first Pharaohs however

354
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,490
after the seventh

355
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:57,470
century of conquest

356
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,470
of Egypt by the

357
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:59,210
ration and Caliphate

358
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,210
the Christian cops

359
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:00,740
began to become

360
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,740
genetically distinct

361
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:02,810
from the Muslim

362
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,810
majority population

363
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:05,000
while the Coptic

364
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,000
language was replaced

365
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:07,400
by Egyptian Arabic

366
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:07,400
outside of a strictly

367
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,020
religious setting

368
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,020
today most cops live

369
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,700
in Egypt or Sudan

370
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,700
but there are also

371
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:13,220
large Coptic communities

372
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,220
living in the

373
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,800
United States Australia

374
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:14,800
and Canada so I

375
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,820
thought that was

376
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,820
pretty interesting and

377
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,340
if I'm translating

378
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:21,920
correctly I think it

379
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,920
means that like the

380
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:24,050
coptic egyptian is

381
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:24,050
like the egyptians

382
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:27,860
who were there like

383
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,860
way before like King

384
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:29,960
Tut which i think is

385
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,960
awesome what if I'm

386
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:33,590
related to like King

387
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:33,590
Tut or Nefertiti

388
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:36,320
and going back to my ancestry

389
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:38,270
composition it says

390
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:38,270
that I am 0.4% North

391
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,580
African and then one

392
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,580
point two percent

393
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:42,770
broadly Western Asian

394
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:42,770
and North African

395
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:47,960
the Western Asian I

396
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:47,960
can assume that it's

397
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:50,570
like hi I'm one

398
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:50,570
point two percent

399
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:54,320
broadly Western Asian

400
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,320
and North African

401
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:55,670
and then 0.4% North

402
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,670
African and I can

403
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,760
assume that's just

404
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,760
like the rest of

405
00:08:55,670 --> 00:09:00,740
North Africa like

406
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,740
Morocco Libya and the

407
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,640
Western Asian part

408
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:01,640
would be Middle

409
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:04,610
Eastern

410
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:08,360
so I think that that's

411
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,360
what that means

412
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:10,700
again correct me if

413
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,700
I am wrong if I go

414
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:13,040
to trace ancestry it

415
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:13,040
says I'm point nine

416
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:17,330
percent trace

417
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:17,330
ancestry I think that

418
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:18,860
means just Native

419
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,860
American maybe because

420
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:21,200
it says I'm point

421
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,200
four percent Native

422
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:23,210
American and then

423
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,210
I'm point three

424
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,070
percent broadly southern

425
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,070
South Asian and

426
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:28,100
point two percent

427
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:28,100
broadly Central and

428
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:29,720
South Asian which

429
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,720
means like Sri Lanka

430
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:32,480
and India which I

431
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:32,480
thought was pretty

432
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:34,250
cool those are my

433
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,250
results I think that

434
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:38,330
it is beautiful I'm

435
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,330
from all of these

436
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:39,770
different cultures

437
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,770
and countries ton of

438
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:42,710
anything I'm just

439
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,710
like a little bit of

440
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:44,450
everything within

441
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,450
those countries so I

442
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:46,870
think it's awesome

443
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,870
I'm really really

444
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:49,640
happy that I got to

445
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,640
do this test because

446
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:51,740
again I just wanted

447
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,740
to know more about

448
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,960
my ancestry and this

449
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,960
was a perfect way

450
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:57,140
to find out so I did

451
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:57,140
take the 23andme

452
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:59,600
DNA test and I got

453
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,600
my results back in

454
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:01,490
like three weeks

455
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,490
super super easy but

456
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,890
something I did want

457
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,890
to point out was I

458
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:05,180
was told in my family

459
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,180
that we are like

460
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:08,150
both sides my family have Native

461
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:10,130
American and then my

462
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,130
mom said my family

463
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:12,050
has Jewish no I don't

464
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,050
know where they

465
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:16,790
got that from because

466
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:16,790
I don't see any

467
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:19,130
Jewish on here at all

468
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,130
like at all like

469
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:21,220
there's no Jewish in

470
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,220
fact if I go into

471
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:23,630
another report it

472
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,630
says they're 0.0%

473
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:27,680
Ashkenazi Jewish

474
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:27,680
which is what I was

475
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:29,400
told that we are so

476
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,400
I don't know but it

477
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:33,810
doesn't say anything

478
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:33,810
about being Jewish

479
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:35,130
here at 0.4% Native

480
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,130
American and I don't

481
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:37,110
know where what side

482
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,110
of my family that

483
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,830
comes from I don't

484
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:37,830
know anything about

485
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,180
that

486
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:40,589
I just know that I

487
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,589
was told I'm more

488
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:43,770
Native American than that like I

489
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:45,870
expected maybe like

490
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,870
15 percent Native

491
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:48,029
American I just want

492
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,029
to know like where

493
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:50,160
my family heard

494
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:50,160
this stuff or did

495
00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:53,640
somebody just make

496
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,640
it up like I don't

497
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:56,580
know but I'm a smidge

498
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:56,580
Native American

499
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:58,500
and not Jewish at all

500
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:58,500
so that was kind

501
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:00,650
of surprising but

502
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,650
other than that my

503
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,660
tests were pretty

504
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,660
accurate to what I

505
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:05,970
expected them to be

506
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:05,970
I love it I think

507
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:08,010
it's so cool I'm so

508
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,010
glad than I know

tell me what your

513
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:13,200
results were if they

514
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,200
were accurate if

515
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:14,820
they shocked you if

516
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,820
they were exactly

517
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,980

518
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,980
