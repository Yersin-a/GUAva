00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:13,830
today's video is going to be my

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,870
pregnancy Q&A I'm

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,870
really excited to film

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,480
this video and first

7
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,480
I want to give a

8
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,609
shout out to everybody

9
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,609
who participated

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,869
in my Instagram

11
00:00:20,599 --> 00:00:21,869
polls and sent me

12
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:23,850
questions for this video

13
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:25,140
I'm really excited

14
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,140
like I said to answer

15
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,689
the questions I'm

16
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,689
just going to hop

17
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,400
right into the video

18
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:29,400
so I have been

19
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:31,650
needing to literally

20
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,650
write everything

21
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,540
down like I have it

22
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,540
all on my phone and

23
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,520
screenshot it and

24
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,520
everything but writing

25
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:39,360
things down makes it

26
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:39,360
so much easier for

27
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,100
me as far as these

28
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:41,100
types of videos go so

29
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,660
you can see every

30
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:42,660
what pregnancy Q&A

31
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,690
that I've done all

32
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:45,690
the questions that

33
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:48,000
everybody asked me

34
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,000
very first question

35
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,770
that I got is from one

36
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,770
of my friends she

37
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,899
said what were your

38
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,899
first symptoms

39
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:55,649
before you knew you

40
00:00:51,889 --> 00:00:55,649
were pregnant so I

41
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:58,140
actually didn't have

42
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:58,140
any symptoms as far

43
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:59,609
as like pregnancy

44
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:59,609
symptoms ago before I

45
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,770
knew I was pregnant like all the

46
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:03,690
symptoms and everything

47
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,690
happened after I

48
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,549
found out so about the

49
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,549
time that I found

50
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:08,100
out that I was

51
00:01:05,539 --> 00:01:08,100
pregnant I was having

52
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:10,229
like period symptoms

53
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,229
because I was due

54
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:13,439
for my period now

55
00:01:10,219 --> 00:01:13,439
my periods like

56
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:15,420
normally like really

57
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:15,420
really regular so I

58
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,060
thought nothing of

59
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:18,060
it like the cramps

60
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,590
that I was having the

61
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,590
exhaustion none of

62
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:24,659
that was just like

63
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:24,659
out of the ordinary

64
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:28,110
for me um ma'am where's

65
00:01:24,649 --> 00:01:28,110
your bone kkona

66
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:32,790
kkona where's your

67
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:32,790
bone what'd you go

68
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:36,479
find it so none of

69
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,479
the cramping or any

70
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,920
of the exhaustion or

71
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:37,920
like sore boobs was

72
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,140
anything like out

73
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:40,140
of the ordinary

74
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,210
because that's normally

75
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:42,210
what I get on my

76
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,799
period anyways it

77
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,799
just seemed like a

78
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,350
period to me so

79
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:46,350
that's what I thought

80
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,119
was coming yeah I

81
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,119
didn't really have or

82
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,590
noticed any other

83
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:49,590
pregnancy symptoms

84
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:51,509
until after I found

85
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,509
out I was pregnant

86
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,729
the second question

87
00:01:51,499 --> 00:01:53,729
says how does it

88
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:56,369
feel what kinds of

89
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:56,369
cravings do you get

90
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:58,409
so as far as the

91
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:58,409
first part of that

92
00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:00,180
question how does it

93
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,180
feel I think it's

94
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:02,880
always going to be

95
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,880
to each their own

96
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,860
like how I feel in my

97
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,860
pregnancy is gonna

98
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,909
be way different

99
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,909
than how one of my

100
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,819
friends or anybody

101
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:09,819
else out there is an

102
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:11,739
feel during their

103
00:02:09,809 --> 00:02:11,739
pregnancy so as far as

104
00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:14,709
how it feels personally for me

105
00:02:11,739 --> 00:02:18,790
right now I just feel

106
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:18,790
like I don't have

107
00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:20,769
enough skin for my

108
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,769
growing tummy and I'm

109
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:24,340
really hungry at the

110
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:24,340
moment like I'm

111
00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:27,640
always always hungry

112
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,640
I'll leave a giant

113
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:29,560
meal and then an

114
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,560
hour later I'll be

115
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:33,160
starving again and

116
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:33,160
I wake up really

117
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:35,049
hungry so I haven't

118
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,049
had any like strange

119
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:38,170
cravings this is all

120
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,170
stuff I've always

121
00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:40,900
liked pre-pregnancy I

122
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,900
just really really

123
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:43,269
really like them now

124
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,269
so my first craving

125
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,709
is pickles sounds

126
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:44,709
pretty clichÃ© but

127
00:02:43,269 --> 00:02:46,840
pickles are like

128
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:46,840
one of my favorite

129
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:49,390
snacks I just love the

130
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,390
crunch I love the

131
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,790
taste I grew up

132
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,790
eating pickles I was

133
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:53,319
born in Kansas and I

134
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,319
feel like it's like

135
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,450
a Midwest thing to

136
00:02:53,309 --> 00:02:55,450
just kind of like

137
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:58,150
grow up eating pickles

138
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,150
like that I don't

139
00:02:55,450 --> 00:03:01,090
know if that's just

140
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,090
me or anything but

141
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:02,859
my husband hates

142
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,859
pickles and I know if

143
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:04,810
it goes are like all

144
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,810
over the world but

145
00:03:02,859 --> 00:03:07,120
I feel like it's like

146
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,120
a Midwest thing to

147
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:09,220
kind of just like

148
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,220
grow up eating lots

149
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,430
and lots of pickles

150
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:12,430
my second craving is

151
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:15,609
mango Navas they are

152
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,609
like a mango ice

153
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:17,290
cream which MO and I

154
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,290
mean I also like I

155
00:03:15,609 --> 00:03:19,989

156
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,989

158
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:22,209
as well as fruit

159
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:25,120

160
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:25,120
acai smoothies every

161
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:27,220
single day I add fresh

162
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,220
strawberries or

163
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,209

168
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:35,859
like cucumbers so

169
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:38,019
every day almost

170
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:38,019
every day I eat this

171
00:03:35,859 --> 00:03:40,599
like cucumber salad

172
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,599
with avocados and

173
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:43,120
red onions and for

174
00:03:40,589 --> 00:03:43,120
the dressing one of

175
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:45,190
the cravings is

176
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,190
actually olive oil and

177
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,480
lemon juice mixed

178
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,480
together that's

179
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:48,760
definitely one of

180
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,760
my cravings that I

181
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,790

00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,799
delicious and so I

184
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,799
mix that in with my

185
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:56,139
cucumbers and my

186
00:03:53,789 --> 00:03:56,139

00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,720
container but it's

203
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:18,720
so good and it's so worth

204
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:20,930
penny that I spend

205
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:20,930
on it so the next

206
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,010
question my little

207
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,010
sister asked me and

208
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:25,230
the way she typed it

209
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,230
didn't really make

210
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:27,330
sense that I just kind

211
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,330
of reworded it so

212
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:29,820
it says do you feel

213
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,820
weird having a belly

214
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:32,730
since you've always

215
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,730
been skinny honestly

216
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:34,880
yes I'm so used to

217
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,880
be able and being

218
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:40,080
able to wear like crop tops and

219
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:42,960
high-waisted denim

220
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,960
pants and now I can

221
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,040
only wear leggings

222
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,040
and t-shirts because

223
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,760
that's the only thing

224
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:44,760
that's comfortable

225
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,920
for me right now

226
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,500
so yeah I've pretty

227
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,500
much always been

228
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:53,220
skinny my entire life

229
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:53,220
in fact I'm still

230
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:55,050
really skinny for

231
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,050
someone who is almost

232
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:59,580
6 months pregnant

233
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,580
pre pregnancy I was

234
00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:01,170
about like 107 pounds

235
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,170
and then I lost

236
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:04,140
some weight in my

237
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,140
first trimester cuz I

238
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:06,210
didn't want to eat

239
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:06,210
anything and then in

240
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:10,140
my second trimester

241
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,140
I was fine so I

242
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:12,540
gained about like 5

243
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,540
pounds again and

244
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:14,610
then now I'm up to

245
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,610
120 pounds this

246
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,410
question says did you

247
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,410
have boy and girl

248
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:19,530
names ready to go

249
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,530
before you found out

250
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:22,350
the gender yes

251
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,350
basically I did have a

252
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:25,230
few names picked out

253
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,230
for boy and girl I

254
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:26,940
think now that I

255
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,940
have the boy name

256
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:29,790
settled I think I

257
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,790
have a girl name

258
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:32,040
settled too so in the

259
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,040
future whenever we

260
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:33,450
have a daughter

261
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,450
hopefully I still like

262
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,340
that name and we can

263
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,340
give her that name

264
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:36,780
this question says

265
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,780
what's the hardest

266
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:39,240
part about being

267
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,240
pregnant and what's the

268
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:42,870
easiest I think the

269
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:42,870
hardest part about

270
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,220
being pregnant is

271
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,220
waking up and not

272
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:46,830
knowing how I'm going

273
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,830
to feel for the

274
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:49,590
day so even though

275
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,590
I am in my second

276
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:51,540
trimester and

277
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,540
normally this is the

278
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:54,840
trimester when you

279
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:54,840
do feel pretty good

280
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:57,390
and pretty energetic

281
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:57,390
I still kind of

282
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,950
wake up not knowing

283
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,950
exactly how I'm

284
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:01,320
gonna feel for the

285
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,320
day like sometimes

286
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:04,290
I'm a little bit

287
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:04,290
cranky ER or sometimes

288
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:06,450
I'm extra extra hungry

289
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,450
which causes need

290
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:08,520
to be a little cranky

291
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,520
err or sometimes

292
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:11,220
I'm just really not

293
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,220
feeling good there's

294
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:14,970
just all these little

295
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:14,970
things that go on

296
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:16,740
that I can't really

297
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,740
help so I think

298
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:19,280
that's the hardest

299
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,280
part about pregnancy

300
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:21,780
is the easiest part

301
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,780
of pregnancy is

302
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,630
definitely the second

303
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,630
trimester first

304
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:26,240
trimester was horrible

305
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,240
it was awful we

306
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:29,690
went on vacation and I think

307
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,759
like one nap and we

308
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,759
were up pretty early

309
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:33,560
in the morning and

310
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:33,560
staying up pretty

311
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,509
late and I think I

312
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:35,509
only took one nap my

313
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,220
entire vacation so

314
00:06:35,499 --> 00:06:37,220
that was like the

315
00:06:35,509 --> 00:06:39,349
easiest part is just

316
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,349
like that spark of

317
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:41,419
energy that I got

318
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:41,419
there's like a few

319
00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:43,340
questions like a few

320
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:43,340
people asked me how

321
00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:45,080
did I find out I was

322
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,080
pregnant and did I

323
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,610
surprise my husband

324
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,610
did he already know

325
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,220
how did I break the

326
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,220
news to him so I'm

327
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:52,160
gonna combine those

328
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,160
two because it's

329
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:54,530
kind of like kind of

330
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,530
a story I guess so

331
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,419
at first I honestly

332
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,419
didn't think that I

333
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:58,400
was pregnant my husband

334
00:06:56,409 --> 00:06:58,400
was the one who

335
00:06:56,419 --> 00:07:00,440
was like I think

336
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,440
you're pregnant only

337
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,840
because my period

338
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,840
wasn't coming like I

339
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:05,720
said earlier in this

340
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,720
video my periods

341
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:07,430
are pretty regular so

342
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,430
for me to not have

343
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,139
my period there was

344
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,139
obviously just

345
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:11,180
something off but I

346
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:11,180
was just being in

347
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:12,590
denial about it I was

348
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,590
like no that can't

349
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,479
happen to me like

350
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,479
I'm not pregnant

351
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:17,000
there's no way and

352
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:17,000
then one day on his

353
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,889
way home from work

354
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,889
he brought me home

355
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,479
some pregnancy test

356
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:20,479
so I took them and I

357
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:22,009
was really confused

358
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:22,009
they were the ones

359
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,780
with like the lines

360
00:07:21,999 --> 00:07:23,780
you have like your

361
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:26,449
control line and we

362
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:26,449
have your test line

363
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:28,610
and my control line

364
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:28,610
was lighter than my

365
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:30,139
test line and I was

366
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,139
really confused

367
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:33,440
so that made me

368
00:07:30,129 --> 00:07:33,440
even more in denial

369
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:37,280
about me being

370
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:37,280
pregnant I was like so

371
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:40,580
why is my control line

372
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:40,580
light but my test

373
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:43,219
line is extremely

374
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:43,219
dark and it turns out

375
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:44,539
my HCG levels I think

376
00:07:43,209 --> 00:07:44,539
that's what it's

377
00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:45,949
called were just like

378
00:07:44,529 --> 00:07:45,949
really high like

379
00:07:44,539 --> 00:07:48,289
my hormone levels

380
00:07:45,939 --> 00:07:48,289
were really high

381
00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:50,690
apparently I had just

382
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:50,690
been pregnant for

383
00:07:48,289 --> 00:07:52,699
a while to reassure

384
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,699
myself I got one of

385
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:54,169
those like clear blue

386
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:54,169
digital ones that

387
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:56,539
say pregnant or not

388
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:56,539
pregnant and I took

389
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:59,449
it about I'm gonna say

390
00:07:56,529 --> 00:07:59,449
like a week later

391
00:07:56,539 --> 00:08:00,710
and sure enough I

392
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:00,710
was pregnant I did

393
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:02,360
take those tests

394
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,360
while my husband was

395
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:05,569
home like he knew I

396
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:05,569
was going to the

397
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:08,120
bathroom to take the

398
00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:08,120
test so when I was

399
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:10,610
done going to the

400
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,610
bathroom he would just

401
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,469
know to you know

402
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,469
come in and we would

403
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:14,419
just kind of watch the test stay

404
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:15,530
pregnant or not

405
00:08:14,409 --> 00:08:15,530
pregnant together so we

406
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:19,190
found out together

407
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,190
which I thought was

408
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:20,900
really special and

409
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,900
he was so excited it

410
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:22,310
was a cutest reaction

411
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,310
he hugged me and

412
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,680
he kissed me and I

413
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,680
would think I was

414
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:27,020
more shocked I was

415
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,020
like holy freaking

416
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,270
crap this is a joke

417
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:29,270
like there is no way

418
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:31,400
this is real this next

419
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,400
question says how

420
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:33,079
is the kicking and

421
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,079
kicking is actually

422
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,680
really interesting I

423
00:08:33,069 --> 00:08:33,680
started feeling the

424
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:35,779
baby kick

425
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,690
I was about 15 weeks

426
00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:38,690
pregnant and that's

427
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:40,700
really really early

428
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,700
for some people but

429
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:43,130
I've read that if

430
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:43,130
you're like really

431
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:45,320
tiny and petite like

432
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,320
I am you can start

433
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:46,760
feeling the baby earlier

434
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:46,760
pretty much the

435
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,220
kid hasn't stopped

436
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,220
moving since then

437
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:51,110
like I feel him all

438
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,110
the time my husband

439
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:53,029
was like what does

440
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,029
it feel like and

441
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:54,860
there was no other

442
00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:54,860
way to describe it

443
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:56,420
other than someone

444
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:56,420
being inside of you

445
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,950
and literally kicking

446
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,950
you which is

447
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,930
literally exactly

448
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,930
what's happening

449
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:02,209
that's the only way

450
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,209
I could describe it

451
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:04,430
the next question

452
00:09:02,199 --> 00:09:04,430
says what are some

453
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:06,020
names you like but

454
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,020
aren't using I think

455
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:06,830
want to do a video on

456
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:06,830
that so stay tuned

457
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,810
for that

458
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,890
this question says

459
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,890
at what point in

460
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:13,250
pregnancy did you

461
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,250
have to buy new

462
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:15,140
clothes for the winter

463
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,140
time I just kind

464
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:17,660
of lived in like my

465
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:17,660
big sweaters and

466
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:20,240
t-shirts and leggings

467
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:20,240
there was going on

468
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:23,120
vacation and March to

469
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:23,120
the Caribbean so I

470
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,370
kind of needed some

471
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,370
comfy stretchy

472
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,010
outfits that I could

473
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,010
wear during my

474
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:29,899
pregnancy as well as

475
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,899
after my pregnancy

476
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:31,730
so I didn't buy any

477
00:09:29,889 --> 00:09:31,730
like maternity

478
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:34,760
clothes I literally

479
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,760
went to brandy

480
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:37,130
Melville and she and

481
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,130
in fashion Nova and

482
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:39,230
I bought a bunch of

483
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,230
dresses so ending in

484
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:40,970
March which I would

485
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,970
have been like four

486
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:43,670
months pregnant at

487
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,670
that point I needed

488
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:45,770
to buy new clothes

489
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,770
because my denim

490
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:48,200
shorts and everything

491
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,200
that was just not

492
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:50,089
gonna cut it it was

493
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,089
too tight on me too

494
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,450
high-waisted like it

495
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,450
was just not gonna

496
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,180
happen

497
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:55,400
I ordered some stuff from Target

498
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:57,250
actually on a pair of

499
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,250
maternity leggings

500
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:59,990
so that's actually

501
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,990
the very first

502
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:03,140
maternity anything

503
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:03,140
that I purchased and

504
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:04,970
then I bought some

505
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:04,970
t-shirts and so much

506
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:08,120
stretchy tank tops

507
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:08,120
that I can wear in

508
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:11,720
the summer and just

509
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:11,720
be cozy and comfy

510
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:13,100
because there's

511
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,100
nothing I want more

512
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,930
right now than to

513
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:14,930
just be comfortable

514
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:17,450
this question says

515
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,450
has anything about

516
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:19,550
pregnancy surprised you lots of

517
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,829
surprises lots and

518
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,829
lots of surprises

519
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:24,110
some this one I don't

520
00:10:21,819 --> 00:10:24,110
know if it's like

521
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:27,920
really a surprise or

522
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,920
just kind of like I

523
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:29,390
don't know but the

524
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,390
first one is now that

525
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,600
my boobs have grown

526
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,600
and my belly has

527
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:34,760
grown the bottom of

528
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,760
my boobs touches the

529
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,680
top of my stomach and

530
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,680
it's the weirdest

531
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:39,200
thing that has never

532
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,200
happened to me I've

533
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:41,570
always had mosquito

534
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:41,570
bites for boobs and

535
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,770
a flat stomach so

536
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,770
that's literally never

537
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:44,750
happened to me and now that it's

538
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:46,250
happening I don't

539
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,250
know how I feel about

540
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:49,220
it so like I'll

541
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,220
literally just be

542
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:51,829
sitting there in the

543
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:51,829
bathtub or no bra

544
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:53,390
and wearing my t-shirt

545
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:53,390
and I can feel

546
00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:56,300
the bottom of my boobs

547
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:56,300
touch the top of

548
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:58,160
my stomach and it

549
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:58,160
feels so funny like I

550
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:00,320
don't know if it

551
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,320
just doesn't I don't

552
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:03,650
know it just feels

553
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:03,650
really weird another

554
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,329
surprise is the round

555
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,329
ligament pain that

556
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:07,490
I've been getting

557
00:11:05,319 --> 00:11:07,490
so I do get round

558
00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:09,860
ligament pain in my

559
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,860
uterus and basically

560
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:11,540
what that is is your

561
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,540
uterus is expanding

562
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,020
obviously to make

563
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,020
room for the growing

564
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:15,470
baby

565
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:17,449
so that hurts you

566
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,449
know and it kind of

567
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:19,040
feels like menstrual

568
00:11:17,439 --> 00:11:19,040
cramps more just

569
00:11:17,449 --> 00:11:20,990
like a dull pain and

570
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,990
it's just kind of

571
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,959
there and there's

572
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,959
not really much you

573
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:26,360
can do about it

574
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:26,360
the next thing is

575
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:28,520
pregnancy brain

576
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:28,520
pregnancy brain is the

577
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:33,650
realest thing I have

578
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:33,650
ever experienced in

579
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:35,990
my life I cannot express

580
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,990
how dumb I have

581
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:38,779
been feeling the past

582
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,779
few months at work

583
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:40,250
I've made so many

584
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:40,250
mistakes so I just

585
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:42,260
write everything

586
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,260
down that I possibly

587
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:44,930
can before I forget

588
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,930
it pregnancy brain

589
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:47,089
is crazy and usually

590
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,089
I'm not like on top

591
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:49,240
of things I have a

592
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:49,240
really good memory

593
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:50,990
I'm usually really

594
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,990
on top of things but

595
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,310
lately I just

596
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:54,490
I don't know where I'm

597
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,490
at my head's like

598
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:57,079
in the clouds it seems

599
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,079
the last surprise

600
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:59,540
basically is just

601
00:11:57,069 --> 00:11:59,540
pregnancy overall like

602
00:11:57,079 --> 00:12:00,820
I've never been

603
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:00,820
pregnant before so this

604
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:03,230
is like the realest

605
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:05,930
newest thing my body has ever

606
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:08,360
experienced like

607
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,360
everything every single

608
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:09,770
day there's something

609
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,770
new so I think

610
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,050
that's like a big

611
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,050
shock it's like

612
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:14,660
there's like always

613
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,660
something new going

614
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:18,250
on in my body and the

615
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:18,250
fact that there's

616
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:21,770
an actual human being

617
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,770
growing inside of

618
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:24,110
my uterus right now

619
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,110
is absolutely insane

620
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:25,730
and incredible at the

621
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,730
same time I got a

622
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,860
couple questions about

623
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,860
my daily routine

624
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:29,870
so like what changes

625
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,870
have you made in

626
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:32,540
your daily routine

627
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,540
what's the same in

628
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:34,279
your daily routine

629
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:34,279
self-care I think is

630
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:36,410
my biggest change

631
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:36,410
like I've been caring

632
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:38,449
for myself a lot

633
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,449
better now and kind of

634
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:40,430
like pampering myself

635
00:12:38,439 --> 00:12:40,430
a little more I do

636
00:12:38,449 --> 00:12:42,500
a lot more like face

637
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,500
masks and bubble

638
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:44,779
baths because that

639
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:44,779
just kind of helps me

640
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:47,180
soothe and relax

641
00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:47,180
throughout the day just

642
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:47,710
because I do get

643
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:47,710
really really really

644
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,900
tight

645
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:52,390
really easily

646
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:52,390
especially after a long

647
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:54,070
day at work and then

648
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,070
I come home and I

649
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:56,230
take a bubble bath

650
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,230
and I do a face mask

651
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:58,300
and I just feel great

652
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,300
like it just kind

653
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:01,390
of energizes me a

654
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:01,390
little bit gives me in

655
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:03,070
a state of relaxation

656
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,070
and then I sleep

657
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:05,560
really well as well

658
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,560
because of that

659
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:06,490
another thing that

660
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,490
has changed is I do

661
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,740
take vitamins

662
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:10,750
so before like I tried

663
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:10,750
taking vitamins

664
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:13,390
but it wasn't

665
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,390
consistent it was more

666
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:15,700
like once every few

667
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,700
days but I do take

668
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:17,770
prenatal vitamins and

669
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,770
vitamin D vitamins

670
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:21,010
because there is no

671
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,010
Sun here in Chicago

672
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:25,150
my vitamin D levels

673
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,150
are really really

674
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:27,670
low so vitamin D

675
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,670
really important and

676
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:29,620
then my prenatal

677
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,620
is very extremely

678
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:32,590
important and I make

679
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:32,590
sure they have DHA

680
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:34,390
and m2 it helps the

681
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,390
baby so basically

682
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:35,950
overall a more

683
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,950
conscious of my health

684
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:40,090
like I've always had

685
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:40,090
problems with low

686
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:42,670
blood sugar and low

687
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,670
iron and just all

688
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:45,250
sorts of things that

689
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,250
make me feel really

690
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:47,470
weak so I've been

691
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,470
more conscious of my

692
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:49,030
health I eat a lot

693
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,030
better than I used to

694
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:51,640
even though before

695
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,640
it did eat pretty

696
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:53,560
well I wasn't eating

697
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,560
as consistent as I

698
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,540
should basically so

699
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,540
I've been eating

700
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:57,100
every two hours almost

701
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,810
I just been making

702
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:58,810
better choices with

703
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:01,270
what I have been

704
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,270
eating and I've been

705
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:03,280
drinking a lot a lot

706
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,280
more water than I

707
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:05,680
used to mainly because

708
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:05,680
I'm a lot more

709
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:07,660
thirsty but I've

710
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,660
been drinking a lot

711
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,310
more water next

712
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,310
question says what are

713
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:12,040
your thoughts on

714
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,040
using the epidural

715
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:14,830
during labor for me

716
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:14,830
I think I might get

717
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,720
the epidural because

718
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,720
I don't like pain

719
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:19,300
and if there's something

720
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:19,300
out there that

721
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,280
can help me not feel

722
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,280
the pain then I'm

723
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:23,980
all about it but at

724
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,980
the same time I'm

725
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:26,830
not sure how everything

726
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,830
is gonna go like

727
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:29,980
if I feel like I don't

728
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,980
need the epidural

729
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:32,740
then I'm not gonna

730
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:32,740
get it but if I feel

731
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:34,120
like I need it I'm

732
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:34,120
going to get it and I

733
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:37,600
do want to try and natural birth

734
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:39,730
sometime I'm just not

735
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,730
sure how I'm gonna

736
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,770
take it but that's

737
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,770
what our bodies are

738
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:45,160
meant to do we're

739
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,160
stronger than we think

740
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:46,540
and I think I'll

741
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,540
do a natural birth

742
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,270
eventually but I

743
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:49,270
think for this first

744
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:51,760
time I'm going to

745
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,760
get that maduro see

746
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:54,070
how it goes and then

747
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,070
if I don't like it

748
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,740
then next time I have

749
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:58,990
you get this other

750
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,990
question that I have

751
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:01,660
says what scares you

752
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,660
most about labor

753
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:05,399
I'm not really afraid

754
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:05,399
to push I'm more

755
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:07,870
afraid of like pooping

756
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:07,870
while pushing so

757
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:10,120
obviously like it

758
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,120
happens to almost

759
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:12,970
every woman who does

760
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,970
push our babies out

761
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:14,980
but I just I really

762
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,980
I'm gonna be scarred

763
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:18,250
for life man I think

764
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:18,250
I'm more afraid of

765
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:20,230
recovery rather than

766
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,230
actual labor itself

767
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:22,209
I'm afraid of tearing

768
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,209
and then needing

769
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:23,620
stitches or like how

770
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:23,620
bad that tear is

771
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:25,060
gonna be that's what

772
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:25,060
I'm really afraid

773
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:27,759
of it's like tearing

774
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,759
and then having

775
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:28,240
that burning when you

776
00:15:27,749 --> 00:15:28,240
pee and just not

777
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:30,639
about that

778
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,529
yeah I'm not really

779
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:32,529
afraid like the

780
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,120
contractions like

781
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:34,120
yeah I'm afraid of

782
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:36,220
that but I don't know we'll see

783
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,069
obviously I've never

784
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,069
done this before I

785
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:40,930
don't know what I'm

786
00:15:38,059 --> 00:15:40,930
talking about so

787
00:15:38,069 --> 00:15:42,880
that's that the next

788
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,880
question says did

789
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:45,399
you consider waiting

790
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,399
to find out your

791
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,680
baby's sex or were

792
00:15:45,389 --> 00:15:47,680
you like I need to

793
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:50,529
know I needed to know

794
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:50,529

00:15:57,449 --> 00:15:59,079
