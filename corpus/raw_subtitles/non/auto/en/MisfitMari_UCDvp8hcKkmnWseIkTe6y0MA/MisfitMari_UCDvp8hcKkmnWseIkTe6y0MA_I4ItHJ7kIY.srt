90
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,560
from indiana they're

91
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:48,560
like indiana

92
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,840
where is that what do

93
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,840

94
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,560
i'm just like you know

95
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,000
we got cornfields and

96
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,000

97
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,079
and they're like wow

98
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:56,079
i didn't even know

99
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,680
black people existed

100
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:59,680
in indiana i'm like

101
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:03,040
yeah we barely exist here

102
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:06,479
what is your sign

103
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,479
i am technically

104
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,560
a virgo but i

105
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:08,560
believe in the cups

106
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,039
signs so a cup sign

107
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,039
is like when you're

108
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,239
born at the end or at

109
00:02:11,029 --> 00:02:12,239
the very beginning

110
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,959
of each sign

111
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,160
cycle so i was born

112
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:16,160
on the 21st of

113
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,200
september so that's like

114
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,920
basically the end

115
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,920
of virgo season and

116
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,319
almost the beginning

117
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,319
of libra so i you

118
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,640
know i feel like i

119
00:02:24,309 --> 00:02:26,640
represent both signs

120
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,239
technically i'm a

121
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,239
virgo but i believe

122
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,440
that i'm a virgo libra cuss

123
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,480
my moon sign is aries

124
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,480
and my rising sign

125
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,760
is sagittarius

126
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:38,959
are you an extrovert

127
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,959
or an introvert so

128
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,120
i am an introvert i'm a very

129
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,080
introverted person

130
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,080
i've been like this

131
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,239
since

132
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,440
before i can even

133
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:45,440
remember i've always

134
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,080
been an introvert

135
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,920
when people talk to

136
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,920
me i'm super shy

137
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,920
even when i get to

138
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,920
know someone like i'm

139
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,040
more of a listener

140
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,040
than a talker which

141
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,680
is funny because

142
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,680
i have a youtube

143
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,120
channel but

144
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,959
when people meet me

145
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,959
in person they're

146
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,840

i'll put a list of

234
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,320
like the smaller

235
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,320

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,120
what is your most

240
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,759
i don't even know why

241
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,759
i put this on here

242
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
one of my most

243
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:10,000
embarrassing moments was

244
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,639
when

245
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,039
i was in middle school

246
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:13,039
so i was on the

247
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,360
bus

248
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,039
and i had like my

249
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,039
backpack and i i

250
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,479
forget like what i was

251
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:18,479
doing my backpack

252
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,160
i think i had to

253
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:20,160
like check something

254
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:23,360
like check homework or something

255
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,600
so i didn't close my

256
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,600
backpack like all

257
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,639
the way i thought i

258
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:28,639
did but i didn't

259
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,360
so as i was like

260
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:31,360
getting off the bus

261
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,440
like my backpack

262
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,440
flew open and all my

263
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,000
papers and stuff like

264
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,600
were everywhere and

265
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,600
this was like right

266
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,440
in front of the middle school

267
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,520
at my middle school

268
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,520
like all the like

269
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,919
the cool kids and

270
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:41,919
stuff would like hang

271
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,000
out

272
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,000
in front of the

273
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,000
school before school

274
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,720
starts

275
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,160
so you can only imagine

276
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,160
a middle school

277
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,360
me

278
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:57,600
with my glasses and

279
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:57,600
my little ponytail

280
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,919
in the bang like all

281
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,919
my papers like flew

282
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,280
everywhere i was like i was so

283
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,639
embarrassed but

284
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,639
people were really

285
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,319
really nice they were like

286
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,000
and they helped me

287
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:06,000
get up all my papers

288
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,319
because it was a lot of papers

289
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,600
so like literally like

290
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:09,600
i think like five

291
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,199
people helped me get up

292
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,360
get my papers up but it was so

293
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,520
embarrassing it was

294
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:15,520
so embarrassing

295
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,120
what do you want to

296
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,120
do with your life

297
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,160
isn't that the big

298
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,160
question like what do

299
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,720
you want to do with your life

300
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,840
i think overall like

301
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:21,840
if i could live the

302
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,800
life that i want to live

303
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,120
i would probably travel

304
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:25,120
like 24 7 like i

305
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,639
love

306
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,680
traveling so much

307
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:31,680
like it's crazy

308
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:34,880
so i would travel all

309
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:34,880
the freaking time

310
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,240
and i would get paid for it

311
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,000
a lot of people want

312
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,000
to get settled down

313
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,360
get married have

314
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,360
kids but that's not

315
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,400
really my goal my goal

316
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,560
is to travel like

317
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,560
if i could travel

318
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,240
forever for the rest

319
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,240
of my life that

320
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,479
would be the best thing

321
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,599
to me what's the

322
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:49,599
next place on your

323
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,919
travel list

324
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,440
so i really want

325
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:53,440
to visit an asian

326
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,919
country i want to go to

327
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,240
japan like japan has

328
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:58,240
been on my wish

329
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,000
list ever since i was

330
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:00,000
in middle school

331
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,000
so i really want

332
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,000
to go to an asian

333
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,680
country next like

334
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,680
i've been to european

335
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,080
countries within south

336
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:06,080
african countries

337
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,400
south american countries

338
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:08,400
i really really

339
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:12,000
want to go to an asian country

340
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:15,199
so so badly what is

341
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:15,199
your biggest fear

342
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,759
so my biggest fear

343
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:15,759
is probably like my

344
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,120
biggest fear

345
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,479
isn't death i know a

346
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,479
lot of people say

347
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,520
their biggest fear

348
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:19,520
is like it's death

349
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,360
dying

350
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,880
um but i'm not

351
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,880
scared of death just

352
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,960
because i know it's gonna come

353
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,440
no matter what so

354
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,440
you can't really do

355
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,840
anything about death

356
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,840
so i think it's

357
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,880
dying without living

358
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:30,880
the life that i

359
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,720
want to live

360
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,800
or dying without

361
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,800
doing all the things

362
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,840
that i want to do

363
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:35,840
or dying without

364
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,160
living

365
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:42,240
to like my highest potential

366
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,000
if that makes sense

367
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,000
so there's a lot of

368
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,160
things that i want to

369
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:46,160
do i want to see i

370
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,759
want to experience so if i die

371
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,599
without doing those

372
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:49,599
things like that's

373
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,400
probably the biggest

374
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:50,400
one of the biggest

375
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:54,400
fear

376
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:57,360
that i have what are

377
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,360
your pet peeves

378
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,240
so i would say the

379
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,240
biggest pet peeve of

380
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,280
mine are

381
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,680
like people who are

382
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,680
constantly negative

383
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,360
i understand that

384
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,360
you know life isn't

385
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,560
all rainbows and

386
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,080
unicorn sunshine

387
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,080
poop and throw up

388
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,639
whenever i speak to

389
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,639
someone and they

390
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,639
always have something

391
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:14,639
negative to say

392
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,479
then that like is a

393
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:16,479

00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,120
of sucks sometimes

399
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,400
but life is also really

400
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,400
beautiful people

401
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,879
who are very rude

402
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,800
i don't like that like

403
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:26,800
that is a big pet

404
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,120
peeve of mine like

405
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:29,120
why like why are you

406
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,000
being so rude to this

407
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,000
person or why are

408
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,800
you like

409
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,240
like so angry all the

410
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,240
time when do you

411
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,519
want to have kids and

412
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,519
how many kids do

413
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,360
you want

414
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:43,039
um i don't

415
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:46,800
so i don't think i

416
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:46,800
want to have any kids

417
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:49,519
the thought of having kids just

418
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,920
kind of freaks me out

419
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:51,920
i think that if i

420
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,959
do have kids it won't

421
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,959
be until i'm like

422
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,000
45 or 50 and then

423
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:56,000
like i'll probably

424
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,240
adopt

425
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,279
and the kids that i

426
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,279
adopt will probably

427
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,040
be teenagers

428
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,279
the thought of like

429
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:03,279
taking care of a

430
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,320
baby

431
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:09,040
all the time it doesn't

432
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,399
it doesn't sit well

433
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,399
with my spirit so if

434
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,640
anybody wants my eggs

435
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,399
like you can have

436
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,399
them they're up for

437
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,680
sale what do you look for in a

438
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:19,120
relationship

439
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,600
so this is a good

440
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,600
question um usually

441
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,040
i'm like i'm a serial

442
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,040
dater so i usually

443
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,640
date like a lot of people

444
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,800
but i don't really get into

445
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,279
relationships often at all

446
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,360
because i believe

447
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:31,360
that dating is for

448
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,480
dating and it's to

449
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,480
get to know a person

450
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,279
and then when you're

451
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,480
in a relationship

452
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:36,480
that means that you

453
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:40,000
look at this person

454
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,760
as a viable partner

455
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,760
so for me i only get

456
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,320
into a relationship

457
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,320
when i see the other

458
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,560
person

459
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,240
as like a potential

460
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,240

461
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,320
biggest things that

462
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,320
i look for like

463
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,519
in a partner is

464
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:49,519
like being someone

465
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,480
