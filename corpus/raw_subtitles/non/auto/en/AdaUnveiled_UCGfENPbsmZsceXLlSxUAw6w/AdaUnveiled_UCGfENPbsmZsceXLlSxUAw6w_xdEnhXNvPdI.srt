00:00:43,949 --> 00:00:49,589
into a video called the Latino tag and I

7
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:51,960
don't know what better target to first

8
00:00:49,589 --> 00:00:55,710
start off I am a super proud to be

9
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,689
latina and I feel like a lot of people

10
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,799
really look into these videos cuz you

11
00:00:57,689 --> 00:01:02,939
know it's something that we can all

12
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:06,179
relate to you know old fan so I got my

13
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:09,479
questions from Monica style Muse she has

14
00:01:06,179 --> 00:01:11,850
Dominican like me better I don't want to

15
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:14,009
eat that you're silly being blanquita

16
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,409
and I thought I would be awesome you

17
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:18,929
know because she's after latina and I'm

18
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:21,509
like super pale so I think it's really

19
00:01:18,929 --> 00:01:24,929
nice you know to show the two sides of

20
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:28,229
our islands so this is the first this is

21
00:01:24,929 --> 00:01:31,890
the first question where are you from so

22
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:34,799
your girl is American I was born in New

23
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:37,319
York City but literally like two months

24
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,229
after I was born I moved to Dominican

25
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:43,259
Republic and some time ago I was raised

26
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:45,030
there for like I want to say eight nine

27
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,280
years and then I moved back to the

28
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,289
States

29
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:51,269
usually you're born in like rabbuka

30
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:53,280
americana and they here like move to New

31
00:01:51,269 --> 00:01:55,019
York again your papers or whatever so

32
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,300
usually that's how it happens but I

33
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:59,399
think this whole opposite just which is

34
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,330
really nice my childhood was so poppin

35
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,909
it's so different

36
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:04,560
going up on an island compared to going

37
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:05,729
up here in the States when you're a

38
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,140
little that's for sure

39
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:12,060
do you speak Spanish do I speak Spanish

40
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,680
Claud okay y'all espanol

41
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,769
it's my hair let me be mini yo ma

42
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,459
Spanish is my first language and even

43
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:23,040
now I mess up my words sometimes I think

44
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:24,959
in Spanish but my English just sometimes

45
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,349
messes up you know it's bilingual

46
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:31,650
problems what what's your favorites are

47
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:35,489
making this literally like this is so

48
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:38,569
hard I can't even I love food and my

49
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:43,060
favorite Dominican dish I want to say

50
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:47,620
it's like a mango mango is the bad

51
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:51,970
I love is plantain smashed

52
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:58,120
right and then you can have Wilfredo

53
00:02:51,970 --> 00:03:00,340
fried fried eggs or you can have Scilab

54
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,959
you frito and then if you want to hear

55
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:06,250
with the three bangs I think it's like

56
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:11,080
salami Weibull and fried cheese oh my

57
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:12,700
gosh so much I can eat that in the

58
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,010
morning in the afternoon I can hear it

59
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:17,470
at night I can eat it literally whatever

60
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:20,769
and I'll be happy it's so good oh my

61
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:22,590
gosh what's the next question is what's

62
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:28,600
your favorite is I'm gonna get dessert

63
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:31,870
yo the Dominican dessert I love arroz

64
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,280
con leche I think that's like Hispanic

65
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:35,620
though cuz you see them like in a Cubano

66
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,019
the Puerto Ricans have it like in the

67
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:40,209
restaurant but I don't know when I was

68
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:41,800
that's I don't know made it because the

69
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:45,880
Caribbean is all like one big thing to

70
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:49,870
me and I love I wish what I would say

71
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,440
why I mean I don't say y'all I shouldn't

72
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:55,030
it

73
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:56,560
I love each other compensate yes so your

74
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,730
parents our grandparents have plastic

75
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,340
over there so fast

76
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:02,320
no they don't but that's a thing that's

77
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,570
a thing for sure but no my godmother

78
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,640
doesn't have but she does have instead

79
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:09,640
of plastic she's like okay did she now

80
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,260
has a folder like it blends in with the

81
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:15,489
sofa so it looks like it's part of the

82
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:18,130
sofa what item in your household

83
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:19,780
explains where you're from oh my gosh so

84
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:23,310
this doesn't get any more intimate again

85
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:25,810
I'm gonna put a clip in I have here a

86
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:28,419
casitas colonial like these are little

87
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:30,940
houses and you buy them in the island or

88
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:32,919
whatever and they're handmade and as you

89
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,870
guys I don't know if you guys knew but

90
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:36,700
Dominican Republic is the oldest country

91
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:39,160
in the West hemisphere it's actually the

92
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:42,160
first island that Christopher Columbus

93
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,539
discovered and that's what he discovered

94
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,430
the worst atmosphere

95
00:04:43,539 --> 00:04:47,530
which is crazy because we have his

96
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:50,350
castle and all that stuff and it's a

97
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:51,610
little mean boat and it's pretty funny I

98
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,440
don't know I I don't think a lot of

99
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:55,600
people know that but

100
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:57,820
you're welcome so since you know their

101
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,520
colonial houses this just represents

102
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:03,460
well from basically like la zona

103
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:06,610
colonial is the caches the color yarn is

104
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:07,210
a colonial houses who is your favorite

105
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:11,050
melon ghetto

106
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:13,840
so this is the problem this is where it

107
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:15,760
gets crazy for me I don't really listen

108
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,980
to anything like that

109
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,050
oh okay so if I would say actually

110
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:22,120
before I even look at food I need dough

111
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:25,240
and that's like pretty good API and not

112
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:27,340
even merengue love hula neato Pula neato

113
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,690
oh my god everything bad 90s memories

114
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,640
because I grew up in the 90s on the

115
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:32,950
island so literally all the parties

116
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:35,470
everywhere you went the stream move

117
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:38,670
might not have a soul bobbing way where

118
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:38,670
would I need oh I'm sure
