14
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:53,010
know working for a college that requires

15
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:56,039
me to basically I would say use social

16
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:58,770
media as a tool and by the time I get

17
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,809
off home I better time I get off I don't

18
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,860

00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:06,510
on my youtube nothing I don't want to I

20
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:07,710
don't know I've just had a little bit I

21
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,229
just had a little bit of issues with

22
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:12,180
like balancing things that's why I've

23
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:14,100
been just off my Facebook and everything

24
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,979
was just like my Instagram I you two

25
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,360
just like prioritizing working and then

26
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:21,240
getting off we get spending time with my

27
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,869
family my husband my kid and you know

28
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,850
now I feel like I'm having a little bit

29
00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:28,770
now I'm just in this level of I'm gonna

30
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,930
get back to my stuff because I do miss

31
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,759
being creative with you guys I've missed

32
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,220
editing videos I missed recording I miss

33
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,560
having a voice a little bit I'm not

34
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,630
gonna lie it kind of sucks in a way that

35
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:43,020
I've noticed that I've just not recorded

36
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:46,680
anything what's going on this is like my

37
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:50,100
outlet also a big deal is is that I've

38
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:53,130
been diagnosed with ADHD and I'm so

39
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:56,009
happy that I finally got diagnosed

40
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,990
because with those months that I took my

41
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:00,000
social media break from my social media

42
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:03,000
is because I just could not handle all

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,149
the things that I'm trying to do like I

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,569
do YouTube videos I have an online shop

45
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:13,800
as you guys know ADA unveiled and I also

46
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:15,720
have I also work full time I'm a mommy

47
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,870
the Navy's always gonna have to take

48
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:21,750
care of my son and I didn't know what it

49
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:23,340
was that I was you know all my life I've

50
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,040
been asked like do you have ADHD because

51
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:29,100
I do struggle in focusing I struggle and

52
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,770
some other obvious like signs I do

53
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:34,080
struggle with so there is a thing such

54
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:36,270
as like adult ADHD and I wanted to get

55
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,280
checked because I've been asked this all

56
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:40,020
my life like my friend's parents would

57
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,820
be like hey do you have any AGG and I

58
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,710
would totally be in denial like no I

59
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,450
would ask my mom and my mom would tell

60
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:49,230
me I don't have anything obviously she's

61
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:50,490
my mom you know so now that I am 25 26 I

62
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:52,320
felt the need that you know I'm gonna

63
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:55,560
get checked just in case I spoke to a

64
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:58,320
doctor and um he agreed he agreed that I

65
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,630
definitely have some some signs there

66
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:03,270
that I have ADHD so when you have video

67
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:06,150
to do you can't focus and I have so much

68
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,920
to do in my life that it was just eating

69
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:10,110
me up like laundry wouldn't be done in a

70
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,030
minute um in the sense of like I

71
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:15,210
wouldn't wash it but I would never I

72
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:16,890
would never fold a cuz I couldn't I

73
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:19,380
couldn't I just couldn't stand still to

74
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:20,970
fold it I had to move around often I

75
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,980
started like little mini projects that I

76
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:25,080
never ends I would get simple things

77
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:27,989
like my keys I would forget my wallet

78
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,450
just I would just be everywhere and

79
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:32,550
being an entrepreneur working full time

80
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:35,750
and also trying to be a present mom and

81
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:38,160
wife is just so much but I feel like

82
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,870
there's a way that I can do this that I

83
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,950
can go ahead and still pursue my

84
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:45,750
creativity supposedly ADHD people have

85
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:48,390
are really good with being creative and

86
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,739
I definitely see that as y'all know I am

87
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:53,250
creative I love it

88
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:55,050
I've been really just frustrated when it

89
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,610
comes to time management I'm not good at

90
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:59,610
it and I'm trying to get my life

91
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:01,350
together with that but since I did say

92
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:02,910
that I do start mini projects and I

93
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:04,709
never end them I do have some videos

94
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,660
that are pre-recorded so I'm gonna go

95
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:09,000
ahead and upload those but it's just

96
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:11,190
like I never end them I never I record

97
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,930
them but I don't edit knowing that I

98
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:15,060
have to have a youtube video up or

99
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:17,609
whatever the case is I choose not to and

100
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:20,280
that's like something that ADHD people

101
00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:23,190
have that they just procrastinate and

102
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:26,010
that's like my issue as well so I am not

103
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:27,240
taking any medications at all because I

104
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:29,340
have any HD I'm trying

105
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,229
to see if I can just time manage better

106
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,099
I spoke to a doctor the doctor told me

107
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,240
since you don't want to take medication

108
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:35,460
like at all

109
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,500
etc try these methods and he gave me a

110
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,240
few I want to say like right now what's

111
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:43,410
working for me is the hourly hourly

112
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:45,479
agenda that I have but um I feel like I

113
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:48,509
have to master this down as a person in

114
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:51,030
general like to feel sane I'm so glad

115
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:54,120
that I literally do not feel crazy for

116
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:55,050
wandering about have ADHD and I'm glad

117
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,900
that I got checked

118
00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:00,720
I feel like Latinos and you know we're

119
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:02,970
just really hard on mental health like

120
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,220
this is something that we don't look

121
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:07,169
into enough and maybe not even as a

122
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,300
Latino as people in general we like we

123
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:11,430
don't we don't go and get ourselves

124
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,080
checked for mental health and I feel

125
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:16,530
like if you feel you might have an issue

126
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:19,530
like focusing or depression or I don't

127
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:22,740
