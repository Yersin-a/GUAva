someone asked me I'm

25
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,780
like this is what

26
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:45,660
I'm going to say anyway

27
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,660
so I was born in

28
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:48,719
Champaign Urbana

29
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:48,719
Illinois but yeah so I

30
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:51,539
live there born there

31
00:00:48,709 --> 00:00:51,539
and lived it for

32
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,750
nine years then I

33
00:00:51,529 --> 00:00:54,750
moved to Phoenix

34
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:57,239
Arizona from Oh

35
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,239
Niles 9 to 11 and I

36
00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:00,300
lived there for a

37
00:00:57,229 --> 00:01:00,300
little bit it was so

38
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:01,859
hot like I can't I

39
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:01,859
can't imagine living

40
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,589
somewhere that's over

41
00:01:01,849 --> 00:01:04,589
a hundred degrees

42
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:07,799
on a regular basis I

43
00:01:04,579 --> 00:01:07,799
can't I don't even

44
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:09,960
go outside here if

45
00:01:07,789 --> 00:01:09,960
it's above like 85

46
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:14,450
so that was a little

47
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:14,450
stint in the hot

48
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:16,830
desert but for

49
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,830
majority of my like

50
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:19,409
adolescent teen young

51
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,409
adult life I've

52
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:24,150
been living in

53
00:01:19,399 --> 00:01:24,150
Seattle Washington

54
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:28,170
well technically

55
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:28,170
Tacoma but Seattle for

56
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:31,259
college so long story

57
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,259
short born and

58
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:34,409

00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:38,009
Seattle Washington

61
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:38,009
so there's my story

62
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:42,360
with that next question

63
00:01:37,999 --> 00:01:42,360

99
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:27,930

100
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,930
coincide with the

101
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,300

diva deja and I just

105
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:38,910
changed the youth

00:02:33,229 --> 00:02:38,910
user name to fit my

107
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:40,500
news theme so yeah

108
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,500

109
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:43,319

00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:48,360
be like hair videos

115
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:50,940
in 2016 and when I

116
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,940
studied abroad I was

117
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,260
uploading some

118
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,260

and day by day so

133
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,600
what that means basically

134
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,600
