00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,180
also got the island

50
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:06,270

00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,270
this is from natural

52
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,189
aunty essentials I

53
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,189
was really like due

54
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,350
for some shea butter

55
00:01:08,179 --> 00:01:10,350
for my body because

56
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:12,869
that's the only

57
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,869
moisturizer that I use

58
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:14,310
is really shea butter

59
00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:14,310
or almond oil or

60
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:15,810
vitamin E oil butter

61
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,810

62
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,840

63
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,840
not this was it

64
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:21,420
really shea butter is

65
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,420
only butter I used

66
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,640
and so my review of

67
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,640
this I love this

68
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,979
when I when I start

69
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,979
to run out of shea

70
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,420
butter I start just

71
00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:27,420
using coconut oil on

72
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:29,159
my whole body and

73
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,159
then shave it on my

74
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,689
face to present for

75
00:01:29,149 --> 00:01:30,689
the jar because shea

76
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,670
butter can get so

77
00:01:30,679 --> 00:01:32,670
expensive here in the

78
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:35,880
States and so I was

79
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,880
excited to try this

80
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:38,460
out it feels like

81
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:38,460
my body looks like

82
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,000
enveloped in a cream

83
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:39,000
so I really love

84
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,049
this

85
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,649

00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:46,649

conditioning hair mask

96
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:59,820
it's to promote thicker

00:01:57,649 --> 00:01:59,820

98
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:03,240

00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:19,370
ingredients water cetera alcohol

00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:23,299

lavender oil at the

116
00:02:27,399 --> 00:02:29,269
bottom it has some

117
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:31,760
like a sensuous

118
00:02:29,259 --> 00:02:31,760
it's interesting it

119
00:02:29,269 --> 00:02:33,829
smells kind of lemony

120
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,829
but live doesn't

121
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,430
really smell like that

122
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:37,430
much was I just a

123
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:40,459
lemon type of really

124
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,459
my wash day is has

125
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:42,799
been going really I

126
00:02:40,449 --> 00:02:42,799
know a lot faster

127
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:45,680
because my hair has

128
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:45,680
been super stretched

129
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:48,379
and detangling that's

130
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:48,379
one thing I've

131
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,329
added to my routine

132
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:50,329
is like detangling

133
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:51,919
and I had my hair

134
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,919
and twist the whole

135
00:02:50,329 --> 00:02:54,799
week so my hair was like pretty

136
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:56,900
stretched and didn't

137
00:02:54,789 --> 00:02:56,900
have too many you

138
00:02:54,799 --> 00:03:02,599
know things to comb

139
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:02,599
out the first couple

140
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:04,700
of strokes with this

141
00:03:02,589 --> 00:03:04,700
it is it's a really

142
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:07,459
really thick mask

143
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,459
I like the way it

144
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:09,799
feels as far as the

145
00:03:07,449 --> 00:03:09,799
consistency of the

146
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:13,159
product because it

147
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:13,159
is SuperDuper thick

148
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:16,729
it is so thick and

149
00:03:13,149 --> 00:03:16,729
that's what I need

150
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:20,379
for 4c hair so I

151
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:20,379
tend to really enjoy

152
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:22,579
the thicker thick thick

153
00:03:20,369 --> 00:03:22,579
thick product so

154
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:24,079
that's something I'm

155
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:24,079
liking so far with

156
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:28,519
how it feels on my

157
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:28,519
hair it's definitely

158
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:32,510
thick so if you have

159
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:32,510
like very fine hair

160
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:36,680
then probably wouldn't

161
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,680
select a product

162
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:40,849
like this but if

163
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:40,849
you have like more

164
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:44,900
porous hair or dry

165
00:03:40,839 --> 00:03:44,900
and coarse hair this

166
00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:48,159
might be something

167
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:48,159
for you 4c hair with

168
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:51,799
some for be around my

169
00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:51,799
edges I guess like

170
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,569
to show like 4b what

171
00:03:51,789 --> 00:03:53,569
I think is 4b for

172
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:56,780
me is like these

173
00:03:53,559 --> 00:03:56,780
little pieces that are

174
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:58,939
more defined spirals

175
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,939
and then other ones

176
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:03,199
I like maybe let's

177
00:03:58,929 --> 00:04:03,199
defined you're gonna

178
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:05,359
have to find 4c hair

179
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:05,359
but just like what

180
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:08,060
I see is just like

181
00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:08,060
the curl is like so

182
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:10,639
much more like a

183
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,639
spiral then my for see

184
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:13,909
once more zigzag but

185
00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:13,909
I have learned to

186
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:15,590
love them all when I

187
00:04:13,899 --> 00:04:15,590
first met now show

188
00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:17,450
I was like oh my

189
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,450
hair's gonna be so

190
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:18,570
curly like this I

191
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,570
think this little

192
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,890
piece got me so high

193
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:23,220
oh my god I'm have

194
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,220
like super loose

195
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:24,720
curls and be cute and

196
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:24,720
I really like one

197
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,920
in my hair like that

198
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:27,920
cuz I thought that

199
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,540
was like that's pretty

200
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,540
natural hair um

201
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:33,960
and so I feel like

202
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,960
it took me like a

203
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:36,960
year to like my actual

204
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,960
natural hair just

205
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:39,420
afro just an afro

206
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,420
not like having to

207
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,370
manipulate my curls

208
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,370
do it twist out all

209
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:43,950
the time to like

210
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,950
mimic the 4b that I

211
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:46,290
thought I had all the

212
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,290
time and I'm just

213
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:50,400
like well I like

214
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,400
it just like that

215
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:53,100
just a regular fro

216
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,100
just with out doing

217
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:57,030
anything to it you

218
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:57,030
know take some time

219
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:59,310
to love but now that

220
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,310
I I do love it you

221
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,960
can't tell me nothing

222
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,960
but that's really

223
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:03,780
the journal with a

224
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,780
journey with natural

225
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,520
hair and I just want

226
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,520
to share my piece

227
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,960
on it cuz that you

228
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,960
can transition to

229
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:12,750
eating you're like

230
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:12,750
oh yeah I love my

231
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:14,580
hair but then you're

232
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,580
like oh it's 4c and

233
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:18,380
I was like how old

234
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:18,380
was I like 19 when I

235
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:21,210
first hit that so I

236
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:21,210
still was just like

237
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:26,940
you know learning to

238
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,940
accept what my hair

239
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:31,620
looked like and growing

240
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:31,620
through that and

241
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:35,370
growing up and now

242
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:35,370
like yay my hair has

243
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:40,260
different textures

244
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,260
equally so here's my

245
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:42,900
shedding that's just

246
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,900
expect it I thought

247
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:48,410
were shedding honestly

248
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:48,410
but I'm not due

249
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:48,410
for another trim until

250
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:54,750
okay I'm definitely

251
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,750
feeling like a

252
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:56,700
tingling feeling

253
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,700
on my scalp and at

254
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,020
first I was worried

255
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,020
um and then I

256
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,820
realized and looked back on the

257
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:02,760
ingredients that

258
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:02,760
there's peppermint oil

259
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:04,800
inside of this cuz I

260
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,800
was like did I like

261
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:07,230
cuz I did put

262
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:07,230
essential oils on my

263
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,600
detangler but I rinse

264
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,600
my hair already

265
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:13,580
and watched it so I'm like there

266
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,990
shouldn't be any

267
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,990
feeling of this and

268
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:18,690
then I look on the

269
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,690
ingredients in there

270
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:20,430
is peppermint oil

271
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,430
even it even though

272
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:21,930
it's at the bottom

273
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,930
like the very end of

274
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:23,970
the ingredients

275
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,970
peppermint and essential

276
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:26,130
oil it seems to be

277
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,130
like strong enough to

278
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:28,169
where you'd fill it

279
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,169
you know if you add

280
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:30,560
a couple drops I

281
00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:30,560
definitely feel that on

282
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:30,560
my scalp

283
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:37,380
but I detangle it

284
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:37,380
like where I apply my

285
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,730
conditioner just like

286
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,730
any other like I

287
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:41,250
apply that condition

288
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,250
of the same every

289
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:43,530
time so if more you

290
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,530
watch my videos I'll

291
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:45,840
power PETA if you're

292
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,840
new but I start

293
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:48,060
from the ends I put

294
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,060
it so much on the

295
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,710
ends that's probably

296
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,710
why I keep on

297
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:55,260
buying so much product

298
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:55,260
cuz I use it so

299
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:59,460
quick and then I go

300
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:59,460
from up all the way

301
00:06:55,260 --> 00:07:05,430
up and like massage

302
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:05,430
it and then I do

303
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:09,770
Tanglewood make sure

304
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:09,770
it's thoroughly on

305
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:12,570
there so far I'm

306
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,570
really diggin the

307
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:15,710
thickness of it it's

308
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,710
hard to find like a

309
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:18,090
thick conditioner

310
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,090
cuz I feel like I

311
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:19,740
don't know I like the

312
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,740
kind - where were

313
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:21,030
you turn it over and

314
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,030
it just sticks like

315
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,560
I'm turning it over

316
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,560
and it's not going

317
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:25,260
nowhere that's the type of like

318
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,840
conditioner I need

319
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,840
that's what that but

320
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:29,990
mask and I need a

321
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,990
mask mask my hair you

322
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,990
know

323
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,000
you

324
00:07:54,180 --> 00:08:04,440
oh my god you guys

325
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:04,440
I'm almost done with

326
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:06,449
this jar oh my gosh

327
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,449
oh that's the thing

328
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,610
I'm so heavy-handed

329
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:08,610
I honestly thought

330
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:11,190
there was a like this

331
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,190
was a deeper jar

332
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:13,979
but I'm literally

333
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,979
already touching the

334
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:17,729
bottom I thought that

335
00:08:13,969 --> 00:08:17,729
I had at least a

336
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:21,530
couple more more

337
00:08:17,719 --> 00:08:21,530
inches into this jar

338
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:21,530
but oh man

339
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,130
you

340
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:51,470
okay so overall they

341
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,470
got through my hair

342
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:53,779
pretty easily smooth

343
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,779
and very thick so

344
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:55,339
let's see how afterwards

345
00:08:53,769 --> 00:08:55,339
I'll just like

346
00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:58,070
I found just feel

347
00:08:55,329 --> 00:08:58,070
my hair to see like

348
00:08:55,339 --> 00:09:00,020
okay was this a good

349
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,020
wash day or not did

350
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:02,450
this do what I say

351
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,450
is gonna do and

352
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:04,480
that's how I read

353
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,480
the product okay so

354
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:07,220
I'm gonna leave

355
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:07,220
this on my hair for

356
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,399
probably thirty

357
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:10,399
minutes of a little

358
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:12,940
slushed an hour um

359
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:12,940
that's a bad example

360
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:16,040
but really I need to

361
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:16,040
eat and wash power

362
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:18,110
during that time so

363
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:18,110
I'm gonna try to be

364
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,490
responsible and take

365
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,490
it off at a good

366
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:21,709
amount of time right

367
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,709
and just like that

368
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:24,649

369
00:09:21,699 --> 00:09:24,649
