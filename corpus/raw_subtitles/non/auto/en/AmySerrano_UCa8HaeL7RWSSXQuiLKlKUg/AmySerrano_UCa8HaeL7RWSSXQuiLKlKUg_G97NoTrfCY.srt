[Music]

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,939
Thank You Viviana for helping me name

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,590
this I posted this on Instagram and a

6
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:26,270
lot of you guys were asking to recreate

7
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:28,669
this look because I actually didn't film

8
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:31,279
the video when I did that look I went to

9
00:00:28,669 --> 00:00:32,570
this event for fresh which is super cool

10
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,269
because I was like all about astrology

11
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:37,400
it's for their zodiac soaps there was a

12
00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:40,070
lot of forecasting up in there like

13
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,720
what's coming in 2018 according to our

14
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:44,000
signs and everything like that so it was

15
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,830
pretty interesting but anyways you guys

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,340
wanted to see that look so I'm here

17
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:51,950
recreating that look the main like focus

18
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:53,960
or like what I was kind of basing every

19
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:56,570
all the colors around were actually this

20
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:59,120
natasha de Nona crystal topcoat this is

21
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:00,559
in the shade gray Brown and you guys

22
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,149
helped me choose this as well on

23
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,440
Instagram I had posted like which one

24
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:06,800
should I get and I actually ended up

25
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,600
getting peach and gray Brown but then my

26
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,220
friend finally wrote back to me saying

27
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,380
like don't get peach it's kind of like a

28
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:15,170
basic like you can get that in any kind

29
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:17,000
of palette and so I want to exchange it

30
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:20,060
and get the nude one because she says

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,140
the nude is beautiful so anyways let's

32
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,729
go ahead and get started this is gonna

33
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:25,700
be very chatty if you can't already tell

34
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:27,619
I'm feeling very chatty today I don't

35
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:31,009
know we'll just talk so let's go ahead

36
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:33,380
and start with my base actually you know

37
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:40,190
what I did this time around I used it as

38
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:42,950
a primer spray so now let's go right

39
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:44,690
into foundation I'm gonna use this one I

40
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:48,050
use the Double Wear foundation that

41
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:52,729
night as well because it gives a lot of

42
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:54,080
coverage at last all day all night so I

43
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:57,349
like this one for those kind of

44
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,700
occasions so I went ahead and used it it

45
00:01:57,349 --> 00:02:01,160
doesn't have a pump that's the only

46
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,840
bummer about it but it's a good

47
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:05,599
foundation it's so spreading that all

48
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,369
over I'm taking a bit more I just shake

49
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:11,599
it onto my finger until I get that and I

50
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:13,430
just like to do this I love to hear what

51
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,410
you guys want to see from me so

52
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:18,170
definitely keep sending in your requests

53
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:20,239
because I mean I always have tons of

54
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:22,310
ideas it's insane like how many ideas I

55
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,020
have like for fashion especially I'll

56
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:27,200
take care of those videos but you guys

57
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:29,950
definitely send me makeup stuff because

58
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,980
I tend to do like I'm like a one-hit

59
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:36,680
situation with like my natural looks so

60
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:40,310
there's any like celebrity you want me

61
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:42,739
to do or anything by any inspiration

62
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:43,970
that you guys see send it my way or even

63
00:02:42,739 --> 00:02:45,440
like a palette and I really create

64
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:49,040
something with this I'll definitely do

65
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:55,519
it I'm sorry I am just like so tired

66
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:59,330
today so I need my coffee and then I'm

67
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:03,620
just gonna apply my concealer this is

68
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:06,319
the glossier concealer when I go to

69
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:09,140
events I always use like my trusty faves

70
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:12,049
because it's like not really the time to

71
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:14,780
like test out stuff you know what I mean

72
00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:17,540
you don't want to like have your I don't

73
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:20,620
know concealer be all crusty I like to

74
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:24,470
use things that I love and trust

75
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:26,000
when I go out occasionally I'll play

76
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:28,760
around with like obviously eyeshadows

77
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,549
and I'm like whatever about that but the

78
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,829
complexion products have to be things

79
00:03:31,549 --> 00:03:39,670
I'm familiar with just your spot conceal

80
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:39,670
I'm gonna use this fit me by Maybelline

81
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:45,540
rather spot conceal then put on more

82
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:48,120
foundation the less makeup that I have

83
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:51,870
to wear the better I get really really

84
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,489
Creasy here here like my face just looks

85
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,830
a mess honestly when I wear a lot of

86
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:58,620
makeup I load my makeup done before for

87
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:00,360
like past events and stuff like either

88
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,790
at the MAC counter or whatever just like

89
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,010
a makeup artist and their makeup artist

90
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:06,709
that use a lot of heavy you know

91
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,970
foundations and stuff like that and

92
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:12,300
literally I just feel like I look better

93
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:14,700
with like less makeup it looks so crazy

94
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:17,519
and like you know they're professional

95
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:20,100
so I'm thinking like I just don't have a

96
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,410
face where it can take a lot of makeup

97
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:25,020
like I am so mesmerized I love

98
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:27,270
nikkietutorials she's so good but like

99
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:29,550
the amount of makeup that she use and

100
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:32,580
manages for it to look so flawless like

101
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:34,950
damn she is so talented but I feel like

102
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,930
my I would love for her to do my makeup

103
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:38,820
just to see if I'm capable of wearing

104
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:41,580
that much makeup because I honestly feel

105
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:44,250
like I just don't like my face can't

106
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:46,229
take it anyways let's continue on I'm

107
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:49,350
gonna set that with this Laura Mercier

108
00:04:46,229 --> 00:04:52,650
this is the candle glow that sheer

109
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:54,210
powder that I've been loving lately it's

110
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:56,370
a nice one to just kind of set

111
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:58,380
everything while still remaining very

112
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:01,650
luminous and doesn't that look so dark I

113
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:04,680
think I because they sent me a bunch of

114
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:08,190
these and I think I gave away my shame

115
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:12,240
too by accident but it's fine - this one

116
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:14,880
it's so sure that it kind of goes if it

117
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,130
makes me a little tan I'm kind of okay

118
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,200
with that so now we're gonna move right

119
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:20,970
into eyeshadow so I'm gonna take this

120
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,610
huda beauty palette and this is the

121
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:25,410
color suede and it's literally like a

122
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:27,270
grey brown as well that's why I wanted

123
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:30,210
to choose it just because the Natasha

124
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:33,300
didn't own a crystal topcoat it kind of

125
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:36,680
goes on sheer like it's exactly what

126
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,680
it's a good top coat you know

127
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:45,080
it's really pretty isn't it like just by

128
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:49,580
itself I would do this even and do like

129
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:51,440
a wing liner but have it be smudgy oh

130
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:53,240
that would be such a cool like rocker

131
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,449
eye what's nice is because we're gonna

132
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:58,909
put the top coat it literally beautifies

133
00:05:56,449 --> 00:06:01,340
the eye so you can kind of be messy

134
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:04,819
about it I kind of sat there and blended

135
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:06,530
for a bit but I mean honestly you don't

136
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:11,960
really need to that was just me being

137
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:13,970
crazy yeah this is a clean brush now do

138
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:19,520
that and I'm gonna go right into that

139
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:21,199
suede color again so now I'm gonna take

140
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,729
another brush and I'm gonna take this

141
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:30,159
color called BAE Beijing and use that to

142
00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:34,039
just kind of highlight the brow bone oh

143
00:06:30,159 --> 00:06:35,990
this is why I should do my eyebrows yeah

144
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:37,610
we're gonna do my eyebrows now I'm going

145
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:40,969
to take the colour-pop pencil brush

146
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:42,409
these guys out really quickly you guys

147
00:06:40,969 --> 00:06:45,169
already know I need to fill in those

148
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:53,029
gaps that I have so I don't look all

149
00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:53,990
chewed up brush it out again maintaining

150
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:58,520
the ones in the front

151
00:06:53,990 --> 00:07:00,969
somewhat natural these are so curly

152
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,969
right here

153
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:09,849
so I didn't use boy bra that night

154
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:13,930
actually I used this I've been really

155
00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:16,270
liking the ico one for these events that

156
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:18,639
I've been going to it literally looks

157
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:20,199
like mascara guys it's like so big

158
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,990
compared to like any of the other brow

159
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:27,180
gels and stuff that I've tried but this

160
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:30,460
one gives you like super dimension and

161
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:32,800
it leaves them kind of glassy so I like

162
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:36,610
that that's why I like it mainly because

163
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:40,800
it kind of leaves them glossy and I feel

164
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:44,560
like that looks very very groomed and

165
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:48,720
expensive the only bad thing about this

166
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:51,729
or what I don't like about it is that

167
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,220
it's hard it leaves your eyebrows very

168
00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:55,900
stiff and you feel it when you're

169
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:57,880
washing your face and stuff so I don't

170
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:00,699
really love that but I feel like it's

171
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:02,110
okay for events and stuff like a night

172
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:06,720
out because you're only out for like

173
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:14,710
maybe four or five hours or - oh yeah

174
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:17,560
but it gives you a lot of so those are

175
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:20,199
my filled in and very groomed to brows

176
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:22,740
let's finish up this shadow that I was

177
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:31,599
talking about so I'm gonna take bay and

178
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:33,820
now we can really get in there I want to

179
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,919
take one of these little guys and go

180
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:37,659
into that same I'm I just use this

181
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:41,050
palette for the whole look I'm gonna use

182
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:45,010
the sandalwood it's like a warm light

183
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:47,980
orange e Brown and I actually applied

184
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:52,029
this first so we're gonna go back I

185
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:57,310
forgot we're gonna go back over it with

186
00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:59,890
the gray Brown that color suede but

187
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:03,130
first I did this because honestly I

188
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:07,260
don't really love the way I look with

189
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:11,020
cool tone colors I feel like I look

190
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:12,579
really paced the undead I mean it's fun

191
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:14,230
for a night out though but I still

192
00:09:12,579 --> 00:09:17,529
wanted to add it just a little bit of

193
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:19,130
warmth where I could and also right in

194
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:22,130
here and

195
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:24,050
we'll go over just so that the gray is

196
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:27,380
actually the main one but this is just

197
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:32,330
kind of peeking through so I'm grabbing

198
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:44,050
that suede on a fluffy brush just to

199
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:47,060
blend and then again for the bottom I

200
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:50,180
want it to be very very soft like not

201
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:52,550
too harsh or like a smoky smoky all

202
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:56,390
right but you know what I did actually

203
00:09:52,550 --> 00:10:00,230
add some black into the mix so I'm gonna

204
00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:02,570
take that baby brush again and this

205
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:08,600
color here it's just a black it's called

206
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:12,290
black truffle I just placed it right on

207
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:19,490
the outer and here with my lash line

208
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:24,440
just like that and then also right on

209
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:26,800
top kind of like a liner but more smoked

210
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,800
out

211
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:32,560
so I'm gonna bronze my face now I'm

212
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:38,560
gonna use the Estee Lauder and Victoria

213
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:42,430
Beckham bronzer I'm just going into the

214
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:45,130
usual bronzing spots I'm just gonna add

215
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:47,440
a little bit to my nose so what I used

216
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:51,370
for blush was actually this guy called

217
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:54,970
Lovejoy and it is a mineralized blush by

218
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:57,330
Mac looks like this yeah I'm gonna leave

219
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:57,330
that

220
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:11,130
I think I went for like ugliest face

221
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:14,100
while applying blush for sure I just

222
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:18,510
like of my cheeks I'm very hard to

223
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:20,090
define to make all kinds of crazy faces

224
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:23,190
to find them

225
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:25,320
so then I'm gonna put the highlighter on

226
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:27,780
I'm gonna use a powder highlighter this

227
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,750
is the laura mercier highlight and one

228
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:32,700
this was like my ride-or-die for a

229
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:35,820
really good whole year I'm surprised

230
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:37,110
that it has not even a dent in it like

231
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,660
I'm literally hard this for like two

232
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:41,640
years that's crazy okay so I'm gonna

233
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:49,740
apply that this is the fenty brush how

234
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:56,840
pretty is this by the way so that's what

235
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:59,970
I used first and I like using this one

236
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:04,110
for like photos at night and stuff

237
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:06,680
because it doesn't photograph crazy it's

238
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:09,240
like very natural in a way even though

239
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:18,330
it's not that natural so now I'm gonna

240
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:20,040
set all of that with the spray again so

241
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:22,530
jumping back into eyes actually I'm

242
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,600
gonna add just a little bit more of the

243
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:28,170
black this one's great this is the

244
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:30,780
three-in-one brush from Aiko and it's so

245
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:32,730
cool because you literally have every

246
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:34,860
brush to really help define your eyes

247
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:40,260
like you can line it and stuff

248
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:43,110
I forgot I used this one so it really

249
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:46,280
packs the black in a lot better than

250
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:50,010
just like the fluffier one that I used

251
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:52,550
this one why isn't the black that

252
00:12:50,010 --> 00:13:02,430
intense yeah so it has like a little guy

253
00:12:52,550 --> 00:13:05,270
this different one - do you notice I say

254
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:05,270
little guy for everything

255
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:09,810
and I'm gonna tight line with this

256
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:12,620
master Kajal this is from Maybelline

257
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:15,050
really really good highly recommended I

258
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:17,280
love me a cush all to tight line

259
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:20,100
especially you couldn't really get up in

260
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:22,160
there without tugging or anything like

261
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,160
that

262
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:34,630
and then for the waterline I used a

263
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:36,370
beige one because I like to come as B so

264
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:39,610
now for the inner corner you know that

265
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:43,209
never goes untouched I'm using the off

266
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:46,959
tropic by color pop so taking that on a

267
00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:48,399
small little brush I'm just going to hit

268
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:52,600
that tear duct with it

269
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:56,470
I love this one because it like works

270
00:13:52,600 --> 00:14:00,089
with both cool tone and warm tone it's

271
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:02,500
just like the perfect little highlight

272
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:05,410
especially if you are a little watery

273
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:08,529
there and it mixes in with like your

274
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:12,690
actual tears down like you've got such a

275
00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:14,529
good beam sometimes I exaggerate it

276
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:15,850
sometimes like oh you kind of like

277
00:14:14,529 --> 00:14:17,080
something wide in the center I'm like

278
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:20,140
yeah I know it's my inner corner

279
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:22,540
highlight I didn't blend it out because

280
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:24,430
I wanted it to really pop hmm so now we

281
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:27,130
get to play around with the top coat I

282
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:29,830
am so excited about this product so

283
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:32,770
obsessed you guys it's the perfect like

284
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:34,240
topper to just complete any look

285
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:35,650
especially for a night out the reason I

286
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,589
picked it up was because my friend

287
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:41,200
Melissa who I met on a shoot actually

288
00:14:38,589 --> 00:14:43,600
she did my makeup for the line you know

289
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,940
way so wait transform me into Cher and I

290
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,500
was like Melissa was with color pops the

291
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:49,120
color pop provided all like the

292
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,650
cosmetics and stuff she literally

293
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,140
murdered my face and all supposed to

294
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:54,760
like kind of you know imitate the next I

295
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:56,980
and oh my gosh it was I was so

296
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,900
intimidated she was the one I was like

297
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,400
following her into stories she's so

298
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,650
funny I'll leave her handle here so you

299
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:06,279
guys can follow her she's hilarious but

300
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:08,829
she was out at Sephora hunting this down

301
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:10,779
and I was like what it's like of a big

302
00:15:08,829 --> 00:15:13,240
deal about it and when she revealed like

303
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:13,959
the swatches I was like ah I need that

304
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,630
in my life

305
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:19,899
I absolutely need it so picked it up of

306
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:22,570
course and a lot of other things that

307
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:27,100
she recommended actually I love her

308
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:31,230
style of makeup so I liked her

309
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:34,300
recommendations so you can build it up

310
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:37,340
so I build it up a lot that night you

311
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:40,700
could it can be like more sheer or like

312
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:44,510
packed with glitter so I've built it up

313
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:46,700
pretty heavily that night and it's still

314
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:50,210
subtle though like to the touch it

315
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:52,880
almost feels not exactly like this color

316
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:55,580
pop shadow but kind of where it almost

317
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,380
feels wet but it's like definitely like

318
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,880
a dry powder so that's what it looks

319
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:00,770
like I've already gone into the pot

320
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,170
quite a bit if you want your makeup to

321
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:05,810
make a statement like have it be a look

322
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:08,270
but like no effort this is definitely

323
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:10,280
the way to do it and this color is

324
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:13,760
really really cool I think it looks kind

325
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:18,440
of like grungy but at the same time like

326
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:20,330
chic AF it definitely picks up way way

327
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,940
better on your finger I would highly

328
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:25,580
recommend using your finger so those are

329
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:27,560
the eyes I'm so obsessed with this

330
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:31,340
Natasha - no no I want to buy there's

331
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:32,540
four shades total so I'll show you the

332
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,400
peach one on the next one I'll probably

333
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:36,740
just end up keeping it now just by the

334
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,870
nude one as well what's the other one oh

335
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:42,260
bronze of course bronze is gonna look

336
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:43,790
beautiful as well so I feel like you

337
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:45,350
really can't go wrong the only thing is

338
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:47,270
like I wish they were just cheaper I

339
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:49,190
think they're 30 I'm like I wish they

340
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:52,730
were like 20 and I wouldn't feel as bad

341
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:55,640
getting all four of them but anyways so

342
00:16:52,730 --> 00:17:04,520
I'm just gonna use this Marc Jacobs

343
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:08,330
mascara mascara okay so for lips

344
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:12,530
actually let me apply I'm gonna use a

345
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:17,120
liquid lip so I'm gonna apply this this

346
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:21,830
is from L'Occitane and I like this one

347
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:26,510
under not sticks because it's very it's

348
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:28,940
hydrating but it's very thin I love the

349
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:32,150
thicker like I love a balm calm but

350
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:35,120
sometimes they're too thick so it really

351
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:36,800
takes away from like it just transformed

352
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,860
the liquid lip into something else where

353
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:42,440
this is thinner so it doesn't really

354
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:44,960
like add too much shine like you know

355
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,720
this looks kind of matte so to continue

356
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,600
this like cool tone

357
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:52,539
I'm taking point zero this is the color

358
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:55,840
pop with kathleenlights there's a moment

359
00:17:52,539 --> 00:18:00,570
I was using it a lot like last fall and

360
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:05,250
I haven't really touched it since but I

361
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:05,250
thought it was perfect for this look so

362
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:11,320
then I added a gloss because I felt like

363
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:13,960
these cool tones make me look kind of

364
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:16,360
dead so Mike oh no I need like I need a

365
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:19,210
gloss I can't be like mad and cool tone

366
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:22,299
like I just look super dead so I took

367
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:26,950
this one this is by Laura Mercier and

368
00:18:22,299 --> 00:18:28,179
it's called a little rose gold accent I

369
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:31,179
don't know it has like little tiny

370
00:18:28,179 --> 00:18:37,179
flecks of glitter in here and I just

371
00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:39,039
planted that in the center my last

372
00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:41,049
little finishing touch because I felt

373
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:43,929
like my face was like looking a little

374
00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:47,320
bit too matte so I took the face gloss

375
00:18:43,929 --> 00:18:51,570
by make so good so I just kind of do

376
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:51,570
this and then I do that

377
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:03,110

do a little networking here on YouTube

399
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:01,440

definitely like I have so many so many

405
