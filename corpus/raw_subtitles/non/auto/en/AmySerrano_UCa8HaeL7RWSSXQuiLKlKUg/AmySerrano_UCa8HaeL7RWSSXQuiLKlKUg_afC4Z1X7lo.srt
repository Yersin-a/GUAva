was super young I wanted to be a taxi

67
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:47,570
driver or sawgrass Paulo which is like a

68
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,330
snow cone in Panama because I would see

69
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:52,190
them collect cash money like directly

70
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:54,350
into their hands and I just I wanted

71
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:56,300
that money in my hands right my absolute

72
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:58,220
favorite show is Shark Tank I don't like

73
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,620
being around super negative people I

74
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:02,450
think because I'm so aware of it it just

75
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:05,959
bugs the crap out of me like if they're

76
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:08,120
just constantly like no don't come

77
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:10,340
around me with that um just makes me

78
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,800
kind of sad for those types of people to

79
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:14,660
be honest I have a super super super

80
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,250
addictive personality when I get into

81
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:19,160
something I need to know every little

82
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:21,730
single detail about it a little bit I'm

83
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:24,709
a little crazy in that sense I love iced

84
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:26,480
Americanos like just straight up black

85
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:27,980
but if I have hot coffee I need to have

86
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,620
like a little bit of almond milk and

87
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:33,650
cinnamon I have a mega girl crush on

88
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:35,810
Mila Kunis I'm deathly afraid to hold

89
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:37,640
newborns I don't know how to hold a baby

90
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:40,340
you know from here like oh he's so cute

91
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:42,950
he's so cute but do not pass him over to

92
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:45,620
me because I am like this paralyzed like

93
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:46,940
I won't move I'm so scared to hold a

94
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,100
baby I don't know if you guys can

95
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:51,769
already tell but I am very animated with

96
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:53,330
my facial expression so I'm like when

97
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:55,340
I'm surprised on the rise like you know

98
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:57,500
when I'm mad like you can just see it on

99
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:59,510
my face I'm very easy to read I love

100
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,340
love love spicy food I know this might

101
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:02,959
sound a little weird but when my lips

102
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:04,390
are burning after eating something

103
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,430
that's like a good

104
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:08,290
for me I love it and my favorite chili

105
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:10,690
is habanero it hurts me when I see

106
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:12,310
people yell at anybody in like a service

107
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:15,520
type of industry I hate it

108
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:17,140
it irks me so so much I love traveling

109
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,609
the ultimate trip for me would

110
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:21,519
definitely be Tokyo I just love

111
00:04:18,609 --> 00:04:24,340
everything about that culture and love

112
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,750

115
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:30,100
my favorite trip that I have taken is

116
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,470
definitely a tie between Peru and Kenya

117
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,750
hands down my dream wardrobe would be

118
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:36,760
anything each sailor on I love each

119
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,980

120
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:41,140
being super flat-chested but I actually

121
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:44,080
really love small boobs so I never

122
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:46,510
really cared I have the biggest biggest

123
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,540

134
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,280
the movie that really got me into

135
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:14,380
fashion I think like I mean I was super

136
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,570
young when I saw it but I was like oh my

137
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,310
god like the way they match up the

138
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:20,530
clothes with the revolt of closet oh my

139
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:22,720
gosh I got a ride I don't know I love

140
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:24,700
fashion after that I used to never cry

141
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,680
for anything like nothing nothing would

142
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:29,169
make me cry nothing sad would make me

143
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,060
cry and now I cry for anything and

144
00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:33,070
everything oh my gosh if somebody got a

145
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:35,260
deal on shark tank I'm crying but I

146
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:39,160
mainly cry if it's something like happy

147
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:41,110
thank you birth control made me crazy I

148
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,900
love watching documentaries Anthony

149
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:46,690
Bourdain is my hero my number-one hero I

150
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:48,640
can put avocado on everything and

151
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:50,140
anything if it's like a weird mix like

152
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,150
if it's desert or something like that my

153
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:53,320
theory is if I can't put avocado on it I

154
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:56,320
can probably put peanut butter on it

155
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:58,630
love peanut butter love avocado I read a

156
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:01,360
ton of nonfiction but my favorite book

157
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:03,310
of all time is the outsiders the only

158
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,500
book I really read more than once love

be a meteorologist actually when I was

172
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:34,539
younger when I used to work with Katy

Little Miss Perfect I am a super

175
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:39,970
perfectionist especially when it comes

182
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:53,949
favorite movies of all time because it

183
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:55,539
reminds me so much of my sister we used

184
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:58,659
to reenact the entire movie and I can

185
00:06:55,539 --> 00:07:00,099
still quote it like verbatim I'm pretty

186
00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:03,250
adventurous when it comes to food but I

187
00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:06,039
can't do anything slimy like a little up

188
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:07,659
I consider myself to be a son child I

189
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:10,030
just feel super connected to the Sun I

190
00:07:07,659 --> 00:07:12,490
am so not a gym person I hate going to

191
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:15,190
an enclosed space I'd rather go for a

192
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:15,849
hike or do Zumba the music just makes me

193
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,620
feel alive

194
00:07:15,849 --> 00:07:19,900
I went to a small Catholic High School

195
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:22,449
and we had to wear uniform that guy's

196
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:24,520
like I have to go to a small Catholic

197
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:26,139
High School and headwear uniform every

198
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:28,060
day and I actually came to really really

199
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:29,529
love it I love love love mangoes and I

200
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,690
would probably eat them more if I knew

201
00:07:29,529 --> 00:07:33,279
how to peel and cut them I just I don't

202
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:35,500
know how to cut them I've YouTubed it

203
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:37,389
and I just can't seem to get it together

204
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:40,659
I used to think that I was gonna marry

205
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:41,979
Adam Brody from The OC Seth Cohen I used

206
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:44,080
to think I was gonna marry him I really

207
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:46,930
did when I saw that he married Lee

208
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,599
Leighton Meester my heart dropped I kid

209
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:52,240
you not my heart sank to my the bottom

210
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:54,550
of my stomach I'm addicted to vegan

211
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,949
peanut butter ice cream from Van Leeuwen

212
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:58,870
lewin I don't know how to say the

213
00:07:56,949 --> 00:08:01,120
freaking place but I go there so much

214
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:03,550
and I am not even vegan I just I love

215
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,430
that ice cream song so much mary-kate

216
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:08,860
and Ashley are definitely the twins that

217
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:11,050
inspired me to want to travel the world

218
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:13,930
all their straight-to-video movies

219
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:16,899
passport to Paris our lips are sealed

220
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:17,800
winning London all those movies made me

221
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:19,120
want to travel and I

222
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,259
thought I was gonna meet like a hot guy

223
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,129
everywhere I went so not the case

224
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:26,560
delusional delusional

225
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:28,629
I love reading but I get so excited for

226
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,340
new books so instead of finishing that

227
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:31,690
book then I'll start the no new book

228
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,649
because I'm so excited and then I'll

229
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:34,419
read a little bit and then I'll get a

230
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:36,250
new book and then so I have a lot of

231
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:37,870
unfinished books it's really bad I'm

232
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,969
trying to be better about that and

233
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:43,060
trying to finish the books that I start

234
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:45,459
I love linguistics I love language I

235
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:47,470
always wish I had better vocabulary I'm

236
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:49,000
obsessed with vocabulary when I was

237
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:50,560
younger I would write down all the new

238
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,269
words if I was reading a book or

239
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,100
listening to a song and I loved that

240
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:56,290
word I would write it down in this like

241
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:58,450
little journal that I made and define

242
00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:02,140
them and try to use them in sentences I

243
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:03,760
was kind of a nerd I'm very like turned

244
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:07,240
on I don't know if turned on is the

245
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:11,680
right word but I really love people who

246
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:13,810
can speak eloquently I'm such a fan of

247
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,300
people who can speak eloquently that is

248
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:20,019
why I like Matt Lauer that is why I like

249
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:23,380
Colin coward I love listening to people

250
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:25,720
with I don't know good voices I hate my

251
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:27,970
voice I'm so lucky being my little voice

252
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,470
is so annoying I think that's how we all

253
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:31,300
are right everybody hates to hear the

254
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:32,980
