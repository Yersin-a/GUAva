1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,160
hey I'm a geek a

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:05,160
so I have taken a

3
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:09,719
23andme

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:13,530
DNA test recently and

5
00:00:09,709 --> 00:00:13,530
today I am going

6
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:16,500
to open it and find

7
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,500
out the results

8
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:19,439
basically I've wanted

9
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:19,439
to do one of these

10
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,270
DNA tests for so

11
00:00:19,429 --> 00:00:21,270
long like years and

12
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,939
years and years before

13
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,939
they were popular

14
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:26,699
I wanted to do one

15
00:00:23,929 --> 00:00:26,699
and then a few years

16
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:30,150
ago they became really

17
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:30,150
popular and like

18
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:33,210
every youtuber out

19
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,210
there was doing a DNA

20
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:36,450
test but I was living

21
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,450
in Japan and they

22
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:38,129
don't really ship to

23
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,129
Japan but now that

24
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:41,309
I'm back in Canada I

25
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:41,309
can actually do one

26
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:45,960
of these tests and

27
00:00:41,299 --> 00:00:45,960
yeah so I saw an

28
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:50,550
advertisement that

29
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:50,550
they were on sale it

30
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:53,340
was like a 50% sale

31
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,340
and I was like yo

32
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:55,500
now is my chance I can

33
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,500
save you know 100

34
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:59,820
in something dollars

35
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:59,820
because it's 50%

36
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:03,300
off right now and

37
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:03,300
yeah maybe to 2 to 3

38
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:07,110
weeks ago I mailed

39
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:07,110
it off and I got an

40
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:11,430
email yesterday the

41
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:11,430
day before um that

42
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:13,770
my results have come

43
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,770
in and I can you

44
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,890
know check out my

45
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,890
results being a

46
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:19,200
traveler and coming

47
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,200
from a country like

48
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,720
Canada no matter what

49
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:21,720
you look like you

50
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,280
kind of get the

51
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,280
question like what are

52
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,380
you really like what's

53
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:25,380
your background

54
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,590
what's your ethnicity

55
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:28,590
what goes on there

56
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:31,200
and the best answer

57
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,200
I could give is

58
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:34,409
generic white girl I

59
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:34,409
don't really know

60
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,450
like what kind of

61
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:36,450
white girl I am and

62
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:38,850
when people ask

63
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,850
like oh what's your

64
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:41,310
background and you

65
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,310
just say generic

66
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:44,399
white girl um it's a little

67
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:48,540
disappointing and it's a little

68
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:52,140
lackluster and people

69
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:52,140
are like oh okay

70
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:54,210
like you don't have

71
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,210
a better answer you

72
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,880
don't know what kind

73
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,880
of white girl you

74
00:01:54,210 --> 00:02:00,000
are ya know I actually

75
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:00,000
don't I feel like

76
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,340
it's probably a common

77
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:02,340
thing if you're

78
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,140
from a country like

79
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,140
Canada that is based

80
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:08,429
off of immigration

81
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:08,429
and you're clearly

82
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:10,649
not native you don't

83
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,649
really know what

84
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:13,120
your background is

85
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,120
when you're you know

86
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:16,060
a 5th 6th generation

87
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,940
born and raised

88
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,940
Canadian like me we

89
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:23,379
can't really like

90
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:23,379
pinpoint the specific

91
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:25,450
person or people who

92
00:02:23,369 --> 00:02:25,450
emigrated to Canada

93
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:29,530
that information has

94
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,530
just kind of been

95
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:31,690
lost over the generations

96
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,690
in my case and

97
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:33,700
like my predictions

98
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,700
and what I think

99
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:37,000
this is gonna say

100
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:37,000
based on the very

101
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:39,970
little bit of

102
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,970
information I know I'm

103
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,659
definitely Irish and

104
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,659
that is the only

105
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:47,160
person that we can

106
00:02:43,649 --> 00:02:47,160
specifically put to

107
00:02:43,659 --> 00:02:49,390
another country that's

108
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,390
not Canada is my

109
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:53,200
great-grandmother so my mother's

110
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:58,060
mother's mother

111
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:58,060
immigrated from Ireland

112
00:02:53,200 --> 00:03:00,879
and besides that we

113
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,879
can't pinpoint a

114
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:06,269
specific person so

115
00:03:00,869 --> 00:03:06,269
the rest of its kind

116
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:09,549
of just furies based

117
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:09,549
off of surnames or

118
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:12,159
little tidbits of

119
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:12,159
information that has

120
00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:14,440
trickled down there

121
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:14,440
the generations so

122
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:17,230
I'm definitely Irish

123
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,230
and also on my

124
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:20,950
mom's side I have

125
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,950
heard some Scottish

126
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:24,040
potentially and some

127
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,040
German potentially

128
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:27,190
on my dad's side

129
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,190
we are definitely

130
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:31,019
Scottish even though

131
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,019
we can't pinpoint

132
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:34,840
the person that

133
00:03:31,009 --> 00:03:34,840
emigrated we do still

134
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:37,470
know our family crest and my

135
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:44,470
grandmother's maiden

136
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:44,470
name is still very

137
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:45,699
Scottish and my surname

138
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,699
um so the name

139
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:50,079
that's been passed

140
00:03:45,689 --> 00:03:50,079
down through the

141
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:55,349
mails to me that is

142
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:55,349
very very English

143
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:57,129
sounding so we're

144
00:03:55,339 --> 00:03:57,129
assuming it's English

145
00:03:55,349 --> 00:04:00,340
that's what I mean

146
00:03:57,119 --> 00:04:00,340
like we're just kind

147
00:03:57,129 --> 00:04:04,299
of making assumptions

148
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:04,299
off of surnames um

149
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:06,400
so yeah I guess today

150
00:04:04,289 --> 00:04:06,400
we're gonna find

151
00:04:04,299 --> 00:04:09,459
out for sure so when

152
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:09,459
it comes to the

153
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:14,489
actual results what

154
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:14,489
I am predicting is

155
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:17,320
that I am at least

156
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:17,320
75% British Irish

157
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:21,510
around there if I

158
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,510
am less than 75%

159
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:24,190
British Irish I will

160
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,190
be a bit surprised

161
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:26,620
just because of what I said when

162
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:28,840
our assumptions the

163
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,840
little bits we do

164
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:31,810
know I'm assuming

165
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,810
I'm mostly Scottish

166
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:35,890
and Irish a little

167
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,890
bit of English in

168
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:40,090
there so that's why

169
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,090
I'm thinking 75% at

170
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:42,370
least British Irish

171
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,370
and then the rest

172
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:44,830
would be you know

173
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,830
German other Europeans

174
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:47,890
that kind of gets

175
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,890
mixed up in there so

176
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:51,130
I'm gonna go on my

177
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,130
computer and login I

178
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:56,110
have my computer right

179
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,110
here so um I will

180
00:04:51,130 --> 00:05:01,960
film my reaction let's go I am

181
00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:03,610
hello okay so it

182
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,610
sounds like my first

183
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:09,310
thing he had the

184
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,310
ancestry composition

185
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:11,290
I'm only 59% British

186
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,290
Irish okay okay

187
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:18,520
it's very blue so I'm

188
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:18,520
assuming it's very

189
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:24,130
European so I am 99.2%

190
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:24,130
European and of

191
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:28,030
that Northwestern

192
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,030
European is 97.3% cool

193
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:30,250
um so fifty-nine

194
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,250
percent is British

195
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:33,370
Irish which is less

196
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,370
than I was expecting

197
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:36,130
I was thinking a

198
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,130
little more I just

199
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:39,160
clicked on the British

200
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,160
Irish section and

201
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:41,590
it said the United

202
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,590
Kingdom has 165

203
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:44,650
administrative regions

204
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,650
and we found the

205
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:47,380
strongest evidence

206
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,380
your ancestry in the

207
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:49,870
following 10 regions

208
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,870
one being Glasgow

209
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:57,180
City which makes

210
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:57,180
sense I know I am

211
00:05:49,870 --> 00:06:04,120
Scottish and then

212
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:04,120
Greater London Belfast

213
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:05,710
okay what is this the

214
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,710
Highlands that's

215
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,600
what I was kind

216
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,600
of expecting I as

217
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:11,770
expecting like

218
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:11,770
Scottish and then the

219
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,720
Highlands because

220
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,720
um my grandmother's

221
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:17,410
maiden name I said

222
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:17,410
it's very Irish and

223
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:19,780
it's Mackay and one I

224
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,780
looked at some map

225
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:22,930
someone put the map

226
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:22,930
of the UK together

227
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:26,050
or like Scottish

228
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,050
names Mackay is very

229
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:28,630
common in the highlands

230
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,630
traditionally I

231
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:30,790
don't know it was

232
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,790
like a random map I

233
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:33,370
saw him some random

234
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,370
website I don't know

235
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:37,150
if there's any

236
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,150
accuracy oh but that's

237
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:39,810
cool so it's for

238
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,810
some reason London

239
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:43,110
but the rest of its

240
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,110
like northern I

241
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:46,510
sorry northern England

242
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,510
and Scotland and

243
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:49,690
then there's Ireland

244
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,690
my likely matches

245
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:53,010
in Ireland are Dublin

246
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,010
which is a place

247
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:56,740
my great grandmother

248
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,740
is from is Dublin

249
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:58,180
but also quark okay

250
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,180
that's cool I like

251
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:00,220
how they break that

252
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:00,220
down a little bit

253
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:04,870
but let's go back and

254
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:04,870
look at the other

255
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:10,030
parts of my ancestry

256
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:10,030
so 18% French and

257
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:12,220
German and then Oh

258
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,220
Scandinavian capital

259
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:15,190
region of dent so

260
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:15,190
mostly Danish I guess

261
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:16,000
two point one percent

262
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,000
Danish okay I'm

263
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:20,320
cool with that

264
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,960
and then 18.2% broadly

265
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,960
north western

266
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:25,510
european moving down

267
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,510
a little bit more i

268
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:30,760
have southern european

269
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:30,760
which is only

270
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:35,380
0.5% spanish and

271
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:35,380
portuguese okay and

272
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:40,139
then 0.5% broadly

273
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:40,139
Western Asia and North

274
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:43,120
African and then 0.3% unassigned

275
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:45,160
interesting

276
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:45,160
interesting here your

277
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,740
ancestry timeline how

278
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,740
many generations

279
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:51,599
ago was your most

280
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:51,599
recent ancestor for

281
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:59,310
each population so

282
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:59,310
because I'm so very

283
00:07:51,599 --> 00:08:02,860
um British Irish yep

284
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,860
one generation ago

285
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:03,970
this is like are you

286
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:03,970
most likely had a

287
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:06,039
parent grandparent or a great

288
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:10,660
grandparent who was

289
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:10,660
100% British and

290
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:14,229
Irish absolutely yeah

291
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:14,229
um like I said my

292
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:15,910
great-grandmother was

293
00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:15,910
absolutely Irish

294
00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:18,699
and I'm pretty sure

295
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,699
she married someone

296
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:21,370
who was Scottish I

297
00:08:18,689 --> 00:08:21,370
think that's where

298
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:22,599
the Scottish came in

299
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,599
on my mum's side so

300
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:26,590
that would mean my

301
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:26,590
grandmother would

302
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:30,460
fall under British

303
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:30,460
and Irish 100% and I

304
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:33,339
think on my mom's bad

305
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:33,339
side is where the

306
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:38,169
German came in which

307
00:08:33,329 --> 00:08:38,169
would make sense

308
00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:41,860
that two to four

309
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,860
generations ago someone

310
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:44,320
was 100% French and

311
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,320
German it all makes

312
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:46,360
sense these stories

313
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:46,360
and myths that have

314
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,150
been passed down in

315
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:49,150
my family totally

316
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,540
makes sense there's

317
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:49,540
very few surprises

318
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:52,070
here

319
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:54,320
the Spanish and

320
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,320
Portuguese is a little

321
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:56,779
bit more surprising

322
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,390
I wasn't expecting

323
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:59,390
Spanish Spanish and

324
00:08:56,779 --> 00:09:02,060
Italian are actually

325
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,060
what I am asked if

326
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:03,620
I am most like are

327
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:03,620
you Spanish are you

328
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:06,110
Italian that's what

329
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,110
they assume my

330
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:09,350
ancestry is I'm like

331
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,350
pretty sure and

332
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:11,390
British and Irish

333
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,390
Scandinavians also

334
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:14,649
kind of strange

335
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,649
I've never heard of

336
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:17,810
anyone on either

337
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:17,810
side my family being

338
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:19,790
Scandinavian cool

339
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:23,540
okay coca-cola so I

340
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:23,540
guess about to my

341
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:26,660
ancestry um yeah not

342
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:26,660
really surprised at

343
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:29,830
all I guess I was kind

344
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,830
of assuming there

345
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:33,529
would be more British

346
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,529
and Irish and less

347
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:34,810
German but overall are not that

348
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:38,720
surprised

349
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:43,220
yeah good on my

350
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:43,220
family for having an

351
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:46,850
accurate myths passed

352
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:46,850
down I guess and I

353
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:51,709
do like that how in

354
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:51,709
a under the British

355
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:56,570
and Irish like

356
00:09:51,699 --> 00:09:56,570
Subsection like the two

357
00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:58,670
main regions that pop

358
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,670
up are Glasgow and

359
00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:00,980
Dublin which would

360
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,980
make a lot of sense

361
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:04,220
being Scottish and

362
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:04,220
Irish went through

363
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:08,570
what I assumed I

364
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:08,570
was I was you know

365
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:13,459
mostly Scottish a lot

366
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,459
Irish and then a

367
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:20,020
little bit of German

368
00:10:13,449 --> 00:10:20,020
cool maternal

369
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:23,000
haplogroup h19 the

370
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:23,000
maternal line okay um

371
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:26,589
so I guess they can

372
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:26,589
trace the maternal

373
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,779
line the common ancestor of the

374
00:10:26,589 --> 00:10:33,230
haplogroup H likely

375
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:33,230
lived in the Middle

376
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:35,420
East less than 18,000

377
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,420
years ago during

378
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:38,660
the last great cold

379
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:38,660
period of the Ice

380
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:40,070
Age some of her

381
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,070
descendants spread into

382
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,050
Europe which is probably why I'm

383
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:43,970
European

384
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:47,000
haplogroup H and

385
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,000
the Royal lines of

386
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:49,850
Europe am i royalty

387
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:49,850
that'd be cool find

388
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,520
out I'm like royalty

389
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,520
from this because

390
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:53,990
it's a dominant because it is so

391
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,630
dominant in the general European

392
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:59,570
population okay so

393
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,570
we're gonna move on

394
00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:01,449
to the health traits

395
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,449
the reason I went

396
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:02,960
with the 23andme is

397
00:11:01,439 --> 00:11:02,960
that they have the

398
00:11:01,449 --> 00:11:04,460
Wellness and

399
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:07,070
traits which I think

400
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:07,070
are just really

401
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:10,250
interesting so before

402
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:10,250
I end this video

403
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:13,970
I'm gonna kind of go

404
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,970
through and see if

405
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:16,370
there's any weirdness

406
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,370
so alcohol flush

407
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:19,280
reaction unlikely to

408
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,280
flush I do not get

409
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:21,590
read living in Japan

410
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,590
and drinking with

411
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:25,790
like my Japanese

412
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:25,790
co-workers that was

413
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:28,730
always like a joke

414
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,730
because the one like

415
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:31,160
boss guy that I worked

416
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,160
with he but has

417
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:33,650
half a beer and

418
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,650
turn bright red he

419
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:36,760
looked like a tomato

420
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,760
and I wouldn't and

421
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:43,040
they're like a red

422
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:43,040
face and white jeans

423
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:47,090
yep I don't I don't

424
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:47,090
flush caffeine I do

425
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:51,710
consume more caffeine

426
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:51,710
less likely to be

427
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:53,270
a deep sleeper

428
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,270
interesting cuz like I

429
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:55,280
met well I guess I

430
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,280
don't know if I'm a

431
00:11:53,270 --> 00:12:01,610
deep sleeper but I

432
00:11:55,270 --> 00:12:01,610
am a heavy sleeper

433
00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:06,080
like you can't wake

434
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,080
me up bad genetic

435
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:09,440
weight average lactose

436
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:09,440
intolerance I am

437
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:11,990
likely tolerant um

438
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,990
yeah I don't think I

439
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,850
have too many problems

440
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,850
with lactose I do

441
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:15,200
a problem with like

442
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,200
Greek yogurt that's

443
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:19,220
the only thing that

444
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:19,220
seems to give me

445
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:23,270
problems but muscle

446
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:23,270
composition common

447
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:26,960
in power athletes okay

448
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:26,960
let's go back and

449
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:29,630
see so that was the

450
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:29,630
Wellness part and if

451
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:32,390
we go into the traipse

452
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,390
genetics behind

453
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:39,620
my appearance why do

454
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:39,620
people not assume I

455
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:44,180
am generic white girl

456
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:44,180
ability to match

457
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:48,230
musical pitch I

458
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:48,230
don't have musical

459
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:51,650
talent at all less

460
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,650
likely than average

461
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:54,410
to have bunions I

462
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,410
have real I really

463
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:56,150
messed up feet so

464
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,150
they're not bunions

465
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:57,620
but like I've really

466
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,620
weird feet that's

467
00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:01,430
why I usually keep

468
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,430
them covered I'm not

469
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:04,130
a sandals person cheek

470
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:04,130
dimples likely no

471
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:04,700
dimples yeah not

472
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,700
really I just have fat

473
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:07,900
cheeks

474
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,900
there's no dimples there

475
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:14,570
I haven't higher

476
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:14,570
odds of disliking

477
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:15,440
cilantro I don't

478
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,440
really care about

479
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:18,709
cilantro

480
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:23,720
I don't care if

481
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:23,720
it's in or out no

482
00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:26,899
question true um

483
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:26,899
more likely to get

484
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:34,509
dandruff yes thank you

485
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:34,509
detached earlobes

486
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:39,290
don't think my earlobes

487
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,290
are detached I

488
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:43,339
don't know what that

489
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:43,339
means exactly I

490
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:47,180
color is likely brown

491
00:13:43,329 --> 00:13:47,180
or hazel I have

492
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:49,279
like a hazel and green

493
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:49,279
eye yeah if you

494
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:51,889
have heights less

495
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:51,889
likely than average to

496
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,199
be afraid of heights

497
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:53,199
ooh I don't know

498
00:13:51,889 --> 00:13:57,829
about that one

499
00:13:53,199 --> 00:14:00,139
like I don't let the

500
00:13:57,819 --> 00:14:00,139
fear of it stop me

501
00:13:57,829 --> 00:14:03,290
but I have a little

502
00:14:00,129 --> 00:14:03,290
bit afraid of

503
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:06,800
heights more likely

504
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,800
do have a fear of

505
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:10,240
public speaking when

506
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:10,240
I was a kid yes I'm

507
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:15,110
having to do speeches

508
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:15,110
was an awful awful

509
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:18,139
time for me Oh finger

510
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,139
length ratio Mike

511
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:21,740
Lee ring finger

512
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:21,740
longer wait what does

513
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:26,899
that mean longer

514
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:26,899
than what my ring

515
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:28,939
finger than index

516
00:14:26,889 --> 00:14:28,939
finger my ring finger

517
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:32,329
is longer does that

518
00:14:28,929 --> 00:14:32,329
make sense is that

519
00:14:28,939 --> 00:14:33,860
what we're talking

520
00:14:32,319 --> 00:14:33,860
about yes likely ring

521
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:35,569
finger longer they're

522
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,569
almost the same

523
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:37,100
but I think my ring

524
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:37,100
finger is especially

525
00:14:35,569 --> 00:14:41,899
on my left hand

526
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:41,899
my ring finger is

527
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:42,709
definitely longer um

528
00:14:41,889 --> 00:14:42,709
less likely to have

529
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:45,380
flat feet

530
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:48,649
that's very true I

531
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:48,649
have a huge super

532
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:50,990
height art in my

533
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,990
foot gives me some

534
00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:53,959
problems hair texture

535
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,959
likely straight or

536
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:55,790
wavy my hair is

537
00:14:53,949 --> 00:14:55,790
naturally wavy it's

538
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:58,939
definitely not

539
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:58,939
straight but it's not

540
00:14:55,790 --> 00:15:03,559
curly it's it's wavy

541
00:14:58,929 --> 00:15:03,559
less likely to have

542
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:08,089
thick hair I have a

543
00:15:03,549 --> 00:15:08,089
lot of hair but yeah

544
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:09,680
it's pretty thin um

545
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,680
about 50/50 chance

546
00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:13,360
of reverb hello our

547
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:13,360
chocolate ice cream

548
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:18,160
it depends on my mood

549
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:18,160
depends on my mood

550
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:22,309
light or dark hair

551
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:22,309
likely light I

552
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:24,230
definitely have dark

553
00:15:22,299 --> 00:15:24,230
hair my mom has

554
00:15:22,309 --> 00:15:28,040
naturally blonde

555
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:28,040
hair my brother has

556
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:28,529
blond hair and when

557
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:28,529
I was born my mom

558
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,949
was really

559
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:34,649
helping could have

560
00:15:30,939 --> 00:15:34,649
like this cute little

561
00:15:30,949 --> 00:15:36,300
blonde baby and

562
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,300
well I didn't have

563
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:39,060
enough hair until I

564
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:39,060
was like four as a

565
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:43,379
bald child but no I

566
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:43,379
definitely got my

567
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:47,759
duds dark brown hair

568
00:15:43,369 --> 00:15:47,759
red hair Oh likely

569
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:49,350
no red hair interesting

570
00:15:47,749 --> 00:15:49,350
cuz like my hair

571
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,999
is definitely brown

572
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,999
but in certain

573
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:53,399
lights it gets a

574
00:15:50,989 --> 00:15:53,399
little bit of a red

575
00:15:50,999 --> 00:15:54,749
tint and when I talked about my

576
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:56,579
great-grandmother from Ireland

577
00:15:54,749 --> 00:16:00,029
apparently she had

578
00:15:56,569 --> 00:16:00,029
like bright bright

579
00:15:56,579 --> 00:16:03,259
red hair light skin

580
00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:03,259
wow I could have

581
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:06,089
never guessed that

582
00:16:03,249 --> 00:16:06,089
I had lighter skin

583
00:16:03,259 --> 00:16:09,420
totally not what I was

584
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,420
expecting what do

585
00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:11,819
you mean I don't

586
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:11,819
have darks again so

587
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:17,279
glad a DNA test could

588
00:16:11,809 --> 00:16:17,279
tell me I of light

589
00:16:11,819 --> 00:16:19,170
skin likely to prefer

590
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:19,170
salty again it

591
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:21,559
really depends on

592
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,559
my mood there are

593
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:25,410
times when I like super

594
00:16:21,549 --> 00:16:25,410
crave salty food

595
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:28,680
chips especially like

596
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,680
that's what I miss

597
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:32,249
from Japan is like

598
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:32,249
fried lotus root

599
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:35,129
chips those were

600
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:35,129
amazing they're super

601
00:16:32,249 --> 00:16:38,160
salty and crunchy

602
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:38,160
and amazing okay so

603
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:40,800
next what's the oats

604
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,800
do we have likely

605
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,779
second toe longer yes

606
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,779
I have a very long

607
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,639
second toe I pick

608
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:44,639
things up with my feet

609
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:49,079
that's why I say I

610
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:49,079
don't show my feet

611
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:53,910
they're weird-looking

612
00:16:49,069 --> 00:16:53,910
um likely at least

613
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:55,379
a little unibrow I

614
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,379
tweeze my eyebrows

615
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:57,930
like it's no one's business

616
00:16:55,379 --> 00:17:01,889
like bees because

617
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,889
take a good like hour

618
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:04,049
to get in check I

619
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:04,049
should really like if

620
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:07,260
I had money to go get

621
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:07,260
my eyebrows done

622
00:17:04,049 --> 00:17:11,130
professionally I

623
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:11,130
would because it's a

624
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:15,059
lot of meat wake up

625
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,059
time likely to wake

626
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:17,909
up around 8:40 a.m.

627
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:17,909
that is really

628
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:22,740
specific I'm gonna

629
00:17:17,899 --> 00:17:22,740
click on this one why

630
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:26,760
is that so specific

631
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:26,760
I mean it's not

632
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:29,010
wrong like now that

633
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,010
I don't have like a

634
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:33,000
full-time job right

635
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
now and I'm kind of

636
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:34,950
just like doing my

637
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,950
thing online that's

638
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,909
the natural time I

639
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,909
kind of wake up if I

640
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:37,909
don't set an alarm

641
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:46,260
huh interesting

642
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:49,830
why do they say

643
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,830
this our biological

644
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:51,720
sleep rhythm effective

645
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,720
habla okay so

646
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:55,890
apparently I'm a

647
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:55,890
morning person I

648
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:57,750
wouldn't say I'm a

649
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,750
morning person but I

650
00:17:55,890 --> 00:18:00,690
am the most productive

651
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:00,690
in the morning

652
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,350
like if I get up early

653
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,350
and I like just

654
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:03,990
get done

655
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:08,490
I am super productive

656
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:08,490
in the day but I

657
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:11,610
think I'm naturally

658
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,610
a very like night

659
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:14,100
owl kind of person but I guess

660
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:17,010
genetically I'm more

661
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:17,010
inclined to being a

662
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:20,340
morning person cool

663
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,340
cool cool I don't

664
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:23,220
think there's anything

665
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:23,220
else here okay

666
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:26,220
there we go I guess

667
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:26,220
for the other health

668
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:27,600
stuff they like go

669
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:27,600
through disclaimers

670
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,250
me like we're not

671
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,250
diagnosing you with

672
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,890
anything

673
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:35,490
cool it looks like

674
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,490
I'm not I'm not a

675
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:36,450
carrier for any of

676
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,450
those let's check the

677
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:40,940
other what's the other one

678
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:44,600
Health's predisposition

679
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:44,600
I have an Inc

680
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:48,240
increased risk of

681
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:48,240
age-related macular

682
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:51,090
degeneration its

683
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:51,090
age-related so it's

684
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:55,080
probably doesn't

685
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:55,080
matter yet a blurred

686
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:59,640
vision vision loss

687
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:59,640
maybe that's like

688
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:03,180
what my grandma has

689
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:03,180
my grandma's losing

690
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:05,190
her vision um like

691
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,190
her peripheral no

692
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:07,560
she's losing her

693
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,560
central vision but she

694
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:09,600
can still see out

695
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,600
the side something

696
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,400
like that I don't know

697
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,430
it's age-related

698
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:14,430
so I won't have to

699
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:18,780
worry about it until

700
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:18,780
I'm like 50 we're

701
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:22,140
fine celiac disease

702
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:22,140
increased risk late

703
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:26,310
onset Alzheimer's

704
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:26,310
disease slight risk

705
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:29,960
not not really surprised

706
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,960
us any of that

707
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:32,490
I need to look up

708
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:32,490
with this age-related

709
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:34,800
macular degeneration

710
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,800
is I don't know

711
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:37,920
what that is but

712
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:37,920
whatever I'm not really

713
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:42,600
worried about any

714
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:42,600
of it um so yeah I

715
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:46,860
think this is all I

716
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:46,860
can do for now okay

717
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:49,800
so um yeah I guess

718
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:49,800
that is it for this

719
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,670
video there's like

720
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:50,670
a thing here where

721
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,190
you can like fine

722
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:55,980
family members or

723
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,980
whatever but I don't

724
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:57,750
think you need to see

725
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,750
that stuff I don't

726
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:59,070
think that's relevant

727
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,070
to those video and

728
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:02,610
those videos

729
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:02,610
probably long enough

730
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:04,470
already so um yeah

731
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,470
that's it for this

732
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:06,660
video if you liked

733
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,660
