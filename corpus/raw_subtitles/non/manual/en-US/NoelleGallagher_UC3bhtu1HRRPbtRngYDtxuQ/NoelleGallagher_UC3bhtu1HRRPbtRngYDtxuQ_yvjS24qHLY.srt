00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,780
- [Noelle] Thank you Squarespace for sponsoring this video.

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,213
I am so excited to show you all 

3
00:00:05,213 --> 00:00:08,680
how the website is coming together.

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,770
Hello everyone, welcome back to my channel.

5
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:14,542
It's me, Noelle and I'm here to read a joke.

6
00:00:14,542 --> 00:00:16,310
Well, I'm here to do more than that

7
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:18,810
but we're gonna start with this joke.

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,223
What's a hamburger's favorite story to read?

9
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:25,394
Handsel and Gristle,

10
00:00:25,394 --> 00:00:28,370
(laughing loudly)

11
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:29,285
I didn't think ...

12
00:00:29,285 --> 00:00:30,590
(laughing loudly)

13
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:32,300
It didn't look funny on the page

14
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,270
and then when you say it,

15
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:35,690
you know, it just ... It works.

16
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:36,910
So there we have it.

17
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,280
Whoa, so yes hello,

18
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,580
on today's video is going to be the reading habits tag

19
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,250
or my reading habits tag.

20
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,230
And I'm very excited

21
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,680
not only because the questions seem really fun,

22
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,631
but also because I have a very special guest.

23
00:00:52,631 --> 00:00:54,440
(laughing loudly)

24
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,890
I have been without this special guest for a while.

25
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:02,170
And so I'm glad he could make an appearance,

26
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:03,900
the King himself.

27
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,300
So let me just say either ... I mean, let's talk about it.

28
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,920
You can just make your own video

29
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,700
with the same tag questions or in the comments below,

30
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,360
you can either answer all of them

31
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,620
or answer your favorite ones, I don't know.

32
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:20,190
I just, I love hearing how we all slightly ...

33
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,160
Like how we all read slightly differently from each other.

34
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,890
You know, it's an activity that you think

35
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,000
would have no variation and yet we all enjoy

36
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,290
and ingest literature in very different ways.

37
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:34,420
So let's go, I'll also leave the questions

38
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,390
in the description box if you'd like

39
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,230
to see them up close and personal.

40
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,440
So the first question is,

41
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,617
do you have a certain place at home for reading?

42
00:01:42,617 --> 00:01:44,010
(laughing loudly)

43
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:49,010
No, I think I most often read in bed.

44
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,350
If I'm reading a physical book and not listening

45
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,210
to the audio book,

46
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,370
it's gonna be in bed

47
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,990
because I usually like to ...

48
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,350
like if I'm gonna take up the time with reading

49
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,900
then I'd like my boyfriend to at least

50
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,300
like have the main TV

51
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,420
and be able to watch whatever he wants to watch.

52
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,460
So I love reading in bed,

53
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:08,300
but I especially love when I wake up early in the morning

54
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,420
and I just have a cuppa Joe

55
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,447
and I'm laying on the couch

56
00:02:12,447 --> 00:02:15,770
and the heater's on first thing in the morning

57
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,770
and I'm all snuggled up on the couch

58
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,070
or, hey hold on, one more.

59
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:23,480
We also ... I just bought my boyfriend,

60
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,730
I mean, I guess I bought the house

61
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,711
like a chair for the living room and I ...

62
00:02:28,711 --> 00:02:30,890
you know, it was supposed to be a gift for my boyfriend

63
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,610
but it's kind of just my chair now.

64
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,529
And also Parker's chair because I do a lot of reading there.

65
00:02:35,529 --> 00:02:36,910
A lot of annotating,

66
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,350
there's just something about a supported back.

67
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,360
You know what I mean?

68
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,660
Where you are annotating

69
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,760
and you just needed the little extra angle

70
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,560
to really get on that highlighter.

71
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,730
I'm not sure if I'm making sense,

72
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,898
but yes, I read all over the place,

73
00:02:50,898 --> 00:02:54,843
but specifically the bed and the couch and the new chair.

74
00:02:54,843 --> 00:02:55,676
(laughing loudly)

75
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:59,900
Bookmark or random piece of paper?

76
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,430
This is where the controversy of this video

77
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,720
is going to come into play.

78
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,350
Because people have very strong feelings against what I do.

79
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,470
How do I know this?

80
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,670
Well, I often do reading vlogs

81
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:15,530
and whenever people see me do this,

82
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:18,570
I always get comments where people are telling me

83
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,149
how disappointed they are in me.

84
00:03:20,149 --> 00:03:20,982
(laughing loudly)

85
00:03:20,982 --> 00:03:23,850
And that is that, I don't really use bookmarks.

86
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:28,410
I love to dog ear pages, I love it.

87
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,660
It's me making a mark on a book,

88
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,950
like literally marking my own book.

89
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,610
Even if it's not like through highlighting and writing,

90
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,010
which I love doing in books anyway,

91
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,150
but which might be a future question.

92
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,640
I don't actually know, I might be skipping ahead,

93
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,960
but I love a good dog ear.

94
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,930
There's nothing wrong with that.

95
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,410
I'm definitely a dog person anyway.

96
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,709
So ...

97
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:47,542
(laughing loudly)

98
00:03:47,542 --> 00:03:48,510
and I also have noticed that

99
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,700
like I think because I take my books a lot of places

100
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,440
like I might take it with me in the car

101
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,810
or I might take it to my mom's

102
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:57,430
or I might ... I don't know when the gym was open,

103
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,930
I used to take it to the gym.

104
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,730
Bookmarks, just slip right out.

105
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,360
Whereas a dog year never fails.

106
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,307
So ...

107
00:04:04,307 --> 00:04:06,050
(laughing softly)

108
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,120
that's that answer.

109
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,640
Okay, next question.

110
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,750
Can you just stop reading,

111
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,670
or do you have to stop after a chapter

112
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,183
slash a certain amount of pages?

113
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,390
I can stop in the middle of a chapter,

114
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,870
if there are paragraph breaks.

115
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:26,830
I usually always make sure to get to a paragraph break.

116
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,127
I don't, bake.

117
00:04:28,127 --> 00:04:29,030
(laughing loudly)

118
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,730
I usually don't just like stop in the middle of dialogue

119
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,690
or stop in the middle of a description

120
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:37,280
or plot development, cause it just will not make sense to me

121
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,600
when I pick the book back up.

122
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,730
But usually I can stop in the middle of the chapter

123
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,502
as long as there's a clear indication

124
00:04:45,502 --> 00:04:48,640
that there is going to be a new section of the chapter

125
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,709
but I'm not a barbarian, okay.

126
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:51,542
(laughing loudly)

127
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:53,520
I'm not, I won't just stop

128
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,750
in the middle of a dialogue conversation

129
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,870
but I can stop in the middle of the chapter.

130
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,454
Do you eat or ...

131
00:05:00,454 --> 00:05:02,190
(dragging sound)

132
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,104
drink

133
00:05:03,104 --> 00:05:04,978
(laughing softly)

134
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:06,790
while reading?

135
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,040
Yeah, I mean, why not?

136
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,610
Right, like, I don't know.

137
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,530
If I'm gonna dog ear my books anyway,

138
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:12,710
then I don't have a problem

139
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:15,490
with getting like food smudges in my books.

140
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:19,700
Oftentimes if I ever spill water or coffee near a book

141
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,440
I'm almost delighted by it

142
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,720
because I know there's gonna be like

143
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,450
weird crinkling to the pages.

144
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,020
I'm really about ruining a book.

145
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,490
I think it's awesome.

146
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,800
So I'm gonna move her,

147
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,570
move her or I just whack it over.

148
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,940
But yeah, I love eating and drinking.

149
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,960
Well, just in general

150
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,010
but when I read as well.

151
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:40,490
Because if it's already one of my favorite activities,

152
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:41,950
why not combine the two, right?

153
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,270
If I have a cup of coffee,

154
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:46,528
why would I not enjoy it with a nice novel in hand?

155
00:05:46,528 --> 00:05:48,400
(laughs)

156
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,530
And if I'm hungry

157
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:52,610
bitch the pages are not gonna stop me, okay?

158
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:56,190
I love eating Chex Mix bold

159
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,770
while I read, oh God,

160
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:00,340
and I love eating oatmeal in the morning.

161
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,380
So like if I've got my cup of coffee and my oatmeal

162
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,880
and then my book propped up on a knee,

163
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,850
oh my God in my reading chair, are you kidding me?

164
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,540
Absolutely love it.

165
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,770
I love all three of those things.

166
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:16,700
So put your hands together.

167
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:21,010
Multitasking, music or TV while reading?

168
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:24,820
Honey, if you're able to read while the TV is on,

169
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:28,470
I don't understand how your brain functions properly.

170
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:32,070
My brain like skits out when I get literally,

171
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,500
it's like a CD skipping.

172
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,820
If the TV's on, there's no way

173
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,200
that I can pay attention on what I'm ...

174
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,940
pay attention to what I'm reading.

175
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,420
But I often have headphones in while I read,

176
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,750
especially in reading blogs

177
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,230
and people we'll always ask,

178
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:48,729
what on earth could I be listening to while I'm reading?

179
00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:51,070
So the first one is that I'm either just listening

180
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,980
to the audio book while I read.

181
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,390
So while I'm following along,

182
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:57,470
because I think that audio books are such a splendid way

183
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:00,610
to bring a story alive with like character voices

184
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,830
and dialogue and emotion.

185
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,600
I feel like when an audio book is done well,

186
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,519
it really elevates the way you experience story.

187
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:10,260
So oftentimes when you see headphones

188
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,930
in I am listening to an audio book

189
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,180
with the book that I'm reading.

190
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,297
But I also had,

191
00:07:17,297 --> 00:07:22,230
past tense, had an amazing reading playlist on Apple music.

192
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:26,391
But I recently, as in this morning switched over to Spotify

193
00:07:26,391 --> 00:07:31,100
because I was sick and tired of at the end of every year,

194
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,890
having such a shite music wrap-up

195
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,520
compared to all the Spotify users.

196
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,670
I always wanted to know,

197
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,760
like who did I listen to the most this year?

198
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,540
Or like, what was my most played song or album?

199
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,440
It would have been Ariana Grande across the board,

200
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,290
but I still would have liked to see that in numbers.

201
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:51,370
And instead, Spotify users had like blew up Instagram

202
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,340
at the beginning of December of 2020.

203
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,980
And I just was waiting and waiting and waiting.

204
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,760
And then Apple finally launched

205
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,170
some like Market Pantry half-assed version

206
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,410
of what Spotify was doing.

207
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:07,177
And I was like, no, no, I did not get a history degree

208
00:08:07,177 --> 00:08:12,177
to not reflect back on my life in a satisfying way.

209
00:08:12,432 --> 00:08:14,080
So I switched over to Spotify,

210
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,770
which means that I no longer have

211
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,470
my beautifully curated reading playlist.

212
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,660
I did take screenshots of it.

213
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,558
So I'm hoping, that I can go find

214
00:08:21,558 --> 00:08:25,230
all of those songs on Spotify.

215
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,690
And once I do that I'll share a playlist on Instagram

216
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:28,840
because a lot of people have been asking me

217
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,440
to share a reading playlist

218
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:35,229
and I will once I have all of them together.

219
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:39,210
So yeah, that's my thing.

220
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:40,630
I'm either listening to audio books

221
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,840
or I'm listening to a reading playlist

222
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,530
that is only instrumental.

223
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,500
It can be beats, it can be classic,

224
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,920
it can be piano, it can be whatever,

225
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,690
but it can't have any lyrics in it.

226
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:53,600
Cause it is super distracting when I'm reading.

227
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,420
But first, before we get to the next question

228
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,900
let's take a quick break

229
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,930
to thank the sponsor of this video, which is Squarespace.

230
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:00,770
- [Noelle] So as I mentioned

231
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,450
in my previous video with Squarespace,

232
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:06,160
I wanted to make a book review type of website.

233
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,620
So we have a whole page where I will rant

234
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,070
about the books that I really didn't like.

235
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,900
And then we have the raves,

236
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,657
which is, I mean are we surprised

237
00:09:13,657 --> 00:09:16,450
"The Hating Game" and "Misery" are the top two.

238
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,450
And then from the raves,

239
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,490
we have this, which is shop the books,

240
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:20,880
which I thought was a really cute idea.

241
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,240
I would, obviously these are not my T-shirts,

242
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,640
but I would love to instead have books here.

243
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,340
So either the books that I rave about or rant about,

244
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,700
if any of them caught your attention,

245
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,040
I would then link them here,

246
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,300
so that you could click on the book

247
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,750
and then go buy the book on another website

248
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,580
since I don't own these books.

249
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,630
But I just thought it was a cool way

250
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:40,320
to kind of make it a more interactive experience.

251
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,120
If you really liked one of my reviews

252
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,370
you could go read it yourself

253
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,400
and I'd make sure that it was accessible to you.

254
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,820
So there we have it my friends,

255
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,710

259
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,220
Next one book at a time

260
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,070
or several at once?

261
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:02,580
Here's the deal, before starting BookTube,

262
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,720
it was always one at a time.

263
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,840
There was like no way

264
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,350
that I would have been able to focus

265
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,355
on more than one book at a time,

266
00:10:09,355 --> 00:10:11,013
but through ...

267
00:10:11,013 --> 00:10:13,779
I don't know, through BookTube

268
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,400
and through documenting my reading

269
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,070
and just like, I don't know, watching other people's vlogs

270
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,340
and realizing like I guess I kind of thought like,

271
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,400
Oh, when you're reading,

272
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,580
you have to focus entirely on one thing.

273
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,620
You cannot pivot to something else.

274
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,920
And I think once I realized

275
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,300
that that wasn't actually the case

276
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:34,200
and you could actually like be capable of reading a book

277
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,830
realizing you were a little bored

278
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,260
and then pivoting to another book

279
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,700
and returning it to the first book.

280
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,170
I realized that I love to read several books at once.

281
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:46,850
Usually, maybe two, maybe three.

282
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,520
It's usually not over that

283
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,020
because after that point

284
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,500
one of those books is just going to fall off.

285
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,920
But usually like two or three

286
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,440
is my sweet spot for tandem reading.

287
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,030
And it's usually all from a different genre.

288
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,140
So sometimes I'll be like enjoying

289
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,357
like a nice non-fiction and then I'll be like,

290
00:11:03,357 --> 00:11:05,640
"Okay, but I need something to kind of just distract me

291
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,473
for a little bit."

292
00:11:06,473 --> 00:11:08,130
And then I'll like pivot to a romance.

293
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,210
I also would say,

294
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,040
that's a big tip for reading more

295
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,570
is that sometimes when you put yourself in this box

296
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,390
of only reading one book

297
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,900
and you can't switch out of it,

298
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,070
like you've decided I can only read this book

299
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,260
and then you get to a boring part of the book,

300
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,100
then you just don't want to read for a little while.

301
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,170
And so if you end up reading more like two or three books

302
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:29,310
it's easier because then you can like pivot

303
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,960
and be like, okay, I'm in the mood for a romance

304
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,887
and you can finish that book and then be like,

305
00:11:32,887 --> 00:11:34,710
"Oh wait, and now I wanna ...

306
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:35,543
now I'm in the mood

307
00:11:35,543 --> 00:11:37,840
to go finish that memoir I was reading."

308
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,673
Or whatever it is.

309
00:11:38,673 --> 00:11:41,800
So if you've ever wondered how I read so much,

310
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,510
that's definitely a huge tip of mine,

311
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,550
is having several books at once.

312
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:48,350
Reading at home or everywhere?

313
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,070
So realistically,

314
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:53,880
I'd love to be a read anywhere to everywhere girl,

315
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,722
just cause it sounds like super fun.

316
00:11:55,722 --> 00:11:56,555
(laughing loudly)

317
00:11:56,555 --> 00:11:57,388
Like, it just sounds like,

318
00:11:57,388 --> 00:11:58,810
"Oh my God, like it's just me and my books

319
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,270
and we're like on the bus."

320
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:02,410
I mean, right now, obviously there's no way

321
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:03,990
that I could read anywhere but home

322
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,220
because we're all stuck at home.

323
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,040
But I mean, if I'm traveling somewhere,

324
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,040
like I'm gonna be on a plane for five hours,

325
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,600
I'll bring a book.

326
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,680
But like, I feel like when life is open,

327
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,760
I also never like just like go to a cafe by myself.

328
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,730
I just don't do that.

329
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,180
Like I wish I was more like that

330
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,013
but I just ...

331
00:12:21,013 --> 00:12:21,846
I'm like, "Why do that

332
00:12:21,846 --> 00:12:23,520
when I could just read at home

333
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,670
or like be at home and make my own coffee."

334
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,110
So I feel like there wasn't ...

335
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:29,880
if I was going anywhere outside of my house,

336
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,090
it was to either like go to work or go to school

337
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:34,380
or see people that I wanted to spend time with.

338
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:38,795
And so usually, I'm just a home reader

339
00:12:38,795 --> 00:12:43,570
but I wish I was more of a read anywhere, anytime.

340
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:46,130
But usually if I'm out of the house

341
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:47,490
and I need to fill my time,

342
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:49,010
Instagram is just a click away.

343
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,140
So that's what I ended up doing.

344
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:54,500
Okay, question eight, reading out loud

345
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,920
or silently in your head?

346
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,080
Silently in your head.

347
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,610
I've tried reading out loud,

348
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,197
like sometimes when I'm like,

349
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,880
"Oh my God, that audio book was so good.

350
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,850
Maybe I can narrate it better."

351
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,570
And then I try and I'm like, wow, that sucks.

352
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:10,750
So I've tried it, but it's gotta be in the head.

353
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,520
I can never ... I've never been able

354
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,920
to like successfully focus on what I'm reading out loud

355
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,840
when I read out loud

356
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,360
and I always get so scared because in class,

357
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,957
even now in grad school, when people are like,

358
00:13:20,957 --> 00:13:22,657
"Does anyone wanna read that paragraph?"

359
00:13:22,657 --> 00:13:23,608
"Anyone, anyone?"

360
00:13:23,608 --> 00:13:27,071
I'm like "Prof, if you make me read this,

361
00:13:27,071 --> 00:13:30,070
I will not understand what I just read.

362
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:31,130
Because I'll be too anxious

363
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,820
about not tripping over any of my words."

364
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,700
So it's gotta be silently in the head.

365
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:40,463
Question nine, do you read ahead or even skip pages?

366
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,260
Neither, I never skip pages,

367
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,790
I never skip paragraphs, I never skip sentences

368
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,810
because there's kind of like this thing

369
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:50,880
where I feel like if I skip anything

370
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,820
then it's incomplete.

371
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,330
I might do it for school.

372
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:55,110
Like I might skim some paragraphs

373
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:57,000
if I'm like ... It's right before the class

374
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,240
and I needed to finish a chapter or something.

375
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,120
But when I'm reading on my own

376
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,990
if I'm that bored where I need to skip paragraphs

377
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:06,910
or skip ahead, I'm just gonna DNF the book.

378
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,030
I'm not gonna finish it.

379
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:11,530
So if I get to a place where I feel like I'm skipping ahead

380
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:15,320
or skipping details, then it's probably not a book

381
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,830
that I even wanna finish to begin with.

382
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:18,010
So I won't finish it.

383
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,574
Okay. Two more questions.

384
00:14:19,574 --> 00:14:21,390
Breaking the spine

385
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:23,170
or keeping it like new.

386
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:27,150
I mean, we already talked about how I dog ear my books.

387
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:31,507
So I will break spines before I even start reading.

388
00:14:31,507 --> 00:14:34,160
Like just to get the book in a better place.

389
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,230
I actually have one right now.

390
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,063
Hold on.

391
00:14:36,063 --> 00:14:38,660
So I bought this book Little Leaven by Nick Cutter

392
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,370
and it's kind of a thick bitch.

393
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,140
And so it was like a little stiff

394
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,330
before I even started reading.

395
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:44,910
And I was like, "Who cares?"

396
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:48,080
And I just went and broke the spine in multiple places

397
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,970
because I was like, "If I'm going to have

398
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,120
a good reading experience

399
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,060
with this thick ass book,

400
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,500
I'm not going to have this book

401
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,730
that wants to keep shutting on me."

402
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,330
So I literally just sat there and like broke the spine

403
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:00,640
over and over again.

404
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,510
I'm all for it.

405
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:04,110
I think again, it kind of like leaves your mark on it.

406
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,838
I just read a book.

407
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:06,671
What was the book I just read

408
00:15:06,671 --> 00:15:10,210
that talked about used books?

409
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:15,040
I think it was 84 Sharyn Crossroad,

410
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,980
Sharon Crossroad.

411
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:20,150
In any case, I just read a book that talks about used books

412
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,140
and there's like this whole kind of letter

413
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:25,370
that's describing why she loves used books so much.

414
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,360
And what she said was like,

415
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,250
she loves picking up a book

416
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,815
that you can tell was loved by someone else.

417
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,310
And so sometimes when you pick up a used book

418
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:35,290
and it like immediately flips open to a random page

419
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:37,740
you know that the previous reader

420
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,660
really loved a passage from that page.

421
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,460
So you kind of take it time with it a little bit longer.

422
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,410
And so right when I was reading that,

423
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,990
I was like, that was stunning.

424
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,270
I loved how that it was written.

425
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,840
And I just thought that's exactly how it feels

426
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,780
when you have a really well-loved book,

427
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,860
either by yourself or someone else.

428
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,305
It just feels like it's a little more special

429
00:15:57,305 --> 00:16:00,840
because you can feel it like it's a tangible love.

430
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,940
It's not just like, "Oh yeah, I saw that this book

431
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,910
had a really great rating online,

432
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,070
so like, that's why I read it."

433
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:10,310
Instead you can like, hold it and feel how loved it was.

434
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:11,143
I'm not gonna cry.

435
00:16:11,143 --> 00:16:12,520
This mix is not making me,

436
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,440
gonna cry over a fucking book

437
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,980
but I love breaking the spine.

438
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:17,960
I love writing in it.

439
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,538
I love creasing the pages.

440
00:16:19,538 --> 00:16:21,070
I love it all.

441
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:21,903
Oh, wow.

442
00:16:21,903 --> 00:16:25,210
And then the last, last question is, do you write

443
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:26,360
in your books?

444
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,450
And I do.

445
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:29,500
I don't write in every single book

446
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,100
because oftentimes I feel like there's just some books

447
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,920
that I might be loving in the moment or really enjoying

448
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,610
but I just know that I'm not gonna read it again.

449
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:38,860
And so if I'm going ...

450
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,280
If I'm reading a book that I know

451
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,800
I'm going to love and cherish and keep

452
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,277
then I will write all over it.

453
00:16:44,277 --> 00:16:47,020
I'll write stars, I'll write smiley faces.

454
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,960
I'll highlight, I'll write sentences.

455
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,420
I'll talk to myself in the margins.

456
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,820
I'll do it all.

457
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,370
But usually if I know

458
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,850
that it's a book that might not be leaving

459
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,940
a total lasting impression,

460
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,400
then I won't write in it unless it's for school.

461
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,860
And then I need to annotate anyway.

462
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,310
But like with this,

463
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:05,500
I knew within like the first 20 pages

464
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,890
that this was not gonna be a book

465
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:07,723
that I was like,

466
00:17:07,723 --> 00:17:09,120
"Oh my God, I love it so much.

467
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,294
I can't wait to go back in time and see how I felt."

468
00:17:12,294 --> 00:17:15,450
So I'll probably read this and then one day give it away.

469
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,210
And so I'm not gonna write all up in it.

470
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:20,270
But if I was going to look at perhaps ...

471
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:23,650
I don't know let's pick a book off the shelf.

472
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:26,410
Whereas, if I picked up like North and South,

473
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,980
first of all I had to read this for school.

474
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,650
So I already knew that I was going to write in it.

475
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,599
But then once I got like 20 pages in

476
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:35,500
I knew how much I was gonna love this book.

477
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,619
I knew that it was going to be something spectacular

478
00:17:38,619 --> 00:17:42,040
and wonderful and so not only did I just annotate it

479
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,140
'cause I had to for school.

480
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,560
But also I knew that I was gonna wanna

481
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,968
look back on it and see how I felt about it

482
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:51,300
in the years to come.

483
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,990
And so I'm actually planning

484
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,260
on re-reading North and South sometime this year.

485
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,930
And so it'll be really fun

486
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:59,820
to see like what was I really into?

487
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,220
What did I love about it?

488
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,450
What were the passages

489
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,560
that really called to me the first time

490
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,240
so that I can see if they still affect me this time.

491
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,440
And yeah, I love it.

492
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,273
I love it.

493
00:18:10,273 --> 00:18:11,106
Look at this.

494
00:18:11,106 --> 00:18:13,130
Like it's almost like a time capsule.

495
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:15,560
I'm going back to look at these pages

496
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,800
that I haven't looked at it over a year

497
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,070
and I can see that these two pages

498
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,260
obviously meant something to me.

499
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,730
There's something valuable on these pages.

500
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:27,980
And once I re-read it, it'll become very obvious why.

501
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,350
So ... That's it.

502
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,700
That's the tag, my friends.

503
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,930
I hope that was fun.

504
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:35,470
Let me know if there are any other tags you want me to do.

505
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:40,320
I kinda wanna do that anti haul tag question, video thing,

506
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,410
that's going around right now.

507
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:42,890
It seems really fun.

508
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:44,380
And I actually wanted to film that today.

509
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,010
And then once I was looking for the questions,

510
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:48,380
I was like "Maybe you don't know what you're saying."

511
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:51,500
So I decided not to film that today

512
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,830
but that is on my radar.

513
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,260
Let me know if there are any other tags

514
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,770
you want me to explore

515
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,130
because I had fun.

516
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:58,310
They're really quick and easy.

517
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:00,610
And I just feel like they're like a cute way to talk

518
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:04,168
about books without like talking about specific books.

519
00:19:04,168 --> 00:19:06,170
You know what I'm saying?

520
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:08,450
Anyway, that's it my friends.

521
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:09,470
I hope you liked this video.

522
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:10,490
I hope you had fun.

523
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:12,154
And I hope to see in the next one.

524
00:19:12,154 --> 00:19:13,136
Bye.

525
00:19:13,136 --> 00:19:16,469
(upbeat music playing)
