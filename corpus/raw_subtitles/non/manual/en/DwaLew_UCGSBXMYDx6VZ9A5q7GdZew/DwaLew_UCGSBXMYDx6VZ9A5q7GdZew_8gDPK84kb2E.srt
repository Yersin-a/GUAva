1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,579
I would meet people and they would be like yo, I'm this

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:12,689
and like ya know but like like like what

3
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:21,329
No, what are you and that's when I

4
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,460
Where am I wrong

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,689
What's up you guys it's your girl

6
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:40,739
today's video is gonna be a little bit different from you

7
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:46,919
I guess it's a little bit more serious today

8
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,689
Say like genetics DNA

9
00:00:53,379 --> 00:00:58,019
Heritage culture, etc. So, um

10
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,779
Let me gotta run down so

11
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:10,439
my principal was sick and I was will see her

12
00:01:11,229 --> 00:01:15,118
Was telling her somehow

13
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:19,110
We got on the topic of

14
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:24,689
And I was just telling her like I always

15
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:31,139
So fast forward a couple weeks later when she got

16
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,329
ah, and she was like I'm

17
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:42,179
She sent it to me and it ended up being a 23andme

18
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:45,000
so I got the package and

19
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:52,499
I just never open everyone in time. She send

20
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:58,529
Etc, etc. And after that that wasn't

21
00:02:01,149 --> 00:02:04,468
No, January, yeah, it was January

22
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:12,149
Almost here cuz it's it's November

23
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:17,140
I let it say say let it sit and

24
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,050
September I

25
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:24,789
Finally was like, okay. Let me

26
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:30,399
23 me and I'm also glad that I waited too because if

27
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:33,789
as possible that I wouldn't I

28
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,099
Wouldn't have God and

29
00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:46,629
You know our description of where I'm from because

30
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,470
so and about I

31
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,870
Registered my kid

32
00:02:57,349 --> 00:02:59,349
I'ma say well I

33
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:04,510
Feel like I'm kind of like over

34
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:11,260
Around September 16th, you know, I do all that nasty

35
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:20,259
And around that time I think you have to sender

36
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,190
I was like in September

37
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:26,350
I think that they were going to flood in so I'm

38
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:29,379
But every day and at all

39
00:03:31,549 --> 00:03:35,499
I'm just trying I'm like burning

40
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:42,999
My kid was registered. I'm looking at my email

41
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,730
and then

42
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:52,029
October 2nd, my reports were ready

43
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,600
2018 so October 2nd

44
00:03:56,209 --> 00:04:03,219
2018 my reports were ready and I've watched a ton of other

45
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:10,510
I arrived with a little time as y'all can

46
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:16,419
At least it was like Nene ready already. So let me get it a little

47
00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:24,549
Honestly, I've never had the culture or like whether for

48
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:32,919
Think that they care about stuff like that. I think I'm the only one

49
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,530
She's a little ignant. So I don't think if I

50
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,949
I don't think she no

51
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,940
being

52
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:47,889
African-american I was being black

53
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:52,689
You wanna say everybody my family or

54
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,620
Grew up here most

55
00:04:57,349 --> 00:05:02,739
grew up here most of the time in my

56
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:08,979
Very small portion of my life, but we moved it is

57
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:14,049
Family down there or nothing so I don't have

58
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:17,590
It's an upstate New York in this region.

59
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:24,340
And as for my father my father know much about where we came from.

60
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:29,649
you know had that conversation

61
00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:37,359
To me to be completely honest. I never really thought about

62
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:39,740
now

63
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,799
Like I said, I am from New York

64
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,150
But I'm not from New York City from those of you who are

65
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:48,080
so

66
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:54,609
When I went to college, it was just like a culture

67
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,130
PWI predominantly white

68
00:05:57,349 --> 00:06:03,489
institution but the percentage of black people

69
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:09,190
Good or whatever for the most part for

70
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:11,889
and

71
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,810
When I got there, you know

72
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:18,729
I was meeting people I left on campus and I

73
00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:21,999
I'm dis this and now what are

74
00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:29,109
and like ya know but like like like what

75
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,130
No, what are you?

76
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,770
And that's when I really

77
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,870
am I

78
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:44,130
Where am I firm because I would

79
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,170
Nigerian it would be from Ghana

80
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:52,289
I have a friend who's I think she's cubed a lot of

81
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:56,819
So it's just like and they are in those

82
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:00,569
My school are from New York

83
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:04,649
You know the five boroughs Browns

84
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:11,760
So down there, you know, it's very culture based and New

85
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:15,330
So once I got to college I

86
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:21,540
Like they got the only food and I think

87
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:27,659
And on this chicken a little chicky the loser cuz

88
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,250
Jack nothing else

89
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:37,320
I just always gonna have you thinking about it cuz my

90
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:40,620
Open up my mind to so

91
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,630
Yeah, ever since then. I've been wondering

92
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:49,049
so I'm really grateful that my

93
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,870
buy me this kit because

94
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,679
Lord knows I didn't even

95
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,500
party, and I never probably

96
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,859
would have found out about it

97
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,390
Yeah

98
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,479
so before prior to

99
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:12,869
I did look up a few videos and I noticed that they gave me

100
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:17,130
I'm probably and I was like, I'm

101
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:22,499
Five percent European because you know African

102
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:29,879
Um, you know, we always have a little bit of African in

103
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:37,439
Um, so yeah, my European percentage was not high at all. I did

104
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:45,719
We never had that culture talking my

105
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:56,699
Yes, so as far as what I thought I was because I got

106
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,360
From my school who were African

107
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:11,759
Most of the people that I'm at school are from there,

108
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,280
Nigeria and um

109
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:19,290
That's pretty much a dad

110
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,380
Just because of the

111
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,350
knowing that history

112
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:29,999
another thing people from my school is when I would just tell

113
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,900
400 years in history just

114
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:38,610
like they was like really an old that I

115
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,730
me I'm just like

116
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,020
Yeah

117
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:50,010
My bad job is

118
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:57,360
But like I was saying like they will forget that you know this whole

119
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,770
That are black

120
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:05,699
That don't know where they come from in Africa. I haven't message

121
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,129
I know that they like

122
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:12,900
And it just at that point it was kind of getting

123
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:21,150
You're in America. It's not like I'm living in Africa, you know then

124
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:25,619
Very familiar with what occurred here.

125
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:33,120
I'm pretty sure everybody in on the New York State area is

126
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,570
um

127
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,910
Yeah, that's another thing was a lot of

128
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:49,860
A lot of that and if anything in this video as a

129
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:57,579
I'm not trying to be offensive. I'm not trying to you

130
00:10:58,819 --> 00:11:04,238
So I got my results back and

131
00:11:07,369 --> 00:11:11,709
Chao was high so let's let's do it.

132
00:11:19,069 --> 00:11:21,728
Because I actually sent

133
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:29,948
Because I was just so excited. So your

134
00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:35,198
Ninety point four percent

135
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:47,228
I'm blacker than black black black black

136
00:11:49,789 --> 00:11:57,219
Okay, and guess what was Gus was my highest percentage

137
00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:01,089
Nigeria

138
00:12:01,249 --> 00:12:03,249
I

139
00:12:04,129 --> 00:12:10,178
Was thirty eight point nine, I

140
00:12:11,539 --> 00:12:13,539
0.9 percent

141
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:16,389
Nigerian, so I'm gonna

142
00:12:17,089 --> 00:12:18,859
after that, I say

143
00:12:18,859 --> 00:12:21,489
16.04 said coastal West African

144
00:12:22,549 --> 00:12:25,659
six point seven eight

145
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,279
percent

146
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:33,698
From the Congo Congolese. I'm not sure if I'm

147
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,879
You know, you know

148
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,339
say that a

149
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:42,069
Lot of these. I don't know

150
00:12:44,149 --> 00:12:46,779
Six point one per se. I know

151
00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:55,688
Southern East African one points one point four percent

152
00:12:57,079 --> 00:13:01,238
Sort of knees. They're a point

153
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:05,768
Was would you mean that's

154
00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:12,369
I was trying to be like cultural even though this is a low-key

155
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:16,390
I try to give y'all I try to give a little

156
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,870
It's green and

157
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:24,940
The yellow had to do because I don't have anything that's green

158
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,479
So yeah that mix up

159
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,360
1.6% broadly

160
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:37,599
Southern ease it just makes up a whole bunch of

161
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,860
so if i'm ninety

162
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:45,220
African how much my European

163
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,560
How much

164
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:54,099
Seven point eight percent

165
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,580
European

166
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:04,960
I'll take that and my highest percentage for being European

167
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,630
British and Irish

168
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,109
Scandinavian one point

169
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,880
0.9

170
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,880
Burley European one point for

171
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:20,710
This next one really shocked me

172
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:26,530
Growing up like oh, you're Native American.

173
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,080
Never got fed any of those lies

174
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:32,469
but according to this

175
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:37,899
East Asian and Native American. I am one

176
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:44,559
But I'm surprised that it existed.

177
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:47,410
one percent

178
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:51,039
that doesn't mean I don't

179
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:59,799
And I said drily north and northern

180
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,460
Burley Chinese and

181
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:10,299
So that makes up my 1.3 percent East Asian and

182
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,849
So yeah, I was extremely

183
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:18,040
Excited for you

184
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:22,119
But what I wanna do is

185
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:28,900
I kind of want to take the ancestry DNA one just

186
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,749
Accurate just because

187
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,350
I

188
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:39,190
Guess genetic pool to the tech exactly where

189
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,870
To me getting my reports

190
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:48,639
You know that did this with 23andme

191
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:56,499
Sub-saharan African that's it was like three categories

192
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,570
but I kind of want to

193
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:02,710
Do an ancestry DNA and I

194
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:06,939
but I only do it if you've got a really

195
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,550
seventy eighty dollars a

196
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,979
Irie go up large areas, or I know

197
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:20,500
but yeah, I was tight when I found

198
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,469
You know and I'm saying

199
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:26,230
back to school

200
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:09,529
Let me stop you copyrighted

201
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:16,999
Um, I was extremely inside I was in DC last week because it

202
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,949
And I hope any fellow Nigerians that happiness eaters.

203
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:30,318
I come from that country and that I

204
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:37,549
Because if I have to have kids I can tell them a little

205
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:45,260
Hmm I think that's gonna conclude this video, like I said,

206
00:17:45,779 --> 00:17:48,439
I'm black. I'm black.

207
00:17:49,409 --> 00:17:51,409
Nigerian air

208
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:58,939
Yeah, so that's pretty much it I'm sorry if I was

209
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,220

210
00:18:02,669 --> 00:18:06,589
