00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:04,410
hello everyone welcome back to my

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:07,440
channel so today I wanted to do a get

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:10,130
ready with me plus answering the growing

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,690
up Asian American tag so I'll just be

5
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:15,210
getting ready and answering each

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:18,150
question the first question is which

7
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:20,670
ethnicity are you and I am Tony's

8
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:25,019
American the second question is which

9
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:27,930
generation are you and my sister and I

10
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:29,730
were born here and my parents came from

11
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:32,880
Taiwan so I think that makes us

12
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:36,200
first-generation also I'm going to start

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,780
getting ready so I'm gonna put all of

14
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:42,570
the products that I'm using down in the

15
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,670
description below third question is what

16
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,260
is the first experience where you felt

17
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,379
that demarcation of being a minority

18
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:51,239
and/or different so the first time I

19
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:55,430
felt that was definitely and I think

20
00:00:51,239 --> 00:01:00,270
third or fourth grade I was at lunch and

21
00:00:55,430 --> 00:01:03,090
my mom had packed me basically like rice

22
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:05,869
with like veggies like different side

23
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:08,970
dishes that I could eat with my rice and

24
00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:12,590
I remember everyone else was eating like

25
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:15,659
a sandwich that their parents packed or

26
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:18,240
they bought lunch so like pizza chicken

27
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:20,310
tenders that sort of thing and I

28
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,530
remember thinking like being really

29
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:28,409
excited for my lunch first off because I

30
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:31,229
love like Asian food and basically I

31
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:33,869
opened my lunch up and then everyone was

32
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:36,360
like oh what is that smell like what

33
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:39,000
what are you eating and I definitely

34
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:42,450
felt very obviously judged for what I

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,049
was eating and it made me feel really

36
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:49,439
bad and the way people were talking

37
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:52,950
about my food and just kind of judging

38
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,049
what I was eating made me feel like oh I

39
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,750
don't really want to eat this anymore I

40
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:59,490
want to just eat whatever anyone else is

41
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,469
eating even though I would have been

42
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:05,280
happier eating what my mom packed but

43
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:08,970
for all the questions and comments that

44
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,630
I was getting I basically going forward

45
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,180
I just always bought lunch like

46
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:16,390
had pizza and chicken fingers and

47
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:19,600
hamburgers at school and it's sad

48
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:22,210
because I was much happier eating my

49
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:24,370
lunch that my mom packed but because of

50
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:26,110
what everyone was saying I decided that

51
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:27,880
I wanted to buy lunch the fourth

52
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:29,770
question is were you always proud of

53
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,450
your heritage or was there a time you

54
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:33,790
rejected it there was definitely a time

55
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:37,240
I rejected it and I would say it was

56
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:39,880
definitely at those like late elementary

57
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:43,510
school years all the way up to like high

58
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:45,640
school maybe and it was tough because I

59
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:48,330
knew I already physically looked

60
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,770
different and I didn't want people to

61
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:53,200
just point it out or notice that even

62
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:56,220
more whether that be through the food I

63
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:59,410
was eating the stuff I was wearing the

64
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:01,210
things I was saying and that's why I

65
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:04,060
hated when people asked me like where

66
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:07,540
are you from because that was so just an

67
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:09,940
obvious question that made people sure

68
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,620
that I was different but I remember when

69
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,850
I was young when people asked me like

70
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:16,810
where are your parents from I would

71
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:19,810
always say Taiwan and then no one knew

72
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:22,200
where Taiwan was at that time this was

73
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:25,810
probably like early elementary school

74
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:29,050
nobody knew and people would say oh

75
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:30,610
Thailand and I would say oh no Taiwan

76
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:32,260
and then no one would know where that

77
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:35,680
was so then I would just end up saying

78
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:37,810
oh my parents are from China so I said

79
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:42,370
that for quite a few years actually and

80
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:45,490
then later on when I went to university

81
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:47,350
that's when I started saying Taiwan

82
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:49,840
again and people actually started

83
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:52,600
knowing where Taiwan was which was quite

84
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,690
impressive and I think Taiwan over the

85
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:58,440
past 10 15 20 years has definitely up

86
00:03:55,690 --> 00:04:01,660
their tourism so that has definitely

87
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:03,610
helped it gain some more traction and

88
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:07,360
more people are just a little bit

89
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:09,130
familiar with the country this question

90
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,520
is what are some stereotypes that you

91
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:14,010
struggle with the very obvious one is

92
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,739
that as an

93
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:20,519
you're smart and you're expected to get

94
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:22,560
good grades and even though that is true

95
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,660
like our parents do expect us to get

96
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,870
good grades I think it gave me a lot of

97
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:29,669
pressure knowing that I had to be smart

98
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:32,790
I should have done better in class I

99
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:33,990
should have gotten a better score and it

100
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,910
also didn't help that people

101
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:38,370
automatically look at you and think oh

102
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:42,300
you're Asians are smart so you're a nod

103
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:45,199
so you're not cool and it made me kind

104
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:48,479
of wish that I wasn't smart I wish that

105
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,100
like I didn't have that stereotype and

106
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,199
people didn't think of me that way so I

107
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,570
remember when I was younger I would

108
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:58,320
always pretend that I didn't do as well

109
00:04:54,570 --> 00:05:01,560
in class or I wouldn't be as interested

110
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:04,410
in academics as I actually was just to

111
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:07,530
appear cool and to fit in but now I'm

112
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:08,820
super proud to be known as smart I think

113
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:11,250
that's a great thing and I think

114
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:13,620
especially when you're working and

115
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:15,960
people have this smart impression of you

116
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:18,570
that's so beneficial I want to continue

117
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:21,720
growing my intelligence growing my

118
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:24,840
smarts and really building my knowledge

119
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:27,030
because knowledge is priceless this

120
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,970
question is can you speak your language

121
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:33,389
and yes if you pay attention to my

122
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:34,979
YouTube you know that I do speak Chinese

123
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:37,320
and I've been creating some Chinese

124
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:40,410
videos on here but my Chinese is

125
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:43,380
definitely not good as far as Taiwanese

126
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:45,210
I can understand Taiwanese and I can

127
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:47,310
speak a little bit but it just sounds

128
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:48,900
really funky eat seven how has being

129
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:51,180
asian-american affected your

130
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:53,190
relationship with your parents so it's

131
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:55,410
definitely affected my relationship with

132
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:57,510
my parents I remember when I was younger

133
00:05:55,410 --> 00:06:00,000
I hated everything that they put me

134
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:04,580
through from extracurriculars like

135
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,410
learning to draw going to take piano and

136
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:09,360
just a ton of extracurriculars I

137
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:11,550
remember I hated it and I was like why

138
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,040
can't I just go home and do my homework

139
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:15,220
and

140
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:17,020
rest and then on Saturdays we have

141
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:20,050
Chinese school and that was even worse

142
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:22,630
because like all my friends only had to

143
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:24,340
go to school five days a week and I had

144
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:26,290
to go to school six days a week and

145
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:29,710
learn another language that I didn't

146
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:32,260
necessarily want to be learning so it

147
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:33,760
definitely created a lot of tension and

148
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:37,480
I remember fighting along with my

149
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:39,300
parents but I'm so grateful that they

150
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:42,700
put me through all these

151
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:45,190
extracurriculars and all these Chinese

152
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:47,200
classes and lessons because I'm so happy

153
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:49,800
I can speak the language at least

154
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:54,220
somewhat fluently and I'm so happy that

155
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:56,440
I don't know that I through doing all

156
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:59,230
those extra extracurriculars I was able

157
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:01,390
to build my own skill sets and really

158
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:05,370
understand what hard work is and

159
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:09,880
understand just like understand more of

160
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:12,160
hobbies cultures and what's out there

161
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:14,350
the eighth question is how do you feel

162
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,560
about your heritage now do you identify

163
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:20,530
with it and yes I'm so proud to be

164
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:22,840
Tony's American I definitely identify

165
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:28,060
with it I love everything about Taiwan

166
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:30,400
I love Tony's people whenever whenever I

167
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:32,770
see anyone who just came from Taiwan and

168
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,630
they introduce themselves and obviously

169
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:37,000
they're here in a different country I

170
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:39,700
try to really make an effort to let them

171
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,210
know hey like I'm Tony's - I'm Tony's

172
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:45,250
American I grew up here but I can speak

173
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:48,070
the language I understand Taiwan and I

174
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:51,040
want them to feel like they can come

175
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:52,960
fight and ask me anything and that I'm

176
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:55,660
here for them because we're all

177
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,340
Taiwanese last question is what is your

178
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:59,320
favorite thing about being Asian

179
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:01,030
Americans last year heritage so

180
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,340
Taiwanese American favorite thing about

181
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:05,680
being Tony's American is definitely

182
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:07,630
being able to see and understand both

183
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,630
world so the American and also the

184
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:13,170
Tony's Asian so that's a perspective

185
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:17,590
