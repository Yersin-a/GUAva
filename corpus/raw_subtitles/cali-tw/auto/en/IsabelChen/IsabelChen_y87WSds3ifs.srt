1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,299
hary one it's me Isabel it's been such a

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:08,189
long time my stomach just growled it's

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:09,990
been a really long time since I filmed

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:13,290
I'm so sorry it was my first year of

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,219
college finished and now I am back home

6
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,990
in Taiwan

7
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:19,380
I just wanted to film this video because

8
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,510
a few days ago or yesterday I was

9
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,029
watching Jenna's video of being

10
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:28,500
korean-american and this was a tag from

11
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:31,260
Amy her friend who was doing this in

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,510
terms of Asians Pacific American

13
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,550
Heritage Month and I was watching some

14
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,170
videos on BuzzFeed which they also had

15
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,450
other people talking about their

16
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:42,660
experiences being immigrants or also

17
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:44,070
like born in America but having to face

18
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,980
like some difficulties and also

19
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,989
successes being Asian so I thought I

20
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,690
would share some of my stories I am

21
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:52,800
really passionate about it overall

22
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:55,680
basically what Amy did was she put a

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,360
whole tag a few questions I just did her

24
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,699
questions that she provided and just

25
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,219
answered them back on my trusty dusty

26
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:04,170
laptop that further ado we'll just start

27
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:08,939
with it um new look

28
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:12,299
hello I hope you guys enjoy

29
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:16,109
so I'm Taiwanese American and I am a

30
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:20,250
second generation immigrant my parents

31
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:23,219
they left Taiwan to go to America and

32
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:29,429
they met and they fell in love and I was

33
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:32,149
born on July 22nd in San Diego and

34
00:01:29,429 --> 00:01:32,149
that's how I came to be

35
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:38,600
like we were in San Diego and then we

36
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:41,390
moved to Irvine and then we moved to San

37
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:43,219
Jose I would have Chinese school and I

38
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:45,950
would also have temple and these were

39
00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:49,039
things that were usually happening

40
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:50,450
during my weekends and it was just kind

41
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:52,099
of weird to connect with other people

42
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:53,560
and realize that they didn't have

43
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:56,179
Chinese school or they didn't have

44
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,469
temple to go to during the weekend that

45
00:01:56,179 --> 00:01:59,149
was when I kind of felt like I was

46
00:01:57,469 --> 00:02:00,979
different but I just didn't really know

47
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:03,200
why I was just like oh maybe that's just

48
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:05,090
my family likes to do this never really

49
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,280
had that much thought about it what

50
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:09,500
really made me realize how different I

51
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,560
was is when my family moved to Taiwan

52
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:15,290
because of my dad's job during that time

53
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:19,400
I was placed into an International

54
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:22,220
School in Taiwan I VSH I just started to

55
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,680
notice the difference of like Oh being

56
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:29,799
Asian our school was literally like a

57
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:33,290
whole grade was like 57 people and

58
00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:35,390
literally all of them were Asian there

59
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:39,230
were only probably a few that were not

60
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:42,260
even in that huge group of people that I

61
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:45,010
that were like the same ethnicity as me

62
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:48,530
I felt different I realized like my

63
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:50,090
experience in Taiwan would be so

64
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:51,950
different from my friends back in

65
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:54,169
America like their high school

66
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:56,810
experiences or like all the movies that

67
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:59,660
I would watch of like prom we did have

68
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:02,660
prom but it's like these experiences

69
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:06,590
were not going to be at like the same as

70
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:08,359
it would be if I was back in America and

71
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,400
that's when I started to realize the

72
00:03:08,359 --> 00:03:15,019
difference of it or like international

73
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:18,410
school it's where academia is largely

74
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:20,900
English based but you will also have

75
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:23,389
Chinese class you also have Chinese

76
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:25,790
social studies which that adds on to an

77
00:03:23,389 --> 00:03:26,299
extra two hours so when usually back in

78
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:29,480
America

79
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:33,319
I would end class at 247 i'd end class

80
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:36,230
here at 410 so that was always something

81
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:39,410
where - I dressed with and also like the

82
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:41,319
culture was not entirely similar to

83
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:45,840
being in America

84
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:45,840
and like having the education there

85
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:54,090
when I was back

86
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:57,870
in America I would be like super excited

87
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:59,700
of being um going to Taiwan because I

88
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,770
was like this is the place where I love

89
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:04,020
how crowded it I was always really happy

90
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:06,390
to go to Taiwan I would find my family

91
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:08,220
like my relatives and my grandma

92
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:10,260
she cooked amazing food there was only

93
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:12,810
once I went to back to Taiwan I actually

94
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:14,730
lived there like lived here permanently

95
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:18,120
for like eight years

96
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:20,220
um that's when I started to really like

97
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,229
reject my culture cuz I felt like

98
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,150
everything was so homogenized and there

99
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:25,740
was a really much diversity not saying

100
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:29,010
all Asians are the same someone says

101
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:31,110
that like but in terms of like our

102
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:32,540
background was pretty much similar in my

103
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,740
high school it was incredibly

104
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,180
competitive there would be days where I

105
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,160
felt like I was living in a bubble

106
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,500
because everyone was kind of striving

107
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,110
for the same things that it just started

108
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,820
to become really like pressuring over

109
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,830
all I really wanted to meet people that

110
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,450
were different from me like they had

111
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:50,370
different stories they had a different

112
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:52,740
background as opposed to something so

113
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:56,190
similar because I felt like that really

114
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:58,560
just made me focus on like a really

115
00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:01,710
narrow mindset as opposed to have like a

116
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:05,100
wider mindset I only started to really

117
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:07,410
like appreciate it was when I came back

118
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:10,169
from my first year know first semester

119
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:13,260
from college I go to college in New York

120
00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:16,830
so New York and Taiwan is literally like

121
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:20,340
halfway across the globe it's just so

122
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:22,560
far away there is still like some parts

123
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:25,500
of Taiwanese culture but it's pretty

124
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,450
miniscule compared to coming back here

125
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:30,780
really just allowed me to miss home and

126
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:32,970
realize like there are some experiences

127
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:35,160
that I have that no one is able to

128
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:38,940
really comprehend and really truly

129
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:41,130
understand I felt so grateful to have I

130
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:43,410
felt so grateful to be called the

131
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:45,720
international student because it really

132
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:49,440
allowed me to gain this like critical

133
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:53,039
view point the way of how I saw my life

134
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,789
back in Taiwan and my life during

135
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,789
college

136
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:04,350
okay so some stereotypes that I managed

137
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:06,720
to struggle with Asian they're smart

138
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:08,580
Asians are good at math there's so many

139
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,070
others that I could keep on talking

140
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:13,050
about but that would just take a really

141
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:14,820
long time for this pressure like that

142
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:17,190
was not really spoken but you could

143
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:18,509
still feel Asians should be doing

144
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:21,060
something that's more practical

145
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:23,400
something more science or like stem

146
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,449
based I was never really the person who

147
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,699
was good at that

148
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:28,979
I would always struggle on the subjects

149
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:30,780
that we were expected agents were

150
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:33,300
expected to be good at wanting to do

151
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:35,250
performing arts that just really made me

152
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,590
different a lot of people would really

153
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:39,210
judge comments of like oh are you sure

154
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:41,280
you really want to do performing arts

155
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:44,009
because it's not like something that's

156
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,770
biological I'm not born where I'm just

157
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:49,590
naturally good at math and science I get

158
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:51,470
so tired when people just say that it's

159
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:54,419
such like it's something that's so

160
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:57,050
natural it's not how much hard work is

161
00:06:54,419 --> 00:07:00,810
instilled in like the academic system in

162
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:02,789
Taiwan or like the kind of culture and

163
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:05,130
like ideals that your parents instill on

164
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:08,720
to you that's like the stereotype that I

165
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:08,720
really just struggled with

166
00:07:09,969 --> 00:07:14,589
growing up in this kind of Taiwanese

167
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:18,279
culture they essentially instilled what

168
00:07:14,589 --> 00:07:22,809
they were taught from their parents to

169
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:24,789
put on to like me and my brother they

170
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:27,069
had more of a traditional mindset when

171
00:07:24,789 --> 00:07:29,949
it came to gender norms for example for

172
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:31,899
being a female I was expected to be prim

173
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:36,669
and proper not to be too loud like not

174
00:07:31,899 --> 00:07:38,619
focusing is it focusing okay yeah often

175
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:42,610
it's like what's expected of a son and

176
00:07:38,619 --> 00:07:44,919
what's expected of a daughter and yeah

177
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:47,589
like the things that they have been

178
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:49,569
taught at a young age differs from like

179
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:51,459
the things that I've been taught in

180
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:53,110
college I've taken like classes and

181
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:55,419
woman and Gender Studies classes like

182
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:57,929
those really challenged like the social

183
00:07:55,419 --> 00:08:00,249
norms and like gender norms like

184
00:07:57,929 --> 00:08:02,979
expectations that are given that was

185
00:08:00,249 --> 00:08:04,749
like a huge eye-opener for things that

186
00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:07,929
I've always questioned but was never

187
00:08:04,749 --> 00:08:12,309
really able to put a firm like stance or

188
00:08:07,929 --> 00:08:13,839
belief in a lot of my views that often

189
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:16,979
or sometimes come in clash with my

190
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:19,029
parents are because I take the

191
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:22,599
indoctrinations that they bring to me

192
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:24,669
and I also take like my outside college

193
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:26,559
experience analyzing what are the

194
00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:29,699
stances that I believe like what are the

195
00:08:26,559 --> 00:08:33,129
values that I hold true I feel like in

196
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:35,259
Western like culture they emphasize on

197
00:08:33,129 --> 00:08:37,180
individualism it's that certain sense of

198
00:08:35,259 --> 00:08:39,250
like finding your own self and that

199
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:41,019
you're the one who's able to create your

200
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:43,709
own destiny don't know if that really is

201
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:48,240
truly related but like it's somewhat

202
00:08:43,709 --> 00:08:48,240
correlated yeah

203
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:58,560
yes I am extremely proud to be telling

204
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:01,110
these American I think both cultures

205
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,990
Taiwanese and being American like these

206
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:06,270
really shaped the person that I am

207
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:08,240
there's this way where I can compare and

208
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:11,040
contrast and even like fuse together

209
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,110
differing viewpoints I remember I was

210
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,240
talking to my dad came back from my

211
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:16,800
first semester of college realizing that

212
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,650
being Toni's is something that I'm

213
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,270
really proud of and he said like yeah

214
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:24,030
the thing is that you'll always be

215
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:26,520
Taiwanese not American like that's for

216
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:29,400
sure I stopped him and I said the thing

217
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:32,220
is that I don't believe that American

218
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:35,160
means only one thing like being American

219
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:38,130
is being white instead being American is

220
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:42,600
being Korean American being Japanese

221
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:44,520
American his Latin ex American African

222
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,560
American and even immigrants make up

223
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:49,500
what is American that's my definition

224
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,660
yes you can be both you can be Taiwanese

225
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:54,180
you can be American there should be this

226
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:57,540
part where American capsule eights

227
00:09:54,180 --> 00:10:00,620
Taiwanese or like Korean just people who

228
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:03,600
come to the States and just want to be

229
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:06,750
here I really identify with it it's kind

230
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,060
of like gratitude that you have because

231
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:11,370
there's so much more to you your

232
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:14,310
ethnicity is important but it's not

233
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:17,570
something that solely defines you our

234
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:17,570
last question

235
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:23,750
my favorite thing about being

236
00:10:20,779 --> 00:10:26,510
asian-american is bringing forth a

237
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:30,140
different perspective when I'm in the

238
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:32,990
States or when I'm even in Taiwan darío

239
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:36,020
types are still so prevalent in our

240
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:38,270
society I can't like tell you how many

241
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:40,130
times I've like had so many

242
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,990
microaggressions that were directed at

243
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:43,610
me or like stereotypes that people would

244
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:46,790
use are you kidding me

245
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:48,560
I think being a Taiwanese American

246
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:51,830
really just allows me to be like this

247
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,779
advocate against the stereotype there

248
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:55,790
wouldn't be this kind of X like belief

249
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:57,740
that oh I would just breathe in and take

250
00:10:55,790 --> 00:11:00,170
it I want people to understand that

251
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:02,990
stereotypes are not the way to allow

252
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:05,060
people to get together instead it just

253
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:08,080
divides other people it really makes me

254
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:10,610
uncomfortable when people just reduce my

255
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,470
personality or Who I am as a person to

256
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:14,420
just something so simple and something

257
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:16,700
so offensive

258
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:19,070
I think being Taiwanese American really

259
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:21,620
allows me to just understand that

260
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:23,390
there's still so much to that needs to

261
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:25,970
be done in terms of bringing more

262
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:28,190
representation when it comes to like TV

263
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:31,520
shows or movies because there are so

264
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:33,830
many stereotypes that like you can see

265
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:35,839
in film the great wall for example and

266
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:37,820
assume that white people are the ones

267
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,620
that are saving China you would never

268
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:42,260
really understand or realize that

269
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:44,870
there's a certain kind of dignity

270
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:48,410
something that's more magnificent and

271
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:52,700
the actual true story of something then

272
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:55,490
an outsider's viewpoint of a country

273
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,690
that's alien that's really just my

274
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,500
favorite thing about being an

275
00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:00,050
asian-american
