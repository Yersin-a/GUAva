1
00:00:00,183 --> 00:00:03,350
(mellow guitar music)

2
00:00:05,725 --> 00:00:08,100
- Hey, everyone, it's your girl Jenn

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,760
and I am so excited to film this video for you guys

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,530
because the month of May is Asian Pacific Heritage Month

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,610
and in the spirit of that, I thought that it would be

6
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,490
very timely to do the Asian American tag.

7
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,130
I wanted to share with you guys my experience

8
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,500
growing up Asian American and my friend Amy gave

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,710
this whole concept structure and made it very simple

10
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,400
by creating questions and so I just wanna

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,670
dive right into it so let's get started.

12
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,070
I am Korean-American.

13
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,510
I was born and raised in Southern California.

14
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,460
So my parents immigrated from Korea

15
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,540
and they first moved to Chile

16
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,940
and that's where my mom had my brother

17
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,200
but after my parents got their green card,

18
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,690
they were able to come to America and they had me.

19
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:52,820
And so I would categorize me and my brother

20
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,840
as first-generation because like, my parents didn't speak

21
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,370
any English so we were truly the first generation

22
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,561
to really grow up American here.

23
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:04,040
The first experience when I realized that I was different

24
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,070
from the rest of the kids, was when I was

25
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:11,340
in first or second grade, my mom packed my favorite food

26
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,450
which was kare rice which is basically just curry

27
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,370
with rice and it has vegetables and meat

28
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,530
and it's so delicious and I remember

29
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,150
being so excited to eat it for lunchtime

30
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,740
and when I opened the Tupperware, I remember a kid

31
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,690
looking at it and just being so disgusted

32
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:27,727
and he just called me out, he was like,

33
00:01:27,727 --> 00:01:29,670
"Jennifer packed poop for lunch!"

34
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,760
and I remember being so mortified and so embarrassed

35
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,010
and I just completely lost my appetite

36
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,240
and I don't, I didn't even eat that lunch

37
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,860
and when I got home, I told my Mom that I never wanted her

38
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,930
to pack things like this again.

39
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,770
I told her that I only wanted her to pack like Lunchables

40
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,890
and sandwiches just like normal American food

41
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:48,930
so that I would fit in.

42
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,430
When I was younger, there was a period where

43
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,922
I was super proud to be Korean.

44
00:01:51,922 --> 00:01:56,000
It happened when I was around like nine years old.

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,230
My mom took me and my brother to Korea

46
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,160
for the entire summer, and we stayed at my aunt's

47
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,430
and it was such an amazing experience because for once

48
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,500
like I realized like that everyone looked like me

49
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,417
and I felt really, just like, I just felt like I connected

50
00:02:08,417 --> 00:02:11,690
with everybody and I remember always hanging out

51
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,020
at this park where all the kids used to hang out

52
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,510
and I made a lot of friends because everyone was so

53
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,550
fascinated at the fact that I was American.

54
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:22,230
And so I would bring like chapter books that I'd packed

55
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,777
and I'd be like (speaks in foreign language),

56
00:02:25,731 --> 00:02:28,310
and everyone was like so impressed and it was just,

57
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,910
it was just a really great time for me

58
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,930
and that's when I was really just like proud of my culture

59
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:37,740
and when I brought that back to America, like that,

60
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,070
that pride stayed there for a little bit

61
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:43,930
until I went to middle school and middle school was

62
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,750
when everything just kind of changed for me.

63
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,790
I feel like it was a lot of factors just hitting

64
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,210
all when I was like 11.

65
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:53,620
It was puberty, it was the fact that I was like chubby

66
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,480
and then the fact that like there weren't that many

67
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,270
Asians in my school.

68
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,750
I remember there was a group of these boys

69
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,210
that walked the same route as me home

70
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:05,600
and I remember hating when we would like cross paths

71
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,330
because they would always say something to me

72
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,310
and they would say something so like racist.

73
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,590
They would say things like "Hey chink do you wanna

74
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,423
do my homework?"

75
00:03:13,423 --> 00:03:16,939
or "Hey, you dropped your calculator" and now,

76
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:21,090
I wish that I had the strength to just clap back at them

77
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,400
because at the time, I just didn't say anything,

78
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,233
I was so scared

79
00:03:24,233 --> 00:03:26,810
I was, I was genuinely afraid of my, for, I was afraid

80
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:30,630
for my life and I wish that I had the courage

81
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,407
to just like stand up to them and be like

82
00:03:32,407 --> 00:03:35,197
"Hey yes, I did drop my calculator, thank you.

83
00:03:35,197 --> 00:03:37,272
"I'm really, really gonna need this when I'm just

84
00:03:37,272 --> 00:03:40,580
"calculating all my finances in the future"

85
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:43,400
but unfortunately, I wasn't like that.

86
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,580
I think this also crossed at the same path

87
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:49,024
when my parents made me go to Korean school on Saturday

88
00:03:49,024 --> 00:03:52,810
and I was so pissed that they were making me and my brother

89
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,730
go to school an extra day.

90
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,710
Like we already had Monday through Friday

91
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:59,360
and now they're adding like a whole new curriculum

92
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,660
for Saturday and like we also, they also made us go

93
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,670
to church every Sunday so I felt like I had

94
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,440
no days off, like ugh!

95
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,200
So we had to go to Korean school and there was this

96
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,120
one instance with a teacher that just really stuck with me.

97
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,520
She was telling us that when people ask us what our

98
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,210
ethnicity is, we need to say that we are Korean-American.

99
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:25,010
The Korean always has to be first and I remember being very

100
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:28,470
unsettled by it because I felt like in my heart that

101
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:31,290
I was American so I rose my hand and I told her my piece

102
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:34,867
and she said, "No, you are always going to be Korean.

103
00:04:34,867 --> 00:04:37,160
"You're Korean-American."

104
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,317
And I just said like, "Why can't I just be American?

105
00:04:41,317 --> 00:04:44,850
"I was born here, I speak the language, I don't understand."

106
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:47,890
I just felt like this big distance between my culture

107
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,960
and what I was brought into.

108
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,880
I associated being Korean as a negative thing because

109
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,770
number one, the bullying sucked and number two, I would

110
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,430
see the way people would treat my parents.

111
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,950
Like my parents didn't speak English very well.

112
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,190
I would just see the way people would treat my parents

113
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,430
because of their accent.

114
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,110
People lose their temper, people get frustrated,

115
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,880
people treat you like you're an idiot when you have

116
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,880
an accent and it just really frustrated me and my Mom

117
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:19,750
is already kind of a shy, timid person and I think

118
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,193
when she was thrown into this world in America

119
00:05:22,193 --> 00:05:26,010
as like a foreign person, I think that

120
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,540
just made her reclusive even more.

121
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,000
One stereotype that I absolutely struggled with growing up

122
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,430
was the model minority stereotype.

123
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:35,256
The fact that all Asians are amazing at crunching numbers

124
00:05:35,256 --> 00:05:37,930
and they're just really great academically blah, blah, blah

125
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,290
and I think from an outsider's perspective

126
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:42,750
people might think wow like, that's actually a really

127
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,815
good stereotype, like people just think you're really smart

128
00:05:44,815 --> 00:05:48,520
but it puts a lot of pressure on you especially

129
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,810
when you are not academically smart.

130
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:54,760
Like I, growing up I tried my best to be a good student.

131
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,100
Like I would literally spend hours and hours doing

132
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,150
my homework and all this stuff and it just

133
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,320
wouldn't register to me.

134
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,290
Like I was always like a B minus, C student, like one time

135
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:09,530
I got a D and like, in an Asian household like that

136
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:13,150
is unacceptable, like my B minuses were such disappointments

137
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,570
to my parents and they would always compare me to like

138
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:18,310
other kids and because I wasn't the best student, I felt

139
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:21,850
this distance between my Asian American peers that were

140
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:25,960
very studious so I just found like a new group of friends.

141
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,380
Like friends that I can connect with artistically

142
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,790
and creatively and obviously like there was

143
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,180
Asian Americans there too but it was like a whole mix

144
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,300
and it was really cool like we would,

145
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,890
you know burn CDs for each other, we would go to shows,

146
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:41,560
we'd go thrifting and I felt really blessed that I was able

147
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,410
to have my own community in high school.

148
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:44,910
Yes I can speak Korean.

149
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:47,770
I would probably say I speak the equivalent of like

150
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:50,258
a seven year old, maybe a six year old now.

151
00:06:50,258 --> 00:06:52,750
Like I know how to get by.

152
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,310
I know, you know, how to ask for directions, order food,

153
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,850
have like light conversation but anything with depth,

154
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,900
I'm just like ugh like, I don't know.

155
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,140
When I watch the Korean news, I'm just kinda like,

156
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,000
I don't know what they're saying.

157
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,570
They have to talk a lot slower.

158
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,440
It was a lot better when I was living with my parents

159
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,960
obviously, like I speak Conglish with my parents

160
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,610
so I'll speak Korean and then I'll just fill

161
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:16,310
in English words where I don't know the Korean words.

162
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,190
I just don't understand like where did all those years

163
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:21,020
of Korean school go, like, did I just bury them in a box?

164
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,550
Like it's, I don't know but I want

165
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,642
to change this desperately and so I'm just gonna do

166
00:07:25,642 --> 00:07:27,350
like an open call now.

167
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,981
I'm looking for a Korean tutor if you are based

168
00:07:29,981 --> 00:07:32,420
in the Los Angeles area, I would love for you

169
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:35,160
to DM me on my Instagram, it's IMJENNIM.

170
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,226
I guess you just tell me your name, your age,

171
00:07:38,226 --> 00:07:41,500
what school you go to or if you did and just like

172
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,390
what kind of program would you put me on for, ya know,

173
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,237
my Korean tutoring session.

174
00:07:46,237 --> 00:07:49,600
Being Korean-American absolutely affected my relationship

175
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,560
with my parents.

176
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,140
There was a lot of frustration and anger because

177
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,940
of all the miscommunication that would happen.

178
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,410
There were so many times where I would just try

179
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,820
to talk to my parents but there are just words

180
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:05,800
that I just didn't know and vice versa and we would

181
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,000
just have yelling matches.

182
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,167
I would scream at them being like,

183
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:10,180
"Why can't you (bleep) learn English"

184
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,217
and they would just say like, "Why don't you know Korean,

185
00:08:12,217 --> 00:08:13,490
"like you are Korean."

186
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:17,240
And so it always felt like this battle and growing up

187
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,270
my entire life, I felt this huge disconnect

188
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:24,450
from my brain and my mouth, like I felt like I couldn't

189
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:27,310
say exactly what I was feeling or I couldn't articulate

190
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:30,210
and put into words so writing was a nightmare for me.

191
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,140
I hated writing because I would just look at the paper

192
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,290
and be like, "I just don't know what to say."

193
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:37,410
I don't know, like maybe was it because I was juggling

194
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:38,920
two languages, like I don't know.

195
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,920
I mean, but I just look at other people and I see like

196
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,970
you grew up with like four languages and you're fine

197
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,770
so I don't know, maybe it's just like a personal thing

198
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:47,110
but I've always had trouble communicating and so

199
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,570
with my parents with that language barrier, it was just

200
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,470
like an extra level of just ugh, just fogginess

201
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,840
and I just, I was just very angry growing up

202
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,740
and I feel really bad for my parents because

203
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,410
when I was a teenager, I was not, I mean I was

204
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:04,270
kind of a nightmare so now I wanna chat

205
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,680
about the power dynamics because I feel like

206
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,150
that was kind of off with my parents because when we were

207
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,660
at home, obviously my parents were in charge so we'd listen

208
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:15,970
to them but when we were out and about, we would always

209
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:18,896
be translating and speaking, especially for my Mom

210
00:09:18,896 --> 00:09:23,274
and it's because my Mom is a very shy and fearful person

211
00:09:23,274 --> 00:09:27,162
and I don't know if she was always this way because I

212
00:09:27,162 --> 00:09:30,700
didn't know her when she was younger but I think it's

213
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:35,330
because of the judgment that people would give because

214
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:36,560
something really traumatic happened

215
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,780
to her while she was out here so

216
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,643
So when I was in preschool,

217
00:09:43,643 --> 00:09:46,520
I remembered my Dad picked me

218
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,390
up from school and I knew something was wrong

219
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,170
because normally my Mom picks me up from school so we

220
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:58,170
go home and I go to my parents' room and I see my Mom

221
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:01,330
just lying on the bed with a towel on her face

222
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:04,670
and so I asked my Dad like, "Is everything okay?"

223
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,727
and he says, "Oh she's just napping."

224
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:12,170
We found out later that someone had robbed the store.

225
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,570
My parents had a really small shop that sold

226
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:19,570
women's clothes in El Monte and someone had a knife

227
00:10:19,623 --> 00:10:22,720
and he told her to give her the money in the register

228
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,370
and my Mom refused because that was all the money

229
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:31,440
we had and so she said no

230
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,550
and he sliced her face and of course he took the money

231
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,650
and she was a very fearful, fearful person after that.

232
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:46,650
She never spoke and I think it took her a very long time

233
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:50,000
to recover from that and when she told me that story

234
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
again when I was older, it just, it just lit a fire

235
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:59,890
in me, like I, because I

236
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:03,550
never want my parents to be in a situation like

237
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,540
that ever again and the reason why

238
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,990
I'm telling you this story is because I feel like

239
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:14,090
first-generation parents, they have to do the shitty jobs.

240
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,930
They have to work in the dangerous locations.

241
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:20,210
The have to work at the salon, the convenience stores

242
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,330
and they do this because they want to give us a better life

243
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:29,330
and so it makes me want to try so hard and to be able

244
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,710
to provide for them and so that they never have

245
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:33,520
to worry about that again.

246
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,153
Every day I'm so grateful that they chose to move here

247
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:38,950
to give me and my brother a better life, to give all

248
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:42,760
of us a better life and whenever I'm feeling unmotivated

249
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:47,057
or I feel like I just can't do it, I think of that

250
00:11:47,057 --> 00:11:50,050
and it just snaps me right back up

251
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:53,302
and it just fuels me to push harder.

252
00:11:53,302 --> 00:11:57,460
I feel so proud to be Korean-American now

253
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,310
and it definitely took some time.

254
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:02,280
I think it's because the older I got, the more I just

255
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,770
had to accept myself and I started to embrace my heritage

256
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:08,720
when I was probably like a senior in high school

257
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,730
to a freshman in college.

258
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,200
I think that's when I realized I can't change who I am

259
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,890
so I have to accept it and I really hope that people don't

260
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:22,750
judge me for wanting to distance myself from my culture

261
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:26,560
because I think it all came from a place of me just

262
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,293
really wanting to fit in and really wanting

263
00:12:29,293 --> 00:12:31,440
for people to like me.

264
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,410
I'm here now and I'm so freaking proud to be Korean-American

265
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,250
and I want to specify that I'm both.

266
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:40,920
In America generally people just see me as an Asian

267
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,270
and when I go back to Korea or when people

268
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:45,180
or Asian Americans go back to their motherland,

269
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,440
people categorize us as Americans so we

270
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,440
don't fully belong in either.

271
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,580
We're in our own category and I'm not mad about that.

272
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:58,400
I love the fact that I can have the best of both worlds.

273
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,650
It's like the Hannah Montana song.

274
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:02,820
My favorite thing about being Korean-American is the

275
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,670
resilience because I feel like Korea has gone through

276
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:09,870
so much from Imperialism to war and now the fact that we

277
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:13,410
are one of the major players in the economy just fills me

278
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:16,380
with so much pride, like we are killing it in the cars,

279
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:20,572
the technology, the cosmetics, entertainment, K-Pop is

280
00:13:20,572 --> 00:13:23,030
frickin' nuts and K dramas.

281
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,420
So the fact that we were able to build from nothing

282
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,960
in such a short amount of time makes me so proud.

283
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,310
Like I'm just always cheering on the underdog

284
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,540
no matter where you're from, where your background is,

285
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,550
I just love when people realize that

286
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,350
it's never too late to evolve.

287
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,770
All right guys those were all the answers to my tag.

288
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:42,000
I would love for you guys to be able to fill out the

289
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,140
questions down below whether you wanna do it

290
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,230
in a comment or even your own video.

291
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,450
I wanna know what it was like growing up,

292
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:49,770
whatever ethnicity you were.

293
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:53,100
Just replace the Korean or Asian to whatever your heritage

294
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,030
is and I would love for you to share your experiences.

295
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:59,300
It's like we live in this globalized world where we can

296
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,120
share our stories, we can explain what happened so that

297
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,106
way we can learn from it.

298
00:14:04,106 --> 00:14:07,920
I wanna thank you guys for finishing this video

299
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,920
and listening to me because it really, really means a lot.

300
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:16,408
So thank you for watching, bye.

301
00:14:16,408 --> 00:14:19,575
(mellow guitar music)
