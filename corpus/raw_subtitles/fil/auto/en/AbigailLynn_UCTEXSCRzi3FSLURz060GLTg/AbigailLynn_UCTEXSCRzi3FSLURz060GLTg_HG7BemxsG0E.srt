00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,360
hello everyone

3
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,680
and welcome back to the inner thoughts

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,600
podcast this is your host abigail

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,720
and today's episode is another solo

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,960
episode

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,119
and i wanted to talk about something

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,240
that might be a little bit controversial

9
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,599
for those who don't really

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:33,360
know me beyond surface level because

11
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:36,239
this inspirational kind of subject came

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,559
from i have to give a little backstory

13
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,120
so

14
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,719
basically i did not go to church on this

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,040
particular saturday because i had worked

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,280
the night before and i was really tired

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,280
but unfortunately i missed a really good

18
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,239
afternoon program in which

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,000
they kind of sought like inspiration

20
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,199
from one of those jubilee videos if

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,960
you've ever seen

22
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,559
it's like they get a group of people and

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,239
then they ask them a certain question

24
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,559
and then they have to line up on a

25
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:03,600
certain line which is like agree

26
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:05,439
somewhat agree neutral

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,600
disagree somewhat disagree something

28
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:08,240
like that right and so they did it with

29
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,479
some youth

30
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,680
in our church and they asked them a

31
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,360
couple questions

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,119
and they only asked them four because

33
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,520
there was like a ton of them

34
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,240
and they had to like expound their

35
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,920
thoughts

36
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,680
so i think there was actually originally

37
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,600
supposed to be ten questions so

38
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,280
i only have the four that they asked at

39
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,159
that time and i'm going to answer it

40
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,159
myself

41
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,720
but if they do a part two which is most

42
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:33,439
likely going to happen i will definitely

43
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,880
like do a part two of like this episode

44
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,400
because i think like these topics are

45
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,720
very interesting to talk about

46
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,439
so let's get started i know it's gonna

47
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,079
be quite

48
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,560
short but i think it'll be okay i'll try

49
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:47,040
my best to expound as much as i can to

50
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,000
fill up the 30 minute mark of a podcast

51
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,600
but at the same time

52
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,920
of course if it's like short then it's

53
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,399
okay too so let's get started

54
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,360
so the first one is i like christian

55
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,520
music

56
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,280
so i don't know where to stand on this

57
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,960
one because i think

58
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,600
when you ask that kind of question like

59
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,680
christian music that is a very broad

60
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,080
you know kind of genre you can even say

61
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,479
religious music is a broad genre because

62
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,599
you can have like traditional hymns you

63
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,959
can have christian pop

64
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,920
rock you can have gospel you can have

65
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,560
worship

66
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,080
so i guess i can go into how i feel

67
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,400
personally about those

68
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,599
four categories that i just said within

69
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,520
christian music

70
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,040
so let's start with hymns which is

71
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,360
something i'm more

72
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,239
of used to i guess because i grew up

73
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,120
with that and i

74
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,280
am okay with it you know i like hymns i

75
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,599
like playing them every now and then

76
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,200
when i don't have anxiety on the piano

77
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,480
but do i go out of my way to listen to

78
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,120
it i do not

79
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,800
only like on sabbath of course when i'm

80
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,480
at church and you know doing things

81
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,280
there then i will listen to it like

82
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,959
obviously

83
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,200
but i don't go out of my way like during

84
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,200
the week to do like listen to it

85
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,400
which honestly is kind of like a guilt

86
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,360
thing but

87
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,120
you know i just don't you know it's just

88
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,200
a thing that i don't gravitate

89
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,599
fully towards you know and it's kind of

90
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,200
sad because usually like

91
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,879
you should be listening to you know that

92
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,800
kind of music like it not

93
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,319
should just not be on the sabbath you

94
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,840
know you should you know if you want to

95
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,440
listen throughout the weekend

96
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,040
throughout the week but personally for

97
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,640
me i don't gravitate towards

98
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,800
you know going out of my way to listen

99
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,959
to it but i have no problem with it i

100
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,080
like it that's what i'm used to

101
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:27,920
and now we go into worship music

102
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,599
and so i am like generally okay with it

103
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,040
and i guess you could like say

104
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,920
worship and pop rock christian are kind

105
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,159
of together

106
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,360
i'm generally okay with it although it's

107
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,040
kind of awkward

108
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,040
because i noticed that when i used to go

109
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,519
to university you know

110
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,879
back in america in a private university

111
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,360
and they would sing these kinds of songs

112
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,480
and

113
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,040
i don't know these songs and it's like

114
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,959
they kind of assume that people do or

115
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,200
they kind of introduce it and it's like

116
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,239
they're singing it gets really awkward

117
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,840
because they're singing

118
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,280
like their ad-libs or whatever so you

119
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,360
don't really know what the real

120
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,680
tune is of the song so it's like kind of

121
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,239
awkward but nevertheless i like it you

122
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,760
know

123
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,519
i like the ambiance of it um sometimes

124
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,439
more than traditional hymns like i have

125
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,799
no problem with it although

126
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,480
and this might get me in trouble with

127
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,360
some friends that are into that kind of

128
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,239
genre music

129
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,759
i don't like the drums thing because

130
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,919
it's a little bit too

131
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,440
loud and something i'm just not

132
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,440
particularly used to because it sounds

133
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,360
like a rock concert in a sense

134
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,720
and i know that's such like a

135
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,440
traditional

136
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,960
christian kind of viewpoint but that's

137
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,880
just personally me

138
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,400
i have no problem with the genre it's

139
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,160
just like sometimes the drums is a

140
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,360
little bit too much that i'm like

141
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,000
ah this is kind of odd but you know it's

142
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,560
something i'm getting

143
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,400
used to because more recently within the

144
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,320
past one or two years

145
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,800
our youth have actually started singing

146
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,240
these songs more in the worship services

147
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,240
if you guys have seen my vlogs like

148
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,880
usually i would vlog like every saturday

149
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,880
and you can see

150
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,960
like they're actually doing it and i'm

151
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,720
okay with it but i know that some church

152
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,440
members are still not okay with it

153
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,360
because

154
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,520
it's either like a message or the song

155
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,080
or just the progression of it

156
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,240
sounding like you know not what they're

157
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,120
traditionally used to which is hymns

158
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,039
but in my thinking i guess i didn't

159
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,880
really answer the hymns part

160
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:22,000
i when i say i like hymns i would say

161
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:25,120
like strongly agree i guess

162
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,080
and then pop rock worship christian

163
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,840
music

164
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:32,479
i would be like i guess neutral

165
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,440
to like somewhat agree like in that

166
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,960
little bit of there

167
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,199
it's just like certain aspects like the

168
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,320
drums or just you know the message of

169
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,520
the song maybe not

170
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:44,000
sounding so near and

171
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,280
dear to the heart of god rather than you

172
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,800
know something else

173
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,720
like the message can be conveyed as

174
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,320
something else i guess and then the

175
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,400
drums thing which i said like it's

176
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,560
something i'm still getting used to

177
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,000
um i don't necessarily agree with it but

178
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,479
that's just personal taste

179
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,639
so there's that and i guess you could

180
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,120
say the last one which is gospel music

181
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,840
now we don't really have those i have

182
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,319
been to churches where that's like the

183
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,400
predominant

184
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,759
you know type of music that they sing i

185
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,680
have no problem with it

186
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,199
i you know like the ambience of it

187
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,840
because everyone's singing and things

188
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,840
like that

189
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,000
although i will say and i can say this

190
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,039
for christian pop rock and sometimes

191
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,600
worship music

192
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:23,360
sometimes the interlude is so long that

193
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,120
like song service is like

194
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,400
15 minutes long and you know what i

195
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,479
shouldn't like

196
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,840
feel like this because you know we're

197
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,759
praising god things like that but

198
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,400
sometimes it's so long that i'm like

199
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,880
kind of okay like let's just go we're

200
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,240
just

201
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,919
waiting for the sermon kind of thing

202
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,639
like let's keep moving

203
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,520
so that's my only thing but otherwise

204
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,000
like i think

205
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,840
like gospel music is so beautiful i love

206
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,639
the harmonies i love the praise

207
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,160
like aspect of it like yes like work

208
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,080
like it's so

209
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,520
like you just feel so good after

210
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,520
listening to it and everyone's like

211
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,639
kind of like you know it's like a

212
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,039
community like

213
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,800
kind of singing and rejoicing together

214
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:04,319
it's just so beautiful so

215
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:07,120
i guess for gospel music

216
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,240
i'll put somewhat agree so you can say

217
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,280
in the genre of

218
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,280
christian music if i like it or not i'll

219
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,520
take the medium answer and it's

220
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,800
somewhat agreed that i like it so

221
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,639
there's that

222
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,560
i hope that was not too long i think it

223
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,199
was because it's already seven minutes

224
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,759
all right second question my parents are

225
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,360
always

226
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:30,080
right obviously this is a

227
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,240
hard disagree because we're all humans

228
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,520
we make mistakes you know

229
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,520
and one of the kids actually said like

230
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,880
they disagree because you know sometimes

231
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,199
their parents say things and they're not

232
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,560
true

233
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,000
like hey go get my wallet it's like

234
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,520
on the dining room table but it's

235
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,039
actually not it's in your purse in the

236
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,639
car where you are you just didn't bother

237
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,680
to look so obviously you're not always

238
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,840
right it's like

239
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,919
things like that and it's so true

240
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,360
because like usually when you think

241
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,960
if my parents are always right you're

242
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,560
thinking of like kind of like an

243
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,479
abstract kind of view right

244
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,840
like they're telling you this and that

245
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,199
and you're thinking oh yeah they are

246
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,639
always right when they tell me what to

247
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,879
do or some things but

248
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,319
the thing is with parents and i guess

249
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,240
like humans in general we're always

250
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,680
learning every day right we always make

251
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,840
mistakes every day

252
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:18,240
so it's not always right

253
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,440
like they're not always gonna be right

254
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,720
and that's

255
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,520
life that's how things are um obviously

256
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,400
your parents

257
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,520
or my parents i will say are right in

258
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,199
some degree

259
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,120
with like you know their life decisions

260
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,560
or the advice they can give me and the

261
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,479
knowledge that they know but it's not

262
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,399
always always right like i feel like

263
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,399
always when you say always it's

264
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,519
a very big superlative and that's

265
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,599
definitely not true

266
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,120
so i will definitely say that it's a

267
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,720
hard disagree that they are not always

268
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,399
right because like i said

269
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,320
usually when i think of that question i

270
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,920
think like if i have to like do

271
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,839
something for my parents

272
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,000
and they're telling me to do a certain

273
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,760
thing like for example like

274
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,279
fix a computer issue they're going to be

275
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,880
like no it's this i'm like no

276
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,560
it's obviously not you guys don't know

277
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,720
how to do it i know how to do it

278
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,880
so this is how you do it so it's not

279
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,080
always right however i will say

280
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,519
with certain things like obviously

281
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,440
nursing because they come from a nursing

282
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,160
background with parents

283
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,600
they're always right or almost always

284
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,720
right with you know some things in their

285
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,480
knowledge because they've been nurses

286
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,480
for years so i feel like

287
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,000
if you're like an expert on something

288
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,560
then yeah you're gonna be

289
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,800
almost always right or somewhat always

290
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,680
right but not necessarily

291
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,120
always always always so in the end it's

292
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,200
a hard disagree that

293
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,720
your parents are always right but you

294
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,200
will have to agree that there are times

295
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,240
that they

296
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,480
are somewhat right so

297
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,399
in the end i will say somewhat discreet

298
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,800
it's just like going around around but

299
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,920
that's how i feel i guess and the number

300
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,959
third one is

301
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,760
god loves everyone equally i will

302
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,720
definitely say

303
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,760
strongly strongly agree now people will

304
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,760
disagree

305
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,959
and they can like look in the bible and

306
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,800
things like that and say like

307
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,959
well how come this person went through

308
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,279
this like jonah and the whale

309
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:03,200
or joseph like you know getting sold by

310
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,399
his brothers and things like that or

311
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,800
like other

312
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,600
people who have like perfect lives you

313
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,600
know

314
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,760
but it's more for me i think

315
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,680
god loves us all equally right but there

316
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,800
is a point in our lives

317
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,880
that god puts us through tests and

318
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,480
it might happen to you now it might

319
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,959
happen to you later

320
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,600
you know for example at the time i'm

321
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:30,320
recording this i had a really bad night

322
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,440
you know for a shift like i just wanted

323
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,839
to go

324
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,839
i wanted to leave as soon as possible

325
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,800
and once i gave report i was out the

326
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,519
building

327
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,120
and you know it was a really hard night

328
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,760
but i am still thankful that i made it

329
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,000
through and

330
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,000
god blessed me in the end because worser

331
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,800
things could have happened but we made

332
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,399
it through

333
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,079
and there are some days that i have the

334
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,560
best day and the calmest patients in the

335
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,240
world

336
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,680
and there are some days like this where

337
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,760
everything's just going wrong

338
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,200
and wrong every single hour of the night

339
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,120
and i don't know what to do with myself

340
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,760
but am i gonna blame god for that

341
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,920
absolutely not because i know in the end

342
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,640
there is always a light at the end of

343
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,880
the tunnel

344
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,160
and i am grateful for the things that he

345
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,680
has given me

346
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,360
and i know like my life i could say

347
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,279
for the most part has been quite good

348
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,079
and i am very blessed

349
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,839
to have the life that i have now have i

350
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,560
had like really hard struggles

351
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,880
of course everybody has them that's part

352
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,200
of

353
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,000
life and the life that god gives us you

354
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,600
know he

355
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,519
like i said before puts us through these

356
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,680
trials you know to test us

357
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,720
to test our willpower and our trust in

358
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,640
him and

359
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,720
you know other people start off their

360
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,200
life really really bad but in the end

361
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,120
you know later down their life maybe if

362
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,200
they trust in god more like

363
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,040
you know and help themselves as well you

364
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,680
know maybe they can go off to a better

365
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,640
future

366
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,959
you know because in like in life i feel

367
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,320
like god blesses you so much

368
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,240
the fact that your life is already a

369
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,680
blessing so you should be ready thankful

370
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,120
for that

371
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:01,120
but you know god blesses us

372
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,880
but at the same time if we don't like

373
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,839
help ourselves like how is he gonna

374
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,079
bless you right

375
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,880
like i'll say for example i talk like my

376
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,720
dad because i'm

377
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,000
rambling so much but i'm also trying to

378
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,920
make that 30 minute mark

379
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:17,600
but anyways so for example i'll say

380
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:19,839
you know it took me two years to pass my

381
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,519
nclex right and it was not an easy road

382
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,360
if you guys have watched my video i kind

383
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,079
of like talked about my backstory about

384
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,760
like not doing so well in school and not

385
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,240
taking things seriously but like

386
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,959
somehow making it and then like when i

387
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,720
come here

388
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,800
you know like i realized like well

389
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,320
there's really nothing to work

390
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,760
for like you know in school like there's

391
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,800
always like a new deadline and things

392
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,519
like that but

393
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,200
in real life after graduation you are

394
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,240
the one making your own deadlines in a

395
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,839
sense right

396
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:50,000
so my deadline was to you know

397
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,360
pass my nclex and start my job start my

398
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,800
career and start my life

399
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,560
so what did i have to do i had to start

400
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,920
working for it but

401
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,680
i was under the promotion i mean i

402
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,519
i trusted god but at the same time like

403
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,920
i i've doubted him a lot because i'm

404
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,160
like

405
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,760
you know i'm just kind of doing this

406
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,399
test especially my first one like

407
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,480
whatever

408
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,839
like i'll be okay and i knew i wasn't

409
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,839
gonna pass but i still

410
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,320
did it anyway i don't even know why and

411
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,440
i did it and i was crying and the second

412
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,720
and third

413
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:22,000
same thing you know did it didn't really

414
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,800
do my part still crying incessantly and

415
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,279
then i

416
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,680
came to the realization which i wish i

417
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,440
kind of had more realizations like this

418
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,279
in other aspects of my life and maybe i

419
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,440
will in the future you know

420
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,880
god's not gonna bless you if you also

421
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,440
don't put in your

422
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,920
due work as well you know because god

423
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:43,519
gave us wisdom he gave us willpower

424
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,839
so i put in my work and i really trusted

425
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,199
him

426
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,120
although there was a little bit of doubt

427
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,440
because i you know i'm a

428
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,160
terrible test taker with anxiety and

429
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,480
didn't

430
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,199
you know try my best so i felt like

431
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,480
whatever

432
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,720
like i'm just gonna go with the flow

433
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,120
right but in the end god bless me and i

434
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,440
was really shocked but also like so

435
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,800
absolutely thankful like had i not

436
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,120
trusted him

437
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,320
with my life in that moment or for that

438
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,600
past couple of

439
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:12,000
months studying what he had blessed me

440
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,079
with his uncles did i deserve it

441
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,040
you know probably not because i didn't

442
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:18,160
do my job

443
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:20,240
so when i feel like when people say just

444
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,079
like i'll do everything kind of thing

445
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,920
that puts a lot on him but it's also

446
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,959
like you need to do your job too you

447
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,680
know what i mean

448
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,880
but back to the topic of like god loves

449
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,079
everyone equally

450
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,360
it kind of like relates because like god

451
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:36,079
loves me so much

452
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,519
that he you know blessed me with this

453
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,920
career

454
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,760
but he also gave me the wisdom and he

455
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:45,279
loves me to bless me with that wisdom

456
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,480
so i could work hard and get what i want

457
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,360
because you know

458
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,240
i trust him so much and with that trust

459
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,519
and love

460
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:56,160
comes like great rewards so i am

461
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,720
absolutely thankful for all of that so

462
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,560
yeah

463
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,880
even though some people's lives might be

464
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,720
the best but there are rocky roads

465
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,639
always like it's not always like a

466
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,800
yellow paved road like a sweet

467
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,800
ride up to the top right there's always

468
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,079
gonna be something that's gonna

469
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,600
make your life hard but that doesn't

470
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,000
mean that god doesn't love you you know

471
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,000
like

472
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,279
jonah he was stuck in the whale didn't

473
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,920
want to prophesy

474
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,959
to other people you know he still

475
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,760
trusted god and

476
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:23,120
you know things worked out for him job

477
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,959
too i think job is like

478
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,560
a perfect example for that and people

479
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:29,279
try to tear them down and say your life

480
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,320
sucks like why don't you just like you

481
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,839
know

482
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,920
dismiss god or whatever because he's

483
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,680
obviously like doing all these terrible

484
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:39,199
things to you but you know in the end

485
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:41,839
things got better right so i think

486
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,759
god loves us all equally strongly agree

487
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,959
you just got to put your trust on him

488
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:48,399
and see where he takes you but also do

489
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,560
your part in the relationship

490
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,160
too because a relationship is a two-way

491
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,240
street it's not just one person putting

492
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,040
in 100 of the work you got to put in the

493
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,800
work too

494
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:03,040
so yeah and then the last question

495
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:05,680
is i would date someone not my religion

496
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,720
i feel like i have talked about this

497
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,920
with people

498
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,320
so much and

499
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,040
it's quite a controversial topic for a

500
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,480
lot of people in

501
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,560
my religion and i guess maybe other

502
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,079
religions too because obviously

503
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,839
when you think of marriage you would

504
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,560
want to be on the same boat right you

505
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,639
want

506
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,480
someone to have the same ideas with you

507
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,560
and more so

508
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,279
your children in the future like for

509
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,519
example i have a lot of relatives and

510
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,040
friends too that the husband and wife

511
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,440
are two different religions and the

512
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,440
children

513
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,440
are kind of confused on what to believe

514
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,880
in because their parents are strong in

515
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,399
their beliefs but they couldn't come to

516
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,839
a compromise per se

517
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,720
and i never want to have that i mean to

518
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,839
be honest i am

519
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,720
a product of parents with two different

520
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,360
religions but

521
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,279
my mom ended up converting you know to

522
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,000
my dad's religion which is how we all

523
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,720
grew up

524
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,360
but actually in the marriage very early

525
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,079
on

526
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,360
even like past i was born like maybe

527
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,839
four or five i think

528
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,600
my mom would say that my dad was

529
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,880
generally okay with things but at the

530
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,720
same time he was kind of like

531
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,760
as long as you don't eat you know things

532
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,480
you're not supposed to eat in front of

533
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,079
the kids

534
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,319
it's fine so they won't get confused

535
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:16,079
right so my mom would have to like sneak

536
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,760
off and like hang out with friends and

537
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,360
do what she wanted to do kind of thing

538
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,839
but she didn't want to live like that

539
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,679
so she ended up you know converting well

540
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,160
actually what also happened was my dad

541
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,360
and her had to talk about it whoever can

542
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,240
kind of like

543
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,880
convert the other person better you know

544
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,799
kind of

545
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,080
wins the argument that sounds really bad

546
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,320
but it's kind of like

547
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,440
if you were so strong in your beliefs

548
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,280
you would fight

549
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,880
to be the same as your partner kind of

550
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,520
things so

551
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,000
i guess it's kind of like that but for

552
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,480
me

553
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,679
i guess because seeing like a product of

554
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,720
my parents and other

555
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,000
like strong marriages with you know

556
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,000
husband and wife being two different

557
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,679
ones and hopefully converting i would

558
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,880
hope to be the same

559
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:02,480
which is why i'm like somewhat open

560
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:04,240
to like date people who are not the same

561
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,679
religion as me because

562
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:10,080
i feel like i have grown so much in

563
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,679
learning about my religion and knowing

564
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,000
what i personally believe it and not

565
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,919
just

566
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,280
what i grew up with based on what my

567
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,480
parents believe in and kind of

568
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,919
like you know being in the same mindset

569
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,320
as them like believing what they believe

570
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,559
in

571
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,080
and for their reasons but no like

572
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,720
discovering it myself

573
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,440
and really taking it to home and

574
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,919
understanding

575
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,200
like what i believe in in this religion

576
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,200
like certain things like that especially

577
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,720
like diet is like the biggest thing in

578
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:39,520
you know my religion so um i

579
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,000
do not mind entertaining other people

580
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,360
because

581
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,559
i feel like when i meet guys that are in

582
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,280
the same religion me

583
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,400
or have met it's either they're super

584
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,200
conservative

585
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,480
or they're super liberal like there's no

586
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,919
in between like

587
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,840
i want to go to church every single

588
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,919
saturday but you're also gonna catch me

589
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,520
at a bts concert because i like them

590
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,200
or like any korean concert you know what

591
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,200
i mean it's like things like that like

592
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,480
you gotta have it like a little leeway

593
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,840
but honestly

594
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,080
sometimes i think about how there's

595
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:11,840
someone in the same religion as me

596
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:13,360
because like maybe they're there for me

597
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,760
because they're waiting for me to you

598
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:19,039
know submit my life and change

599
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,400
my way of living for god so i don't know

600
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,480
it's kind of like that too but

601
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,600
as of right now i am very open to the

602
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,360
fact of it

603
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,960
and i'm also thinking about like in the

604
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,480
future like

605
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,559
maybe that other person that other

606
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,400
religion is waiting for me

607
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,600
to change their life and to bring them

608
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,280
closer to god

609
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,200
not that they're not closer to god but

610
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,760
like you know like something

611
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,240
else and i feel like like i said before

612
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,160
like i

613
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,919
am quite strong enough to kind of

614
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,360
convince them to go my way but obviously

615
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,080
like it's not gonna work it's not gonna

616
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,200
work

617
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,960
um but also if it does happen i mean i

618
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,000
hope we would come to a compromise of

619
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,120
things happening

620
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,440
especially with the intention of

621
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,720
marriage like i was thinking before

622
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,240
that i wanted to date only for the sole

623
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,600
intention of marriage but i feel like

624
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,000
that's cutting a lot of people off

625
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,520
because

626
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,640
obviously marriage is such a big thing

627
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,120
especially if you're meeting someone

628
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,360
that

629
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,159
only has the attention of it so i don't

630
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,840
mind

631
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,679
i guess entertaining is a wrong word but

632
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,520
like meeting people and getting to know

633
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,919
people who are different religions as me

634
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,240
or

635
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,440
maybe not a religion but you know i

636
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,159
don't think there's anything wrong with

637
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,880
that

638
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:22,400
and you know who knows because i could

639
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,159
be a blessing in their life

640
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,600
but i'm definitely not opposed to it

641
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,000
because i feel like if you're

642
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,679
only like looking at your own religion

643
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,400
you are really closing off

644
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,159
some like good people out there whose

645
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,240
maybe it might be the one for you if

646
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:39,280
you're not closing yourself off to only

647
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:42,400
one demographic you know so

648
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,840
it's kind of like that but again like i

649
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:47,520
would say

650
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,640
i somewhat to strongly agree that i

651
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,320
would date someone

652
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,840
not my religion because i want to be

653
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,640
more open-minded you know

654
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,960
especially when i went to the

655
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,480
philippines i met so many people that

656
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,400
even though i went to a private

657
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,000
university of my religion

658
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,919
i met so many people of different

659
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,360
denominations that it kind of opened my

660
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,360
mind to different things

661
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,400
so i feel like after that experience and

662
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,280
coming from

663
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,720
a place that was only people i met were

664
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,480
solely my religion

665
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,000
it was so nice it was like a breath of

666
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,240
fresh air to meet new people

667
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,039
and to you know learn about a lot of

668
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,679
things

669
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:21,280
so it just opened my mind better and

670
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,679
made me happy to know

671
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,280
you know there's actually like sometimes

672
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,280
better people out there

673
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,960
than people you meet only in your own

674
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,679
religion and sometimes i feel kind of

675
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,280
bored

676
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,799
like what i said before with the men

677
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,480
i've met in my own religion because they

678
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:36,559
could either be really toxic which

679
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,159
some of them were and some of them were

680
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:40,480
kind of like

681
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,159
like kind of like too good for you and

682
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,039
kind of suffocating because of the way

683
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,720
they live and

684
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,320
you they look at you and they're like

685
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:50,080
ugh you kind of like that

686
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:52,880
makes you look like a bad you know

687
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,400
christian kind of thing so i felt like

688
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,679
insecure feeling like that so i guess

689
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,440
that's why i was like

690
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,799
i have like now the mindset of like

691
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,480
being open to people from other

692
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:04,240
religions but

693
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,760
yeah i would say strongly agree that i

694
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,440
would date someone not very religious

695
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,000
when it comes to marriage i'm still

696
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,600
not quite sure of that i think from what

697
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,880
i've been saying before that i'm leaning

698
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,240
more towards the

699
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,919
i would rather have someone of the same

700
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,360
religion but if it doesn't work out the

701
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,640
way and the one that's meant for me is

702
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,919
not my religion

703
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,880
i would hope that we'd come to a

704
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:26,080
compromise somehow and

705
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:28,400
more so on the i really would

706
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,000
like to convert him to mine but

707
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,960
obviously if it doesn't work out then it

708
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,799
doesn't work out

709
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,600
and we have to compromise somehow

710
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:38,480
because it's going to be hard so

711
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,640
i think that was all the questions i

712
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,360
really drew it out because

713
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,840
i felt like it was going to be so like

714
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,120
short

715
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:49,760
with all my discussions but to recap

716
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,360
i like christian music i went through

717
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,600
all the subcategories but the median

718
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:56,640
answer was somewhat agree

719
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,080
my parents are always right disagree god

720
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,919
loves everyone equally

721
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,159
strongly agree and i would date someone

722
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:04,640
not my religion strongly agree

723
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,679
so with that there will be a part two

724
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,559
eventually

725
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,960
when they decide to do it again i did

726
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,440
say

727
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,679
like if they will do it again i would do

728
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,280
it like in person and live because i

729
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,080
will not miss the afternoon program this

730
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,440
time but

731
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,159
if they don't and they do it again

732
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,640
online then i will answer the questions

733
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:24,240
again on another podcast episode but i

734
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,799
hope you guys enjoyed it and gained some

735
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,919
insight of me as a person in terms of my

736
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,240
religion

737
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,919
and kind of you know understand what i'm

738
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,240
coming from and maybe you can relate to

739
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,000
it

740
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,360
and you know if you want to answer these

741
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,039
questions yourself and let me know of

742
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,720
your answers and we can have

743
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,080
a nice healthy discussion about it you

744
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,440
know because maybe there's like an

745
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,679
opinion i haven't heard

746
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,200
but i'm also open to hearing just let me

747
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,520
know in the comments down below or

748
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,240
