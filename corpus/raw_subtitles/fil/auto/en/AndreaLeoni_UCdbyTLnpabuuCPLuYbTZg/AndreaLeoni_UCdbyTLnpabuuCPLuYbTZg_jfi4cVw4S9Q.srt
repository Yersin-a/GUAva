00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,420
hey guys today I will be talking about

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:10,620
growing up Asian American grown up

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:13,400
Filipino American one of my favorite

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:16,680
youtubers Amy Lee aka vagabond youth

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,990
created this tag the series of questions

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,730
that anyone can answer

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,890
I watched her video I watched Jenna's

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,710
video it's very interesting to see the

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,869
different experiences that she has

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,910
versus what I have or what some other

11
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:32,130
Asian American has I'm gonna go through

12
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:36,290
these questions talk about my experience

13
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:41,050
my upbringing and I hope you enjoy

14
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:43,360
I identify as filipino-american

15
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:45,400
both my parents immigrated here to

16
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,610
America my dad first arrived in

17
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:51,640
California my mom in New Jersey and so

18
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:55,050
being born in America I therefore in

19
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,050
first generation American

20
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:04,670
so I think my first memory of being a

21
00:01:02,089 --> 00:01:07,399
minority or a different ethnicity as

22
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:09,890
others in my community growing up I

23
00:01:07,399 --> 00:01:11,899
think it was first grade we were playing

24
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:14,240
recess we were outside the playground

25
00:01:11,899 --> 00:01:15,979
chasing each other playing Thai then I'm

26
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,740
over on the other side doing gymnastics

27
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:21,110
with some of the other girls because

28
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:25,220
that's what I was into and I did a split

29
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:27,560
and this boy saw me do that and he looks

30
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:29,539
at me points at me and says really loud

31
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,729
to everyone else the playground the

32
00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:34,970
oldest Chinese girl just did a split and

33
00:01:31,729 --> 00:01:36,950
in my head I was like I'm not Chinese

34
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:39,950
what and at that age when I would tell

35
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:41,810
kids that I was Filipino or my parents

36
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:43,880
were from the Philippines they almost

37
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:46,340
didn't believe me because I didn't know

38
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:49,429
it was a country it was easy for people

39
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:52,009
to pinpoint you as Chinese because when

40
00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:54,470
they don't care to ask what your

41
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:57,380
ethnicity is they automatically assume

42
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:59,840
you're Chinese and yes he was a kid he

43
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:01,610
didn't know at the time but it did

44
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,129
offend me and I remember another time

45
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:06,679
when I was in Washington DC and this is

46
00:02:04,129 --> 00:02:09,440
when I was pretty young as well I was

47
00:02:06,679 --> 00:02:10,759
with my family visiting from California

48
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,300
and we were there to see the Cherry

49
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:13,879
Blossom

50
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:15,920
you know just walk around the city and I

51
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:18,590
remember we were leaving the parking lot

52
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,720
and going towards this park area by the

53
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:22,790
river catching this crosswalk and there

54
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,560
was a tour bus right next to us and the

55
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:26,569
man driving the tour bus who called out

56
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,030
the window to us mining our own business

57
00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:31,610
and he goes Nihao at the time I did not

58
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:32,989
know that meant hello in Chinese I

59
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,550
didn't know that so I was confused

60
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:38,560
because I thought he was saying meow

61
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:38,560
like a like a cat

62
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:45,340
thinking about this question the first

63
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:47,860
thing that comes to mind was in

64
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,930
elementary school and it was lunchtime I

65
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,490
used to pack my lunch whatever was left

66
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:53,500
over for dinner whatever my mom just

67
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:55,540
packed me I just took my lunchbox from

68
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:58,570
the table and went to school she likes

69
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:01,420
to cook traditional Filipino food and I

70
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:03,580
eat it I like it but as a kid bringing

71
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:05,950
that type of food to school especially

72
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:09,310
in elementary school people are going to

73
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:12,070
smell that the aroma of Asian food just

74
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:14,170
lingers and in elementary school I hated

75
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:15,670
the attention the attention that I got

76
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:17,800
from when I brought food like that

77
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:20,170
pretend this is my lunch box and it

78
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:23,380
opens like this I would always have my

79
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:25,600
lunch box closed and if I wanted a bit

80
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,880
of something to eat I would just stick

81
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,280
my hand slightly like this grab what I

82
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:33,160
needed and took it out I remember coming

83
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,900
home and refusing to pack my lunch I

84
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,300
didn't want that people would see what

85
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,770
you have for lunch and go you know what

86
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:41,050
is that and after they say a comment

87
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:43,660
like that you don't want to eat it even

88
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:46,360
if it is your favorite dish at home I

89
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:48,970
think after that instance I just would

90
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,800
buy my lunch I would tell my mom to give

91
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:53,350
me lunch money even though I didn't

92
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,870
really enjoy the school lunches but that

93
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:58,150
kept up for a long time of me just buy

94
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:59,590
my lunch never packing food and I think

95
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:01,990
that was the first instance of when I

96
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:04,690
rejected my heritage because of the food

97
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:06,190
because people saw the food that I

98
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,920
brought to school and didn't like what

99
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:10,959
they received and so I as a child who

100
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,880
wanted to fit in saw this as a bad thing

101
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,530
I wanted my parents to cook more

102
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,630
American food I wanted my parents to

103
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:19,000
pack me sandwiches like normal kids

104
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:22,210
parents would for a long time I was not

105
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,430
proud of who I was because of the

106
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:26,110
repercussions I got from that my parents

107
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,790
being from the Philippines they had a

108
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:29,470
pretty thick accent with my friends

109
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:32,110
growing up would talk to them I would

110
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:33,970
get nervous because I didn't want them

111
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:37,120
to make fun of my parents for not

112
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:38,830
speaking properly or clearly and school

113
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,680
I never brought friends home one because

114
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:44,680
yeah I was embarrassed by my parents I

115
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,810
was embarrassed by the scent of my home

116
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,729
because I remember one time someone came

117
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:50,650
into my house and they told me it

118
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:51,970
smelled like spices I didn't take that

119
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,380
as a good thing I was like oh my

120
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,810
goodness

121
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:56,670
my house smells like spices I need it

122
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:59,250
for breeze this place up or something I

123
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:01,140
just never brought anyone here to hang

124
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:03,690
out and I barely had people sleep over

125
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:05,730
because when it was time for dinner my

126
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:07,830
mom would make her traditional Filipino

127
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:09,780
food I would like it but I would get

128
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:12,870
nervous that the people that I brought

129
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:14,790
to my house would be super picky not

130
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:18,540
like it would make fun of the food and

131
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:20,760
so me being so on edge never wanted

132
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:24,390
anyone to come to my house ever it was

133
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:27,000
like I was just hiding all of it hiding

134
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:30,150
everything now I think growing up I'm

135
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,210
definitely more proud to be Filipino my

136
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:35,370
American I have a background that's

137
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:37,800
unlike most people's I have a better

138
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:39,900
understanding for immigrants in America

139
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,210
and what they go through you know

140
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:44,250
watching my parents hearing their

141
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:46,860
stories especially my dad hearing him

142
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:48,870
talk about how he was every job ever

143
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,600
when he first came here he was a janitor

144
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:53,910
he got stuck in an elevator because he

145
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,560
didn't know how elevators work he went

146
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:57,150
to nursery school for his associates

147
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,980
started working as a nurse took more

148
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:01,200
online classes got his bachelor's in

149
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:03,450
nursing and he went to school as an

150
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:06,540
engineer in the Philippines he's a smart

151
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:09,570
man and he worked so hard for what he

152
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:11,880
has and what he's provided for me and my

153
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:14,580
siblings I just did not understand

154
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,680
rather I didn't even know about or cared

155
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:18,600
to know about but now I'm more proud of

156
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,390
where I came from more proud of what my

157
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:24,140
parents have done to provide for a

158
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:24,140
better life for me

159
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:29,420
I own a me video and Jen ends video they

160
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:32,750
talk about the model minority men which

161
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:35,360
is something that I think all Asians

162
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:38,210
struggle with you are put in this high

163
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,550
regard because you are Asian that you

164
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:41,120
have to be smart especially in math and

165
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:44,120
science

166
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,310
my parents growing up wanted me to be in

167
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:49,160
the medical field they wanted me to be a

168
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:52,280
nurse just like them but I'm just not

169
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,750
good with math and science plus I didn't

170
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,670
want to be a nurse or in the medical

171
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:59,390
field and I think also running up Asian

172
00:06:55,670 --> 00:07:01,520
we are expected to excel in whatever we

173
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:04,400
do when you have your report card in

174
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:07,100
high school and even in college and you

175
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,700
get a B that's like unacceptable

176
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:12,710
we are just put on this higher standard

177
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:14,960
because of the race that we were born

178
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:17,150
into and that can be super super

179
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,450
detrimental another stereotype I

180
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:23,060
struggle with is the passive Asian woman

181
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:25,700
I think for me I'm very out there I like

182
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:27,650
to be bold but I have my own thoughts I

183
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:30,920
have my own opinions and I own feelings

184
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:33,410
and it's really difficult for me to want

185
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,820
to even play this passive role another

186
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:37,010
thing I struggle with that goes along

187
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:39,710
with people outside of your race and

188
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:41,930
it's identifying you as another

189
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:45,230
ethnicity is the fact that we all look

190
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:48,110
the same now I grew up and a small beach

191
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:52,460
town in South Jersey and there's a very

192
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:54,980
very very small Filipino community in

193
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:58,700
South Jersey so a lot of my mom's

194
00:07:54,980 --> 00:08:00,770
friends at work are Filipino because

195
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:03,050
there's a small community of Filipinos

196
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:04,310
people think that we're all related it's

197
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:07,160
kind of just difficult because other

198
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:09,440
people think that because you're from

199
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:13,000
one country that you know everyone in

200
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,000
that country and that's just not true

201
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:18,530
so the national language in the

202
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:20,390
Philippines is called Tagalog and the

203
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:23,600
Spanish rule in the Philippines for over

204
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:26,510
300 years many words in Tagalog are very

205
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,830
very similar or the same as the Spanish

206
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:29,960
language and because I was learning

207
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:32,270
Spanish this past semester I was able to

208
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:35,450
understand bits and pieces a little bit

209
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:36,380
better in Tagalog than prior to learning

210
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,090
Spanish

211
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,770
that being said I still don't know

212
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:41,030
Tagalog and it's kind of difficult

213
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:44,390
because when I went to the Philippines

214
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:47,030
about 3 summers ago with my mom we went

215
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:49,700
to the place where she grew up so I've

216
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:52,040
cousins their aunts their grandparents

217
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:54,290
their great aunts whatever me being the

218
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,960
one who didn't speak Tagalog it was very

219
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:58,250
difficult to communicate with my family

220
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,960
members they knew a little bit of

221
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:02,290
English and they would speak to me but

222
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:04,670
it wouldn't be a full in-depth

223
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:06,350
conversation I'd probably be like one

224
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:08,510
question or two and then they'd go back

225
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:10,610
turn us someone else and start talking

226
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:13,070
Tagalog and while we were there my

227
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:15,230
cousins who have been learning English

228
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:16,910
in school didn't want to talk to me for

229
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:20,000
the longest time we were only there for

230
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:22,310
two weeks and they kinda were just

231
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,660
avoiding me especially in the beginning

232
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:25,940
because I think they were just

233
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:27,890
embarrassed to speak English and to

234
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,840
practice their English with me so I

235
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:31,970
think it's just being my mom and I there

236
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:35,780
and me not having the support of my

237
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:38,570
other siblings I didn't talk a lot

238
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:40,550
dirty' not sure and it seems funny but

239
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:43,790
it's very hard when you want to

240
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:46,010
communicate with your relatives

241
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:48,170
especially those from another country

242
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:49,670
you want to hear what it's like you want

243
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,500
to hear their experience their stories

244
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:53,990
but when they don't want to talk to you

245
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:56,920
or even try talking to you it's very

246
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,920
hard

247
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:03,970
so along with the language barrier I

248
00:10:01,989 --> 00:10:06,189
think there's also language barrier with

249
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:08,799
my parents now they'd been in America

250
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:11,109
for years they speak to God look at home

251
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:13,419
to each other and sometimes when they're

252
00:10:11,109 --> 00:10:15,579
telling stories to each other they tell

253
00:10:13,419 --> 00:10:17,019
it in Tagalog and sometimes I'm curious

254
00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:19,749
and I want to know what they're saying

255
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:22,809
so I go mom what did you say and

256
00:10:19,749 --> 00:10:24,429
sometimes she registers that I'm asking

257
00:10:22,809 --> 00:10:27,159
me for asking her what she said so she

258
00:10:24,429 --> 00:10:29,979
repeats in to God look I said no in

259
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:31,949
English and I feel because there is that

260
00:10:29,979 --> 00:10:34,089
language barrier you're not fully

261
00:10:31,949 --> 00:10:36,099
communicating and I think for me

262
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:38,919
learning that communication is very

263
00:10:36,099 --> 00:10:41,109
important it's just difficult when your

264
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:42,789
parent just prefer to speak in Tagalog

265
00:10:41,109 --> 00:10:45,729
but you were never taught that you were

266
00:10:42,789 --> 00:10:47,499
never brought up speaking to God their

267
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:49,569
reasoning behind it was that they didn't

268
00:10:47,499 --> 00:10:51,639
want us to have the accent that they had

269
00:10:49,569 --> 00:10:54,220
grown up here and they didn't want our

270
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:56,349
accent learning Tagalog to interfere

271
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:59,349
with us learning English in addition

272
00:10:56,349 --> 00:11:02,139
growing up in an Asian household you

273
00:10:59,349 --> 00:11:04,089
don't really have a strong communication

274
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:07,389
in the first place a lot of Asian people

275
00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:09,039
are more enclosed into themselves so I

276
00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:11,499
don't have those deep conversations with

277
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:12,699
my parents also not realizing what

278
00:11:11,499 --> 00:11:15,189
they've been through

279
00:11:12,699 --> 00:11:18,789
coming here growing up in the

280
00:11:15,189 --> 00:11:21,819
Philippines raising us here in America

281
00:11:18,789 --> 00:11:24,669
it's all different growing up American

282
00:11:21,819 --> 00:11:26,229
in an Asian household and when your

283
00:11:24,669 --> 00:11:28,119
relationship with your parents do not

284
00:11:26,229 --> 00:11:29,949
align with the relationship of your

285
00:11:28,119 --> 00:11:32,049
friends with their parents you kind of

286
00:11:29,949 --> 00:11:34,119
started getting upset and questioning

287
00:11:32,049 --> 00:11:36,339
things why aren't we that close because

288
00:11:34,119 --> 00:11:39,129
of language barriers maybe because of

289
00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:42,509
the fact that Asians are a lot of the

290
00:11:39,129 --> 00:11:42,509
times to themselves

291
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:49,670
now I am 20 years old I've definitely I

292
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:52,879
think since coming to college I've

293
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:55,790
wanted to explore that side of me more I

294
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:58,160
am nowhere near where I want to be with

295
00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:01,160
my heritage now but I'm working on it

296
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,919
I'm growing on it and I recognize now

297
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:07,009
that it is something to be super proud

298
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:09,919
of what I want is to see in general more

299
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:13,279
Asian Americans being represented

300
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:15,290
because we are freaking awesome let me

301
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,600
just tell you that I get the best of

302
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:20,059
both worlds all the food you could ever

303
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:23,119
imagine and I have this strong

304
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:25,720
background being Filipino and the rich

305
00:12:23,119 --> 00:12:25,720
history

306
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:31,230
like I said the food you got egg rolls

307
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:34,050
and you got hamburgers my favorite thing

308
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:37,110
about being asian-american is also the

309
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:40,530
pride I feel like there is that pride to

310
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:43,590
be both Filipino and American can be

311
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:45,750
Filipino in a competition in the UK and

312
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:47,460
your face will be on the Filipino

313
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:50,160
channel because that's how much pride

314
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:52,170
they have for their people whether you

315
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,240
were born in the Philippines or not and

316
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:57,150
just some closing remarks closing

317
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,160
thoughts on me talking about growing up

318
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:02,820
Asian American in honor of Asian Pacific

319
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:05,970
Heritage Month I not only wanted to do

320
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:08,430
this before talk about being a Filipino

321
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:12,030
American I wanted to also just in

322
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:14,910
general celebrate me celebrate how far

323
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:17,250
I've come in this journey of this

324
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:19,890
feeling of rejecting everything that I

325
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:23,040
am because I was born American I grew up

326
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:25,680
in America there may be some disconnect

327
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,030
from me and the Philippines just because

328
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,370
I wasn't born there doesn't mean I

329
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:32,100
shouldn't feel the pride and show the

330
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:35,280
support that I have for this country

331
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:37,740
where my ancestors my parents everyone

332
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,390
before me grew up was raised I hope you

333
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:43,260
enjoyed that you learned a little bit

334
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:46,170
about me I will put Amy's and Jenn's

335
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:48,450
video down below go check that out you

336
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:51,450
all have very different yet at points

337
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:53,100
very similar experiences and maybe this

338
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:55,050
is just a topic you've never thought

339
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,120
about and this isn't an ad or anything

340
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:59,010
but I just want to end with this one

341
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,600
statement that there is a movie coming

342
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:02,180
out it looks really good I watched the

343
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:06,180
trailer it's called crazy rich Asians

344
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:08,790
it's an entire cast of Asians and it

345
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:10,470
looks like a very good rom-com I think

346
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:12,000
it comes out in August that information

347
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:14,340
