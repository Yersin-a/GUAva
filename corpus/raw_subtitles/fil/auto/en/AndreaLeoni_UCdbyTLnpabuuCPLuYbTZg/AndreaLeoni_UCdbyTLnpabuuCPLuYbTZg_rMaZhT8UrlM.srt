1
00:00:02,899 --> 00:00:11,820
freshly brewed vanilla caramel black tea

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:13,980
I don't even want to put this welcome to

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,250
the first installment of here's the tea

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:20,910
my vlogs do a really good job of

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:23,430
highlighting the ups and hiding the pits

6
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,470
and the Falls of college and life in

7
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,869
general recently I watched Timmy

8
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,369
Lovato's documentary it's free on

9
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:31,380
YouTube if you haven't watched it and I

10
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:34,559
totally recommend one of the first line

11
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:36,809
she says in her documentary is in order

12
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,420
to be happy you have to speak your truth

13
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:43,050
and I really took that to heart because

14
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:45,480
I'm one of those people who really wants

15
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:48,120
to speak their truth and I had this

16
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,280
platform that you're watching me on

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,699
currently where I have the opportunity

18
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:57,899
to showcase my life as a temple student

19
00:00:53,699 --> 00:01:01,109
and to show you what an average day

20
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:04,199
average weekend whatever is like for me

21
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:07,799
and from all the people that I've met on

22
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:12,000
campus and just commenting on my videos

23
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:15,090
a lot of people tell me that I'm one of

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,400
the reasons why they came to Temple or

25
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:20,490
they chose temple and that to me is very

26
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,470
overwhelming sometimes like I would say

27
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,509
thank you I would say that's so sweet of

28
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:27,619
you but when I actually had the chance

29
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:33,270
to sit down and think about that and

30
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:35,460
actually process that people watch my

31
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:40,079
videos to see if they would like it here

32
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:41,820
and you don't see an everyday life of a

33
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:46,890
student when you go on a tour to college

34
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:48,720
which is one of the factors why I wanted

35
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:51,210
to make this channel why I wanted to

36
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,079
start vlogging in college but the main

37
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:58,380
reason why I wanted to start vlogging is

38
00:01:54,079 --> 00:02:00,719
just reminisce because College like

39
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,540
everyone says goes by super fast and I'm

40
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:06,450
almost halfway done college like that's

41
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:09,420
mind-blowing to me but these vlogs are

42
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:12,420
always showing what's good because I

43
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,830
want to look back in like five ten years

44
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,730
from now after I graduate

45
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:22,740
maybe what I even have kids and I'm like

46
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:27,630
wow I was a weird child I was a wild

47
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:30,270
teen it's great that I enjoyed this and

48
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:33,390
I'm vlogging because I like it

49
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:36,900
and I'm continuing vlogging because I

50
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:39,450
like it but I think something that will

51
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:43,050
be beneficial to not only me mentally

52
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:45,030
but to other people looking to come to

53
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:47,490
Temple or just go to college in general

54
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,620
or just seeing the transition from high

55
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:52,200
school to leaving your hometown and

56
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:54,000
going to a different state I think

57
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:59,250
something that will be beneficial is if

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:02,930
I started serious like this and I became

59
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:06,750
a bit more vulnerable with you and

60
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:10,830
talked about more serious issues and

61
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:13,920
maybe even just serious global issues

62
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:16,470
and just issues in general because as a

63
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,780
college student I found that people

64
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:21,300
become more aware and I love temple

65
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,860
because it is such an open environment

66
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:26,580
everyone's so friendly

67
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:29,040
and it's a sense of community when

68
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:31,620
you're there and you feel the need to

69
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,300
take action and participate because this

70
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,489
is your life and as a college student I

71
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:38,459
think we have to be woke about issues

72
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:41,790
like that and so I want to talk about it

73
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:43,770
but I want to be more open and I feel

74
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:46,230
like I think about this in all the

75
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:49,920
videos that I make I want to be more

76
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:53,370
open be more vulnerable I want to give

77
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:57,270
you insight on me I feel like I have a

78
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:59,190
lot to say but I never think I have the

79
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:01,620
right words to say them so hopefully

80
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:05,760
when I go back to edit videos like this

81
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:07,830
then it makes sense that I am saying

82
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,080
what I want to say and saying it clearly

83
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:12,000
and effectively I brought this idea up

84
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,959
to a few people and they seem to like it

85
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,150
a few months ago I was interviewed by

86
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:21,450
this girl for a class project she

87
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:24,750
contacted me asking me to get

88
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:27,120
interviewed about she's first which is

89
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:29,039
one of the organizations I'm involved

90
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,020
with on campus I met with her at the

91
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:33,539
Student Center and we chatted we had a

92
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,890
really nice conversation and she started

93
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:36,600
asking me questions about she's the

94
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:38,130
first then she started asking me

95
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,720
questions about my YouTube channel and

96
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:41,910
one of the questions she asked was

97
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,700
something along the lines of if I'm

98
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:48,060
going to use my platform on YouTube to

99
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:51,870
be an activist and to take action and to

100
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:54,690
just have a discussion about issues that

101
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:57,780
matter and I've always had this video

102
00:04:54,690 --> 00:05:02,550
idea in my head a few months ago as well

103
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:05,490
I came up with this series title here's

104
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:07,050
the tea and I think it fits because

105
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:10,260
there's a lot that I have gone through

106
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:11,760
that I would like to talk about but but

107
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,380
I'm too afraid to do that

108
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,570
it's because I'm afraid of being

109
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:18,479
vulnerable but I am the type of person

110
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:23,010
to challenge myself and that kind of

111
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:25,710
includes being more open because I think

112
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:28,560
it's not a sign of weakness I think it's

113
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:31,050
more of a sign that you know who you are

114
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,510
and you're willing to share that with

115
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:34,560
the rest of the world even though like I

116
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:37,289
don't even know how many people are

117
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:41,539
gonna watch this but for me I think it's

118
00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:44,550
beneficial selfishly because I need to

119
00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:48,090
release the inner thoughts in my head

120
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:49,830
some way shape or form and sometimes we

121
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:52,860
do that through journaling sometimes I

122
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:58,229
do that through talking to myself but

123
00:05:52,860 --> 00:06:01,710
those two things by itself alone do not

124
00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:04,320
satisfy my need to just say all this

125
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:05,880
information and to let people know about

126
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:09,390
all this information that's in my head

127
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:11,700
cuz I have a lot to say and a lot of

128
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:14,610
that is not shown in vlogs because my

129
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:16,710
vlogs are mostly live like what I'm

130
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:19,470
doing I tell you what I'm doing then and

131
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:21,690
then now a lot of it's not what's in my

132
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:24,479
head and a lot of things are in my head

133
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:28,050
and so it has resulted in the birth of

134
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:30,240
this series which I'm really excited to

135
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:33,630
start I feel like this was more of like

136
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:38,430
an intro video I have a lot

137
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:42,900
if more more specific topics to indulge

138
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:45,120
myself in and just talk about also I

139
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:48,510
really wish I had a cuter mug at home

140
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:51,180
this is just a plain simple dark brown

141
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:53,460
bug all my cute ones are in my door and

142
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:56,640
back attempt oh this is just sad

143
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:59,040
so sad side note before I go let me know

144
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:02,490
what kind of topics you want me to talk

145
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:06,870
about I know I have my own issues that I

146
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:09,000
want to touch on but if there's anything

147
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:11,370
that college related or if there's

148
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,010
anything I don't know you can think of

149
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:15,990
that you think I would do a good job

150
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,950
talking about please let me know in the

151
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:19,400
comments below

152
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,400
cool
