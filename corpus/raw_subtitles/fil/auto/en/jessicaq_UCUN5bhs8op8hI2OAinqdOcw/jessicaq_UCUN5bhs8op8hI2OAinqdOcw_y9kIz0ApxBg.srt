beautiful like olive green color

35
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,359
i feel like this color really

36
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,640
complements tan skin especially during

37
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,479
the winter time like i don't know about

38
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,320

39
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,240

40
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,000
and the melanin so i really appreciate

41
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,520
it this is such good quality it's really

42
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
thick material and during the winter

43
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,560
obviously

44
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,400
it gets cold so this material does keep

45
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,400
you warm and it's a ribbed material and

46
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,240
it's just like a button-down cropped

47
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,080
cardigan type top and i really love the

48
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,439

49
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,360
okay how am i gonna show this to y'all

00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,720
let me stand up as you can see the crop

51
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,159
is like right under my boob

52
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,600
it's like just perfect to where it like

53
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,280
flatters your waist make me look like i

54
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,720
have a snatched waist so yeah it's like

55
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,640
one of my new favorite tops i got it in

56
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,840
an extra extra small and it's just

57
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,520
amazing and i guess i'll just show you

58
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,520
my sweatpants too because they are also

59
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,799
from princess polly these sweatpants

60
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:46,079
are so comfortable like

61
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,759
uh they have this like check not checker

62
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,040
board it's kind of like a quilted

63
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,079
pattern i don't know how to explain it

64
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,240
but it looks like these

65
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,200
and the texture is really cool it has a

66
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,200
thick waistband

67
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,960
so it's so comfortable and it just

68
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,799
cinches you in fleece sweatpants are so

69
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,719
baggy but this thick waistband

70
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,640
gives you a little bit of a shape so you

71
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,719
don't look too much like a

72
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,680
blob and it's a nice light gray color so

73
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,200
it goes with like

74
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,800
everything and it cinches in at the

75
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,080
ankles so it's like the typical jogger

76
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,200
fit it's so soft

77
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,640
and um i love these sweatpants so much

78
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,400
10 out of 10 do you recommend if you

79
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,160

80
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,319

pick it up in this beautiful jade

88
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,319
sage green color this is a really thick

89
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,840
material again really good for the

90
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,440
winter time because this will keep you

91
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,280
warm and it's such good quality it

92
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,959
stretches out the waistband so you know

93
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,519
you have room for a food baby

94
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,239

95
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,319

96
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,080
see it's just the cutest little pleated

97
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,440

98
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,879

so girly i love it

101
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,480
i feel like a princess i also decided to

102
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,560
pick it up in this pink color because

103
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,760
i love pink oh it just looks like a

104
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,440
little bubble gum color

105
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,519
okay i'm gonna try this one on okay this

106
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,239

108
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,599
it's the cutest bubble gum pink and

109
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,720
again just cinches you in

110
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,080
oh she's skinny okay i

111
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,159
recommend these skirts they also have

112
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,239
them in so many other colors so

113
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,840
might have to cop the skirt in every

114
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,080
other color available so since we're on

115
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,920
the

116
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,400

cropped i will say that but it's such

120
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,360
thick material so it does still keep you

144
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,000
pink and white gingham gingham gingham

145
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,919
gingham pattern looks like a picnic

146
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,160
tablecloth but um i love it

147
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,359
also i tend to sweat when i'm cold i

148
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,759
sweat when i'm hot too

149
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:26,000
i just sweat armpits they get pretty

150
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,080
spicy but this leaves a lot of room to

151
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
breathe and it is pretty cropped but it

152
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,440
stays in place nothing is going to be

153
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,360
exposed and you can also

154
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,800
unclasp the buttons but i'm not going to

155
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,320
be doing that because that is not what

156
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,680
this type of video is

157
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,520
i'm going to put some jeans on to see

158
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,520
what this would look like with denim

159
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,960
okay these jeans are also from princess

160
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,560
paulie these are just the holly

161
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,000
asymmetrical jeans i bought these a

162
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,759
couple months ago with like my own money

163
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,440
and i've been wearing them non-stop ever

164
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,800
since i've gotten them but um this is

165
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,680
what it looks like the jeans i kind of

166
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,680
love this

167
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,000
okay so now i'm gonna try on this top

168
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,800
and this is the lovers thief top and i

169
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,280
got it in black

170
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,479
and it's just like a basic black crop

171
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,000
top with buttons

172
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,360
but i need a few basics for the winter

173
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,639
because you know how winter is all for

174
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,199
layering so i got this

175
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,800
uh let's try it on oh my god i love the

176
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,000
fit of this top i was scared it was

177
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,120
gonna be too cropped but

178
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,639
this what um oh you know in bahras this

179
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,440
is really embarrassing

180
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,440
anyways it's like the perfect crop so it

181
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,160
cuts off right around the waist area at

182
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,400
least for me

183
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,600
so it looks so flattering it has a bunch

184
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,000
of buttons i think i would like it

185
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,440
better

186
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,199
if it were like unbuttoned a little bit

187
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,479
just so it doesn't look like i'm choking

188
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,560
maybe like three buttons a little

189
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,080
scandalous

190
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,919
okay i like that a lot better this

191
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,400
material again is really thick such good

192
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,320
quality

193
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,160
i really love this this is such a good

194
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,479
basic top next i want to show you all

195
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,479
this

196
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,840
coat that i got or jacket what's the

197
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,600
difference between a coat and a jacket

198
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,440
is that a stupid question i don't know i

199
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,280
live in texas but you know

200
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,199
it's winter so we need jackets and coats

201
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,960
to keep you warm so i got this jacket

202
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,639
right here i got this in a size 2. i

203
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,160
wanted it a little bit bigger than my

204
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,199
normal size oh this is so

205
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,280
cute oh i feel bougie so what this is

206
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,960
the jacket it just has really neutral

207
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,360
colors it's a bunch of shades of brown

208
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,800
and then

209
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,800
some white in there and it's a nice

210
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,479
gingham pattern can you tell i

211
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,240
love that pattern it's a really thick

212
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,039
kind of like fuzzy coat i don't know if

213
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,080
you can see

214
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:14,240
the texture but it's really nice

215
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,000
again super thick this is like thick

216
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,960
like thick with like maybe like five c's

217
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,280
like this is

218
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,479
she's thick and it just looks like this

219
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,160
looks really good with

220
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,759
blue denim again because the colors are

221
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,759
so neutral it'll go with

222
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,520
essentially any color and they have this

223
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,600
jacket and a few more colors so you can

224
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,280
also pick it up in like a darker variety

225
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,039
of these shades but i personally like

226
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,199
really light colors so i got this one

227
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,400
it is a little crop but it works for me

228
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,400
because i'm five two

229
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,840
so short so like this is like normal

230
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,520
fitting on me but i'm assuming if you

231
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,639
were taller it would be more cropped

232
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,919
and it has pockets hello pockets just

233
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,400
like everything better so anything with

234
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,960
pockets

235
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,840
just like thumbs up but yes i will be

236
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,759
wearing this

237
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,759
coat a lot this winter okay and then i

238
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,880
got this top oh my freaking god i cannot

239
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,800
emphasize how

240
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,240
soft this is it literally feels like

241
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,440
what i would envision a cloud to feel

242
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,199
like even though we can't touch them

243
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,880
if you could touch clouds i feel like it

244
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,759
would be this texture

245
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,840
it's just so soft it's just a white

246
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,720
ribbed kind of sweater top wow this

247
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,080
is so comfortable i'm never taking this

248
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,840
off this is so comfortable

249
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,199
and it is like a really nice clean

250
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,680
bright white it looks like i'm wearing

251
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,840
snow

252
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,440
it is so soft young and it's so

253
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,800
form-fitting like and it just hugs your

254
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,080
curves correctly and it really just

255
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,680
flatters your figure

256
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,280
i have a little bit of the buttons

257
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,919
unbuttoned again trying to be a little

258
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,960
scandalous

259
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,880
this is just what it looks like it's

260
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,440
just another basic top again perfect for

261
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,080
layering

262
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,199
okay moving on i got this pair of pants

263
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,520
it's pink

264
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,560
again a checkerboard gingham pattern are

265
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,800
we surprised

266
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,639
no i will say this is a little bit of a

267
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,720
thinner material but i

268
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,080
feel like if you layer properly and wear

269
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,080
coat and everything this will still be

270
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,960
good for the winter okay let's try this

271
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,479
on okay so these are the pants as you

272
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,479
can see they fit me like

273
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,560
snuggly i feel like wearing these with

274
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,680
like black boots or even white boots

275
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,280
would be really pretty

276
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,199
like just boots in general i think pants

277
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,400
and boots is such an iconic combo and as

278
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,240
i mentioned i'm five two so i have

279
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,000
pretty freaking stubby short legs

280
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,680
so pants were a little long on me so all

281
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,879
i did was fold it over wow these pants

282
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,720
are so comfortable

283
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,720
i have no pants that are pink so i'm

284
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,919
really excited to style these honestly i

285
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,280
feel like this looks good together just

286
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,639
because there's like white in the pants

287
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,319
and then the white matches the white in

288
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,400
the top

289
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,160
an outfit okay and here is the last

290
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,560
thing i'm gonna show y'all it is another

291
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,599
jacket and this is a corduroy jacket so

292
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,520
and it buttons down

293
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,960
it's this nice like blushy pink color

294
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,039
it's more on the mauve side and it's a

295
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,840
little muted so i would consider this

296
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,919
more neutral

297
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,919
and this is just what it looks like i

298
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,159
got it in a size zero but i kind of wish

299
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,159
i

300
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,599
sized up like one more just so it'll be

301
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,039
a little bit more oversized

302
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,719
but i honestly don't mind this it's

303
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,479
still a really nice fit it is really

304
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,320
loose so it has a little bit of an

305
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,000
oversized feel i'm excited to style this

306
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,440
i feel like wearing this with a skirt

307
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,720
would be really cool too but honestly it

308
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,399
doesn't look too bad on these pants

309
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,680
because it's like corduroy material i

310
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,120
feel like this will definitely keep you

311
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,640
warm i'm honestly sweating right now

312
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,480
because it is not cold right now in

313
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,320
lubbock texas it's like 70 degrees this

314
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,240
jacket is making me sweat

315
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,640
but i will be wearing that when it does

316
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,640

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,560
