00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,440
hi friends

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,440
so this video is actually supposed to be

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,120
an entire portion in my last video which

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,240
is my quarantine glow up transformation

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,840
if you haven't seen it go ahead and

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,120
watch it but this portion of the video

7
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,040
actually had enough footage for me to

8
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,039
make a completely separate video so here

9
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,720
it is enjoy so here i have a variety of

10
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,400
different foundations that i purchased

11
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,800
when i thought i was a freaking makeup

12
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,560
guru

13
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,800
yeah that used to be me guys that used

14
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,400
to be what this channel was

15
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,640
these are definitely expired already and

16
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,880
i don't think any of these match me

17
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,640
so also you all know how i tanned for

18
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,320
this transformation well it's been like

19
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,160
three weeks since i tanned so i'm kind

20
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,719
of pale again so that's cute but

21
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,920
whatever

22
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,239
um this is definitely too dark and these

23
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,480
are all

24
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:48,640
too dark i'm pale damn it um

25
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,879
i have some lighter foundations but i

26
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,850
know those have mold in them i just i

27
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,399
know it um

28
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:58,239
[Music]

29
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:01,280
this is my favorite foundation so maybe

30
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:03,280
i don't know why i'm smelling it okay ew

31
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,519
it's like crusty because of like the

32
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,360
residue on the spout thingy like it

33
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:11,360
crusted up

34
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:14,000
oh freak i forgot a step damn it

35
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,720
so i have a very oily face it's very

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,360
oily it's

37
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,960
disgusting you could fry a freaking egg

38
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,479
on my face with the amount of oil that

39
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,240
it produces so i learned this from

40
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,759
another youtuber jackie i know

41
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,200
oh my god there's dust on this too

42
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,720
disgusting i used to watch her really

43
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,680
religiously when i was really into the

44
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,479
beauty community

45
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,000
but now it's low-key in shambles she

46
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,159
would always talk about this trick where

47
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,360
you put translucent powder on and you

48
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,280
set your

49
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,880
what is this called primer i'm such a

50
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,720
beauty guru anyway you would set your

51
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,240
primer with like translucent setting

52
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,280
powder in like the places that you get

53
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,439
oily so i get really oily

54
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,880

55
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,680

114
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,840
scar that i created on my face when i

115
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,439
was one years old

116
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,400
time to blend it out ew i saw myself in

117
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:58,239
the viewfinder and

118
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:01,120
my face when i blend out she's ugly

119
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,720
oh my god oh my gosh i forgot how good

120
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,040
concealer is what the heck

121
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,239
i look so awake right now and it's crazy

122
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,439
because i don't even know why i have

123
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,840
bags under my eyes because i'm like a

124
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,360
grandma and i go to bed at like 9 30 p.m

125
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,519
i get eight hours of sleep every night

126
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,120
but for some reason these bags decided

127
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,560
to show up on my face

128
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,840
love that basically what i'm getting

129
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,600
from this is that i need to start

130
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,040
wearing makeup again because this is fun

131
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,040
what the heck and the thing is i used to

132
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,800
be so good at makeup i would do

133
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,240
eye shadow looks that look like they

134
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,840
were done by okay maybe i'm giving

135
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,560
myself way too much credit but from what

136
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,720
i remember

137
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,479
i think i was pretty good at makeup told

138
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,080
me to do my own horn and now however

139
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,080
comma i do not possess those skills

140
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,560
i'm gonna try to like pat that into my

141
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,240
face my face looks like it doesn't have

142
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,240
any blemishes on it that's crazy

143
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,199
i'm gonna put some blush on because i

144
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,479
freaking love blush haven't been able to

145
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,720
wear it as of recently

146
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,720
because corona has led us all to wear

147
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,800
masks all the time so what is the point

148
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,759
of wearing my beautiful glossier cloud

149
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,280
paint i watched this

150
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,199
youtube video the other day it was so

151
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,000
random because i have been watching

152
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,360
stephanie sue

153
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,120
so religiously so like all my

154
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,520
recommendations is all stephanie sue and

155
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,360
like some bts and some like twice videos

156
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,720
and then there was this one makeup video

157
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,160
it was like talking about placement of

158
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,600
your blush and i always put my blush

159
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,280
here on my cheeks but i have a very

160
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,039
round face so that's probably

161
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,320
not the most optimal way of putting on

162
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,120
my blush because it probably makes the

163
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,199
face look rounder

164
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,680
person in the video said to like place

165
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,680
it on like your cheekbones so it'll like

166
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,919
snatch your face and make it look more

167
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,520
like angular and structured you put it

168
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,759
like right here like where

169
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,639
you typically put highlight she like

170
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,800
blended it out

171
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,639
to like the contours of her face but i

172
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,320
just i'm the type of person that just

173
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,160
really likes putting blush like

174
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,919
everywhere so this is probably going to

175
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,680
end up on the rest of my face but right

176
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,639
now we're going to try the whole angular

177
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,160
type of vibe see it already ended up

178
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,000
like on my under eye i just can't help

179
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,520
it it's in my nature to put blush

180
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,560
everywhere does that look any different

181
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:58,639
does my face look lifted

182
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:01,440
probably not definitely put too much

183
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,919
oh my gosh low-key freaking out oh my

184
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,600
gosh

185
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,639
now i'm gonna put it on my nose because

186
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,400
i freaking love that look

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,479
lipsticks and stuff like that like i'd

246
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,919
buy them but i realized like i just

247
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,839
don't like the way that they look on my

248
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,560
lips i'm just gonna add a little bit of

249
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,560
lip gloss

250
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,360
yay oh my gosh i have a full face of

251
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,760
makeup on i did not put on lashes

252
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,640
however come on i did not put on lashes

253
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,320
because i don't know

254
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,800
if it's like my eye shape or i'm really

255
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,560
just uncoordinated but i cannot

256
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,959
put lashes on my eyes they don't look

257
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,200
good

258
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,800
i just don't think like they fit my eye

259
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,720
shape i'm just really unskilled in the

260
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,240
area of putting on false lashes so i've

261
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,320
never been able to live out my dream of

262
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,000
