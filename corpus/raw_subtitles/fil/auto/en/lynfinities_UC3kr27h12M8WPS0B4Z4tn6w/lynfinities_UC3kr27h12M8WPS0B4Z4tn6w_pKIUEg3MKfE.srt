00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,639
hey everybody

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,519
it's lynn for today's video i wanted to

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,880
get a little serious and this is going

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,759
to be part one

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,600
of five of a new series that i am

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:21,199
starting on my channel

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:24,080
that explores and reflects my experience

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,960
growing up specifically growing up asian

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,680
american

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,000
growing up in the philippines growing up

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,720
as

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,519
a second culture kid growing up as an

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,640
immigrant

15
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:37,680
and growing up with a single mother and

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:41,120
i feel very strongly about these topics

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,600
because i as a teacher

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,360
know that there are kids all over the

19
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,960
world and kids that i

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,960
teach who may experience some of the

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,160
things that i have experienced

22
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:57,199
and as somebody who is

23
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,000
part of our district's middle school

24
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,199
ethnic studies

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,479
committee i feel very empowered

26
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,199
in making this series on my channel to

27
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,280
perhaps

28
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,640
share with the world and maybe share

29
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,960
with my kids

30
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,680
the experiences that i have had to go

31
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,640
through

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,560
to be who i am today because without

33
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,159
those experiences and without the people

34
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,360
who have supported me throughout

35
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,799
the entire time then i

36
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:29,680
would not be here today so

37
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,159
today's video is going to primarily talk

38
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,560
about

39
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,439
what it's like growing up asian american

40
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,520
and before

41
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,600
we dive a little bit deeper here are

42
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,680
some details that you should know

43
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:44,640
i was born in the philippines on july 14

44
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,520
1992 specifically in pasay city

45
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,320
philippines

46
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,040
and i moved to america with my mom when

47
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,479
i was

48
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:55,360
eight and i actually turned nine here

49
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,320
we ended up moving to daly city

50
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,200
california

51
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,840
my aunt vilma was actually very kind

52
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,119
enough

53
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:06,399
to let us in her home and my mom and i

54
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:09,440
shared a one bedroom with

55
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:13,200
my cousin ie and in the other two rooms

56
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:16,319
were my aunt and her husband as well as

57
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,640
my cousins i distinctly remember that on

58
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:22,560
the very first night that we arrived

59
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,080
here that i was crying to my mom

60
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,720
begging her to go back to the

61
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:30,000
philippines because the reality

62
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,400
just hit me and the reality consisted

63
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,319
of the fact that i'm gonna be going to

64
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,160
school with people that i don't know and

65
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,200
i'm gonna be starting a life

66
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,640
in a place and in a culture that i know

67
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,519
nothing about

68
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,280
and to be fair my mom tried to console

69
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,040
me but at the same time she can't really

70
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,080
do anything about it because

71
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,040
plane tickets are expensive and i just

72
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,160
remember

73
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,920
her consoling me and hugging me and

74
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,920
ensuring me that everything was gonna be

75
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,080
okay this would also be a good time to

76
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,680
let you know that the reason why my mom

77
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,879
and i moved to the us

78
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,480
is because her and my dad decided to get

79
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,040
separated and later on

80
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,840
they got divorced so then fast forward a

81
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,959
couple months

82
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,440
to me going to my very first american

83
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,000
school

84
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,200
in the fifth grade and at first i was

85
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,560
very shy because

86
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,120
i didn't really want to speak out loud

87
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,040
because

88
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,239
i was scared that people would make fun

89
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,640
of me and

90
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,159
it turns out that i was scared for a

91
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,480
reason because when i did

92
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,840
finally open my mouth to speak i had a

93
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,040
very thick filipino

94
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:38,000
accent and some of the kids

95
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,400
in the class were making fun of me not

96
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,239
only

97
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,959
in the classroom which by the way my

98
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,720
teacher to her credit nipped in the bud

99
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,080
but she couldn't do anything while we

100
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,640
were at recess and

101
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,040
at that time it was one of those really

102
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,720
really bad and traumatic experiences

103
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,720
because i was bullied a lot

104
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,720
not only because of the way that i spoke

105
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,879
but because of the way that i dressed

106
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,760
and because of the way that i presented

107
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,799
myself

108
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,200
but i just remember that there were a

109
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,959
few

110
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:10,319
girls who were kind enough to

111
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,400
talk to me during recess and i

112
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,319
specifically remember i had one friend

113
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,280
her name was nicole v

114
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,400
and she was one of my first friends here

115
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,880
in america and

116
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,000
she basically taught me the pledge of

117
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,919
allegiance because

118
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,040
back then that was something that we had

119
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,360
to recite

120
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,120
every single day before class started

121
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,080
but despite the fact that i was getting

122
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,919
bullied on

123
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:36,960
the daily i ended up actually excelling

124
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:39,759
in my academics because i kept trying

125
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,000
and i didn't have all of these friends

126
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:45,919
to distract me from my work

127
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,800
i remember my cubby in my little

128
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,520
table used to be the cleanest and the

129
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,360
neatest

130
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,639
and i thought that that was a telltale

131
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,520
sign of who

132
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,160
i would become today in addition to that

133
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,280
i also

134
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,680
read a lot i turned to books

135
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,639
and the characters in those books became

136
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,440
my friends

137
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,759
and i ended up reading a whole bunch of

138
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,639
a series of unfortunate events

139
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,800
matilda i ended up reading a few of the

140
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,199
harry potter books granted i didn't know

141
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,720
that

142
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:19,280
they were in a series before and i just

143
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,840
remember going to the library which was

144
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,320
about

145
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,039
a two to three block walk away from my

146
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,440
house

147
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,520
and i would get books about witches and

148
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,960
aliens and cookbooks and

149
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,160
goosebumps and a whole plethora of books

150
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,520
because i just wanted

151
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,880
to escape from my reality i actually

152
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,800
didn't tell anybody

153
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,639
about any of the bullying that happened

154
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,800
to me in the fifth grade because i

155
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,840
didn't want to be a burden to my mom

156
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,280
or to my aunt or to my uncle or to

157
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,160
anybody else in my family

158
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,440
because i know that my mom was already

159
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,320
having a hard time because

160
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,360
she literally had to uproot herself and

161
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,880
her daughter

162
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:01,520
from the philippines travel across

163
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,960
oceans to come to california and to

164
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,199
start a new life

165
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,319
and i can only imagine what that was

166
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,039
like for her

167
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,840
and i remember her telling me this one

168
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,280
thing that

169
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:16,639
sticks to me to this day and that is

170
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:19,600
it's better that you are going through

171
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,440
these experiences now as a young person

172
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,400
because then it will make you a stronger

173
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,759
adult

174
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:28,639
and i completely agree with that now

175
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,199
but back in the day i was like girl you

176
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,479
crazy

177
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:34,639
i do not want to experience these but

178
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,960
i needed to be strong for her i needed

179
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:40,560
to show her that i am as resilient

180
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:43,520
as possible because there were nights

181
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,039
when i would actually hear her crying

182
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,600
herself to sleep

183
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,240
and a lot of the times i would just

184
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,240
pretend

185
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,120
that i didn't hear her because i didn't

186
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:56,319
want her to think that i could hear her

187
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:59,599
and that was to this day one of those

188
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,840
experiences that i will never forget and

189
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,240
then after i graduated fifth grade i

190
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,880
went

191
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,080
to middle school sixth grade for about

192
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,919
two months

193
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:12,000
in daly city before moving to

194
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,720
southern california san diego

195
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,440
specifically chula vista california

196
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,240
where my aunt ended up getting a really

197
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,639
big house

198
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,280
and in that house i shared a room with

199
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,759
my mom

200
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:26,080
and my cousin i had his own room which

201
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,120
was super fun and i was really happy

202
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,120
that he got that

203
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,960
and in san diego at least at the time

204
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,520
sixth grade was still part of elementary

205
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,840
school

206
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,440
so i pretty much graduated elementary

207
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,000
twice my experience

208
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,919
as a sixth grader and part of seventh

209
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,440
grade in san diego

210
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:46,319
were the complete 180 of my experience

211
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,360
in daly city granted the school that i

212
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,479
went to

213
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,319
in san diego was brand new

214
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,560
therefore we were the first batch of the

215
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,520
sixth graders to graduate

216
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,720
but despite that in my class

217
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,319
specifically

218
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,520
i had a ton of friends i made a ton of

219
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,599
friends we were all

220
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,759
hanging out together during recess and

221
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,479
during lunch we all had a little lunch

222
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,440
spot

223
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,759
and we were all just really good friends

224
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,680
and

225
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:17,440
we didn't have any difficulty

226
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,960
hanging out with different people

227
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,400
because everyone

228
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,639
was new and i would really like to give

229
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,120
a shout out to my sixth grade best

230
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,039
friend

231
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,400
andrea she goes by drea now because

232
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:31,520
she's cool like that

233
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,760
and we are actually still friends today

234
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,320
we've kept in touch in spite of the fact

235
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:39,039
that i ended up moving back to daly city

236
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,000
and we have remained friends and for a

237
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,240
while there when

238
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,080
she still lived in socal i would visit

239
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,880
her we would watch kpop concerts

240
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,600
together

241
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,240
and we would go to disneyland and just

242
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,000
having her

243
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,720
in my life really made my experience

244
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,560
in san diego so much better and what i

245
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,200
really liked the most about my

246
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,600
experience living in san diego is that

247
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,839
i got to be a part of my favorite

248
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,560
teachers class miss higdon

249
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,000
she to me is one of the reasons why i

250
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,040
became a teacher because

251
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,920
she empowered me she made

252
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,560
me feel like i was accepted and most

253
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,120
importantly

254
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,399
she challenged me and it was actually in

255
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,880
the sixth grade

256
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:26,240
when i won my very first speech contest

257
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:29,839
and this is coming from somebody who

258
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:33,040
couldn't even speak english fluently

259
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,440
or well literally a year a year and a

260
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,000
half

261
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,040
prior and since i won the school-wide

262
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,440
speech contest

263
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,640
i ended up going to the district-wide

264
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,880
competition

265
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:47,440
and i unfortunately didn't win that one

266
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,120
but i just remember seeing all these

267
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,160
kids from all these different schools

268
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,519
within the district

269
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:56,560
and them reciting their speeches

270
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:59,680
and it sounding amazing and

271
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:02,160
these are the kids who have faced

272
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,000
many challenges the topic of the speech

273
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,959
is what is the most important thing in

274
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,440
your life

275
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,120
and everyone had a plethora of different

276
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,680
answers and i remember this girl who i

277
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,680
think won

278
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,000
second place and her speech was all

279
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,959
about pictures being the most important

280
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,200
thing in her life

281
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,480
because about a month before the speech

282
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,600
writing contest

283
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,760
happened she and her family actually

284
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,800
lost her house to a fire and one of the

285
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,079
first things that her

286
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:30,399
mom took from their burning house

287
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,279
were pictures and clearly that struck a

288
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,360
chord with me and that

289
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,560
impacted me to this day because i

290
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,440
remember it

291
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,440
so distinctly and it was great and if

292
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,839
you were wondering what my answer was

293
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,160
and

294
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,640
as cliche as it sounds because i am now

295
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:48,320
an educator and a teacher myself

296
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:50,240
my answer was school education was the

297
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,399
most important thing in my life and

298
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,160
my reason then and my reason now is

299
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,040
pretty much the same thing and

300
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,560
that is because i value it more than

301
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,560
anything in the world because it is

302
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,200
something that no one else can take away

303
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,240
from me

304
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,200
and it is something that i know i can

305
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,880
work on

306
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:11,760
to make myself and my life better

307
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,120
so that's really dramatic but clearly i

308
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,320
have picked the right path for me

309
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,120
because to this day

310
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,680
i am a teacher and i have no plans of

311
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,399
changing careers anytime soon or any

312
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,839
time

313
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:26,720
at all and all of that i want to say

314
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,200
is because miss higdon never gave up on

315
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,640
me

316
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:33,040
she always made sure that i was doing

317
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,760
what i was supposed to be doing and that

318
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,720
she

319
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,000
challenged me to do better whenever i

320
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,399
felt like giving up

321
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,800
she would always tell me that i can do

322
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,399
it and as a matter of fact it was also

323
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,440
in the sixth grade that i got

324
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:50,800
a spirit award and the spirit award

325
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,480
is called perseverance and at first

326
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,240
i was actually getting a little salty

327
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,760
because every other one of my friends

328
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,440
were getting the spirit awards at the

329
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,839
end of each month and i didn't

330
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,880
and the very last spirit award was

331
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,760
perseverance

332
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,240
and she said that that was on purpose

333
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,800
because

334
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,079
she knew that at the end of it all that

335
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,079
i would persevere

336
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,519
and then after living in san diego for a

337
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,920
little bit my mom and i

338
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,880
ended up moving back to daly city

339
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,320
because she

340
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,800
actually found a job in san francisco

341
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,240
and we ended up staying at my cousin's

342
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,360
house my atomolec

343
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,720
and she is amazing she and i are still

344
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,600
very close to this day

345
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,480
and i am very close with her two

346
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,040
daughters

347
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,079
kaylee and crystal and they are actually

348
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,560
the ones who

349
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,200
painted those paintings in the back

350
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,760
there

351
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,639
and we have stayed very close all

352
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,240
throughout

353
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,720
and i remember when i moved back to daly

354
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,720
city

355
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,680
i was kind of dreading it because it

356
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:52,000
wasn't a fun experience the first time

357
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,279
but i thought to myself hey it's going

358
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,519
to be a new school

359
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,760
you're going to be fine and for the most

360
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,800
part it was fun and fine

361
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,200
but then again middle school is or at

362
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,480
least

363
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:08,079
was full of kids who were catty

364
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:10,320
and who just wanted to be cool

365
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,120
and i also wanted to be cool like

366
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,279
everyone else

367
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,040
i mean as a middle schooler i think that

368
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:18,639
was everyone's goal

369
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:22,800
but i realized too upon

370
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:25,440
moving back to daly city that i

371
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,480
needed to make some changes about myself

372
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,839
i wanted to be

373
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,519
cool i wanted to reinvent who i was

374
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,360
and if i'm being completely honest with

375
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,680
you it was a complete fail

376
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,480
because despite the fact that i tried to

377
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,320
assimilate

378
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:43,680
to the usual american societal norms

379
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:47,199
and the usual american school norms

380
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:49,760
i was still and i want to

381
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,399
say to this day still not the coolest

382
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,920
person

383
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:56,079
in the planet and i just remember i was

384
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,040
wearing skechers while everyone else

385
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:00,079
were wearing their

386
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,800
air force ones and i remember wearing my

387
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,959
clothes

388
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,240
multiple times a week because hello we

389
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,839
had a washer and dryer

390
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,360
you can just wash your clothes but

391
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,120
apparently there is an

392
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,920
unspoken rule in middle school that you

393
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,880
should not be an outfit repeater

394
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,399
and granted now as a teacher in middle

395
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,800
school i feel like that

396
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,839
stuff doesn't exist or if it does it

397
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,600
doesn't exist

398
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:26,639
that much in 2020 i can honestly say

399
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:29,199
that kids are not as catty kids

400
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,760
are actually very accepting of others

401
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,199
and

402
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:35,760
i want to say that a lot of them tend

403
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,720
to stand up for what is right and what

404
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,040
is just

405
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,120
and i want to give credit to the fact

406
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,160
that despite the fact that kids are on

407
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,360
their screens

408
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,720
for hours and hours and hours a day it

409
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,680
is through those screens that they are

410
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,160
able to get

411
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,720
information and that they are able to

412
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:56,399
see representation of themselves

413
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:58,320
on social media on tv shows on movies

414
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,320
and i feel like they feel a little bit

415
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,959
more empowered because back in the day

416
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,560
when i was in middle school anything

417
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,440
that i watched on tv

418
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,360
had zero asian representation i was

419
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,880
watching one tree hill dawson's creek

420
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,680
gossip girl

421
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,880
even law order svu these are shows that

422
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,000
only primarily

423
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:21,360
featured white people and nowadays kids

424
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,600
have people to look up to that are

425
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:27,839
people of color or that are part of the

426
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:30,880
lgbtqia plus community or non-binary

427
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,959
and now because the internet exists the

428
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,800
world is their oyster they can be

429
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:37,600
watching k-pop videos

430
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,399
one day and then watch mukbang videos

431
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,440
another day

432
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:44,079
and watch vloggers another day

433
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,519
right like all of this are things that

434
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,560
used to not exist

435
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:51,199
when i was growing up in america and

436
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,199
it was a culture shock for me coming

437
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:56,000
from the philippines where it was

438
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,880
primarily conservative not necessarily

439
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,320
politically

440
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:02,560
but more so values wise

441
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,480
and despite the fact that i did have

442
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:07,279
some negative experiences

443
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,240
in the united states a i didn't let it

444
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:12,000
deter me

445
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:15,360
from pursuing the goals that i had and b

446
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,920
it actually liberated me from some of

447
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,440
the more

448
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,399
restricting and conservative ideals and

449
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,199
values

450
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,639
that limited people and that forced

451
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:27,519
people to conform

452
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:29,440
when in reality you should be liberated

453
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:32,160
from all forms of oppression

454
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,959
granted america still perpetuates

455
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,279
oppression

456
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:39,279
and flat out murders of people of color

457
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,480
especially black people hashtag black

458
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,360
lives matter

459
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,120
but i do want to say that my experience

460
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,480
in america really helped me

461
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:51,440
decolonize my mind especially

462
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,120
when i ended up going to college at san

463
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,000
francisco state where it was a

464
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,920
requirement

465
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,839
to take ethnic studies classes and i

466
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,680
liked it so much that i only needed two

467
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,000
classes to get a minor

468
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,040
in ethnic studies specifically asian

469
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,559
american studies

470
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,319
but i didn't pursue it because i didn't

471
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,079
want to stay an extra semester i can

472
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,199
honestly say that all of these

473
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,360
experiences

474
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,720
that i had growing up as an asian

475
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,280
american the good

476
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,319
the bad the ugly the valuable the

477
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,199
important

478
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:21,039
all of these experiences made me who i

479
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,280
am today and in spite of the fact that

480
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:26,079
there were some negative experiences

481
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,280
i still came out of it alive and kicking

482
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,520
and thriving

483
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,080
and ready to take on the world and now

484
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,720
my life has come full circle because now

485
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,440
as an adult i am an educator i am a

486
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,720
teacher

487
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:41,919
and i strive every single day to ensure

488
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,200
that i am providing a safe place for my

489
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,440
students to be

490
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,320
who they are and who they truly are on

491
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,120
the inside

492
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,000
and for them to not be afraid to show

493
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,520
who they are

494
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,600
and to share their experiences with me

495
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,799
and with their classmates because at the

496
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,440
end of the day all

497
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,320
everyone wants is to feel a sense of

498
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,640
