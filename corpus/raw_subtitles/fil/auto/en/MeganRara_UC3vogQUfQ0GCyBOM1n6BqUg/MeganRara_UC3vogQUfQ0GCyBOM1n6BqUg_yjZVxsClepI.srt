81
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,760
once i transferred to a university i

82
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,280
took school more seriously

83
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:18,959
and i really re-evaluated

84
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,400
myself and my time i committed my time

85
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,000
to school

86
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:27,360
and um really improved my

87
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,799
time management um when i transferred so

88
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,360
i'm going to give you guys a couple of

89
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,159
tips

90
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,080

92
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,360
in college so the number one tip that i

93
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,959
have for you is

94
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,120
just to prioritize school um

95
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,640
i know that it's really hard to say no

96
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,040
to hanging out with your friends and

97
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,200
family i've had to say no

98
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,799
over the past two years i've had to say

99
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,879
no to hanging out with friends

100
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,840
to going to family events but i know

101
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,319
it's worth it

102
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,519
when you have that goal when you have a

103
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,680
goal in mind

104
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,720
stick to it be disciplined if it's

105
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,599
something that you really

106
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,120
want i know that sacrificing time with

107
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,640
friends and family and all those

108
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,080
important events um you know sometimes

109
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,640
you have to sacrifice

110
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,680
time to get the results that you want

111
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,599
the second tip

112
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,280
that i have for anyone that is

113
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,639
struggling in college

114
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,280
is to be extremely organized i noticed

115
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,639
that once i started writing everything

116
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,720
down in my planner

117
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,000
even reading assignments stuff that i

118
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,680
didn't have to turn in

119
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,160
stuff that i had to do for the day for

120
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,639
the week write everything down just so

121
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,520
you know exactly what you need to do

122
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,639
when it's due deadlines that you want to

123
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,560
give yourself

124
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,199
for reading assignments and write

125
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,720
everything down it will make everything

126
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,320
so much easier and seamless in college

127
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,919
so the third tip that i have for you

128
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,240
guys is sit

129
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,800
in the front in the classes that you

130
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,440
think you're struggling in i

131
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,520
took business calculus twice and i

132
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,479
didn't do well both times

133
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,960
i'm so sorry about the noise the third

134
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,120
time

135
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,199
i sat in the front i made sure i paid

136
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,560
attention came early to class

137
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:13,360
asked questions whenever i was confused

138
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,440
um that's another thing sit in the front

139
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,160
and don't be shy to ask questions

140
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,360
so that really helped me in my class i

141
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,199
have a very

142
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,400
short attention span so if i'm not

143
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,880
sitting in the front

144
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,840
i will go on my phone i will doodle on

145
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,919
my notebook

146
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,880
i know that it's really tempting to just

147
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,120
sit in the back

148
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,240
and chill on your phone but if you

149
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,280
really want to

150
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,039
excel in a class and stay focused i

151
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,960
advise you to

152
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,320
sit in the front and don't be afraid to

153
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,039
ask questions

154
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,840
when you're lost so the last and final

155
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,680
tip is to ask your professor questions

156
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,720
when you are struggling in the class

157
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,440
take time to go to their office hours

158
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,000
because most likely they're willing to

159
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,560
help you

160
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
willing to give you extra credit um i

161
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,840
know that when i was struggling

162
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
in the class i had constant

163
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:05,520
communication with my professor

164
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,600
and they remember that when they are

165
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,000
either going to bump your grade up or

166
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,919
not you want to have good communication

167
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,919
with your professors and build that good

168
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,840
relationship with them because

169
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,199
it will pay off in the end i just want

170
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,520
to thank you guys so much

171
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,520
