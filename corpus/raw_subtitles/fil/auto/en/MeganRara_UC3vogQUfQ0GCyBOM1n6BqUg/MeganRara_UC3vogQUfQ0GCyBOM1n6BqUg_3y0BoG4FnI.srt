1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:11,250
yeah I'm not gonna cry today I want to

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,320
talk about my college journey and

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:17,039
basically what I've been going through

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,449
for so long if you guys are fans let me

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,609
know in the comments below I actually

6
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:24,330
really like this shirt and it's a good

7
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:26,310
fit so Breaking Bad all the way but on

8
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,769
to the serious part of this video and

9
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:32,309
basically what I've been wanting to make

10
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:36,329
a video about is my college journey it

11
00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:39,530
has been such a long exhausting journey

12
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:42,780
I feel like I feel this way because I'm

13
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:44,850
comparing my timeline to other peoples

14
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:48,480
timelines and I'm just seeing other

15
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:51,750
people already in their career and it

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,460
just makes me sad because I have so many

17
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,879
passions outside of school and I just

18
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:59,039
want to start my career already but I'm

19
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,129
having a really hard time transferring

20
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,140
out of my Community College so I'm gonna

21
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:08,040
just go back from the beginning I

22
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,780
graduated high school in 2014 and my

23
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,000
grades in high school to be honest

24
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:16,590
weren't the best I really didn't care

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,340
about my grades and I applied to a

26
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:23,240
couple schools didn't get into a lot of

27
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:26,250
the schools that I wanted to go to so I

28
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,869
applied to see bu and if you guys don't

29
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,079
know it's California Baptist University

30
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:34,200
it's actually really easy University to

31
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:37,650
get into so I thought I wanted to go

32
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,380
there until I realized that the tuition

33
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:43,979
was way too high for the budget of my

34
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,299
dad and just my budget as well because I

35
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:47,820
knew those student loans would

36
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:50,070
eventually move on to me after I

37
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:54,780
graduated college so I took a semester

38
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:56,369
off because the deadline to register for

39
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,340
the community college that I wanted to

40
00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:02,399
go to was already over I thought I was

41
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:04,829
going to see bu but I was pretty

42
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,990
disappointed that I didn't get to start

43
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:09,050
college right away but it really wasn't

44
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,520
a big deal in the grand scheme hopefully

45
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:12,960
I'll have that same perspective on the

46
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,570
same situation that I

47
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,400
I am in right now I decided to go to a

48
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:21,270
community college in Orange County

49
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,770
starting spring 2015 and honestly I

50
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:25,350
didn't have a lot of guidance and I

51
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:27,270
didn't do a lot of research so I ended

52
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:29,970
up taking a couple classes that I didn't

53
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:31,800
need I think I took one journalism class

54
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:33,750
that didn't give me any transfer college

55
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,960
credit so I really messed up there and

56
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,840
the whole first year of college I just

57
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:43,590
didn't get good grades which set me back

58
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,720
so much I thought I wanted to be a

59
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:47,880
sociology major because I really liked

60
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,190
the sociology classes and I did fairly

61
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,180
well in them I thought I wanted to be a

62
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:54,720
psych major

63
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:57,960
but I'm just realizing how much school

64
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,560
that those two majors required I just

65
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:03,690
didn't want to do that and then I got

66
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,790
introduced to marketing by a couple of

67
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:09,660
my friends and my sister who is

68
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:11,910
marketing major she's in the fashion

69
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,950
industry now but just realizing that

70
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:16,530
marketing was so broad and I always knew

71
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:19,290
that I wanted to do something creative

72
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:21,840
I've always been a creative person so I

73
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:24,450
changed my major to business marketing a

74
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:28,320
year and a half into school I knew that

75
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:29,760
I wanted to transfer soon but my grades

76
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,880
just weren't good enough so I had to

77
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,070
keep taking classes to improve my GPA

78
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:38,880
but I was just having such a hard time

79
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:40,320
at school and didn't know why I think I

80
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,690
just wasn't putting enough time and

81
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:45,240
effort into school like I was supposed

82
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:46,680
to and I thought that the effort that I

83
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:50,610
was putting in was enough but it really

84
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:55,290
was it so fall 2018 comes around four

85
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:58,620
years later and I am actually no no its

86
00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:01,320
fall 2017 I'm applying for fall 2018 and

87
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:05,730
my parents wanted to go on a European

88
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:08,610
trip we did Italy and France which was

89
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:10,820
really fun but the only problem was it

90
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:14,250
was in the middle of the semester so I

91
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:16,109
pretty much I think I flunked one of my

92
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:20,129
classes and then

93
00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:21,959
I got C's in the rest of them and I'm

94
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:24,599
not blaming it on the Europe trip

95
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,520
because I decided to go and I wanted to

96
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:28,289
go with my family I think that sometimes

97
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,659
life just happens and I knew that I

98
00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:32,610
wasn't going to be able to do this trip

99
00:04:30,659 --> 00:04:35,849
later on if I don't go with my family

100
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:37,710
now and we had such a fun time I don't

101
00:04:35,849 --> 00:04:41,550
really regret going even though it set

102
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:45,180
me a year behind yeah so I just had to

103
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:47,370
wait so now I am applying for fall 2019

104
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,699
I got rejected by Cal State Long Beach

105
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:51,960
Cal State LA and then I got wait-listed

106
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:56,490
for Cal State Fullerton and Cal Poly

107
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:58,379
Pomona honestly when I saw that I was

108
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:02,520
rejected by two schools and wait-listed

109
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:06,150
by two I got really discouraged and I

110
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,710
feel like I don't know my creative

111
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:09,180
juices aren't flowing at the moment

112
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:11,279
there's so many things that I'm

113
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:15,449
passionate about I love yoga I love

114
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:18,659
helping other people I would love to do

115
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:21,330
social media marketing and for a

116
00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:23,490
sustainable fashion company those are

117
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:25,740
just some of my dreams and I just feel

118
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:30,629
like I am so out of touch with my

119
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:33,060
creative side and just feel out of touch

120
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:35,729
with myself just because I'm being so

121
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:39,089
hard on myself about school I'm getting

122
00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:41,279
emotional about it but I know that it's

123
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:43,699
gonna be okay because I'm only 23 years

124
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:47,159
old I mean in the grand scheme of things

125
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:49,020
it's not a big deal at all I'm so

126
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:51,360
grateful for the opportunity to go to

127
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:55,620
school because not a lot of people have

128
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,060
the opportunity and I don't know I'm

129
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,190
just being down on myself for some

130
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,110
reason talk about something uplifting so

131
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:03,690
this past weekend I stayed in LA with my

132
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:06,690
sister and on Saturday we got the

133
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:09,029
opportunity to volunteer for this

134
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:11,490
organization called Habitat for Humanity

135
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:14,400
so basically this organization helps

136
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:16,740
low-income families get a home and we

137
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,710
have the opportunity to help paint

138
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:21,360
houses for low-income families a lot of

139
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:22,230
these low-income families are actually

140
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,720
there that

141
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:26,700
a to help paint their own home which was

142
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,890
really cool we had the chance to talk to

143
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:31,020
one of the guys that was getting their

144
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:32,850
home through this organization they buy

145
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:35,490
their own home but I think they get some

146
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:37,950
help through the organization but he's

147
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:40,080
getting a home in Pasadena and they were

148
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:42,330
in LA but he was just volunteering for

149
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:46,440
the organization which was really good

150
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:48,570
and this opportunity just made me feel

151
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,190
so grateful for what I have and it

152
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:54,090
really opened up my eyes to the

153
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:56,160
opportunities that I have and I think

154
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:59,970
that it was such perfect timing because

155
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:04,830
all this school shenanigans has been on

156
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:06,240
my mind lately and yeah sometimes you

157
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:09,960
just got to take a breather and just

158
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:12,990
realize how grateful we should all be I

159
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:15,800
mean I always complain about living at

160
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:18,990
home but in reality I'm so lucky to have

161
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,880
parents that have allowed me to stay at

162
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:25,110
home for so long to save money to go to

163
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:26,700
school and actually you know go to

164
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:30,330
school for something that I really like

165
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:33,140
so I'm really grateful for that and I

166
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:36,090
know that I'm being hard on myself for

167
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:38,460
not finishing school in four years let

168
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:42,120
alone five or six and so many feelings

169
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:44,190
of I wish I tried harder in high school

170
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,800
I wish I tried harder my first year of

171
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:49,410
college so many feelings like that has

172
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,000
come up through my school journey but I

173
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:53,220
think it's just best to keep moving

174
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,490
forward and to find new ways to study

175
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:58,440
find new ways to get better grades I

176
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:00,360
feel like I'm finding new ways to become

177
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,800
a better student I feel like we've been

178
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,920
in school for so long but we were

179
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:07,950
actually never taught to properly study

180
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:09,810
and you know there are different study

181
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:14,730
methods for different types of people so

182
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:16,680
you know what even though this school

183
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:19,170
journey has been so frustrating for me

184
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,940
and so exhausting I feel like I'm

185
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:23,430
becoming a better person and learning

186
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:25,230
new things about myself that I wouldn't

187
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:28,110
have learned if my school journey was

188
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:32,090
easy so there are things to be grateful

189
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:34,890
about when it comes to being set back by

190
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:35,640
things that you see as failures but they

191
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,530
aren't failures

192
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,870
they're actually opportunities want to

193
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:42,330
end this video on a positive note and

194
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:45,000
give you guys some positivity when it

195
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:47,670
comes to school or just life in general

196
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,910
