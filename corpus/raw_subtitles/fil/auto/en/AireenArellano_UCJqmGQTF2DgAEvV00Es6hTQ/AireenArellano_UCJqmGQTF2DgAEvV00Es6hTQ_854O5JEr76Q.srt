12
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:35,399
video down below so you can check this

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,360
out after watching mine let's just let's

14
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,270
just get into it

15
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,579
I am Filipino American let me just look

16
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,730
this up real quick number one results on

17
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:46,620
Google first generation are Filipinos

18
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,750
who were born in the Philippines and

19
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,239
have migrated to the United States

20
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:54,120
second generation Filipino Americans are

21
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:57,780
born in America so by that definition I

22
00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:01,050
am second generation in 1973 my mom

23
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:04,350
immigrated from Manila Philippines to

24
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:06,930
Natchez Mississippi to work in a nursing

25
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:11,430
program so she came here on a work visa

26
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:14,220
then in 1974 my mom moved to Chicago to

27
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,799
reunite with her older sister my awesome

28
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:20,330
aunt who was already settled in so my

29
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:23,549
mom was just loving working in Chicago

30
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:25,830
until she got a broken heart she was

31
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:29,130
dating someone for a while and then they

32
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:31,950
broke up and then my mom came home to

33
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:34,320
the Philippines to surround herself with

34
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:37,020
family and just kind of heal from that

35
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,079
and that's where she met my dad the

36
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:43,970
whole cording to getting married thing

37
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:47,790
was such a crazy quick whirlwind because

38
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:49,950
they were married within months after

39
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,630
meeting each other it was definitely a

40
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,689
love at first sight thing they got

41
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:58,110
married in June 1981

42
00:01:54,689 --> 00:02:00,210
but guess what my mom had a job and the

43
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,939
life in Chicago so shortly thereafter

44
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,500
she had to go back home she wasn't going

45
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:06,299
on honeymoon she was going back home to

46
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,729
Chicago to work but not lose her work

47
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:13,060
visa and then she worked on getting my

48
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:15,910
dad over to Chicago the spouse visa my

49
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:19,990
would come home to the Philippines and

50
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:23,709
visit my dad whenever she could in 1983

51
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:27,550
in June that's when I was born but my

52
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:30,970
dad was now working in Saudi Arabia let

53
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:32,950
me give you some political background on

54
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:35,620
what was going on in the Philippines at

55
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:37,360
this time you can look up the history of

56
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,440
the Philippines of what was going on

57
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,480
I'll just give you a really quick

58
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,910
overview there was a lot of chaos with

59
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,220
the Marcos regime at that time I'm

60
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:47,769
calling it a regime because that's what

61
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:50,590
it was a lot of people who had the

62
00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:52,450
opportunity were just looking to get out

63
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,820
of there so my dad took the opportunity

64
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:58,269
to go work in Saudi Arabia just so he

65
00:02:54,820 --> 00:03:00,640
can get out of there so over the next

66
00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:04,120
three years my parents were keeping in

67
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:08,069
touch via mail and phone and my mom said

68
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:11,110
that the phone bill would go up to $500

69
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:14,350
$500 in the 80s I mean that's like crazy

70
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:17,769
now can you can someone figure out the

71
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:21,579
inflation on that like that is true love

72
00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:24,730
finally my mom became a US citizen and

73
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:27,820
she was able to petition my dad to come

74
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:32,010
over and that's exactly what happened

75
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:36,910
so my dad finally came over to the u.s.

76
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:38,769
Chicago Illinois in 1986 I was born in

77
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:40,989
the south west side of Chicago market

78
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:43,540
Park were you at and then the

79
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:46,470
neighborhood was turning there was more

80
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:49,450
gang presence violence happening my

81
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:52,690
parents found it necessary to move me

82
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:55,810
and my brother outside of Chicago and

83
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:57,670
into suburbia that's where we ended up

84
00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:00,400
in the southwest suburbs the first time

85
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:04,120
I felt different was pretty young I

86
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:07,000
loved Chicago my neighborhood was so

87
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:09,940
diverse that's where I saw that people

88
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,290
were just people and and that people

89
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:14,200
could look different they could have

90
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:17,380
light skin and dark skin and medium skin

91
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:20,140
and everything in between and I never

92
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:23,650
felt weird about that but it did happen

93
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:27,220
when our class was rehearsing for

94
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:29,530
religious ceremony of some sort I went

95
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:31,420
ooh a Catholic grade school a bunch of

96
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:33,760
us kids were standing around a couple of

97
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:36,040
these kids were saying stuff like yeah

98
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,660
look at this girl she's like Chinese so

99
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:41,050
they were like Chinese eyes and I was

100
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:43,360
like what is going on right now in that

101
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:45,970
moment is where I felt really different

102
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,760
there were other Asian kids in my class

103
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:51,010
so that was just really weird that they

104
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,930
were picking on me for that so yes that

105
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:56,710
was my first instance of feeling like oh

106
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:59,230
I guess I am different but so are you

107
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:01,690
you know what I mean so it's I think I

108
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:03,580
have some perspective now looking at

109
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:07,660
that like now I just see okay you kids

110
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:13,050
are just being dumb yeah yeah they're

111
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:16,780
both both I'm proud now growing up

112
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:19,300
Filipino American the move from a really

113
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:23,020
diverse neighborhood in Chicago I loved

114
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:26,770
my neighborhood I loved my school my

115
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:28,600
friends were all kinds of ethnicities I

116
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:32,470
really felt like it was this little

117
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:35,500
United Nations of people and then when

118
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:39,580
my parents moved me and my brother from

119
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:43,540
there to the southwest suburbs in 1992 I

120
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:48,490
was the only person of color in my

121
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:52,260
school and I think that really did a

122
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:56,950
number on my personality because I never

123
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:59,470
considered myself super shy until I

124
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:02,620
moved to the suburbs

125
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:07,630
imagine being not only the new girl but

126
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:12,000
also the only girl of color and an

127
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:12,000
otherwise very homogeneous environment

128
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:20,919
that was a really difficult time like I

129
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:24,250
left my really good friends and I didn't

130
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:29,160
know anybody in my neighborhood I didn't

131
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:32,470
know anybody in my class and people just

132
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:37,479
acted different it was like being thrown

133
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:38,830
in the deep end of an icy cold pool I

134
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:40,660
didn't know what to do in this new

135
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:42,610
environment so I just stayed quiet I

136
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:46,620
I need friends but I used that

137
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:50,910
opportunity to just envelop myself in

138
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:53,380
studies in reading and watching TV

139
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:55,330
because my parents were also very

140
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:57,460
protective I think it was kind of the

141
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:59,490
effect of coming from a bad neighborhood

142
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:02,800
they really wanted to make sure that

143
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:05,710
they had eyes on us at all times so for

144
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,420
a time I just kind of put away that side

145
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:09,580
of me which was really difficult because

146
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:11,710
like when you see my face like I can't

147
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:14,320
you can't hide who you are there wasn't

148
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:15,460
any real effort to take me in either the

149
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,070
new girl okay

150
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:21,190
cool you're over there all right welcome

151
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:23,260
to our class and we'll stay over here I

152
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:25,060
rejected it yeah I'll have to admit it's

153
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:30,360
hard for me to say out loud but yes I

154
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:34,480
did actively from grade school up until

155
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:37,600
my sophomore year of high school I just

156
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:40,480
didn't make any references to being

157
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,880
Filipino that's always fun stereotypes

158
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:45,310
are fun uh-huh thankfully I'm at a place

159
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:49,660
now there's more awareness of being

160
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:51,610
inclusive and encouragement of diversity

161
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,680
I've been watching a couple of these tag

162
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:56,740
videos and some of the things that have

163
00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:00,130
come up that I agree with are the model

164
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:03,850
Asian stereotype you know it being

165
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:05,830
studious and being super smart luckily

166
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:09,070
because I didn't have any friends I

167
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:11,680
stayed inside and studied all day and

168
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:13,930
night so that seriously though yeah

169
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,270
there was some frustration that was a

170
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:19,570
struggle for me I had to work three

171
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:22,480
times as hard to be in honors classes

172
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:26,560
and I was because of that pressure I've

173
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:28,300
definitely had some bullying moments so

174
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,349
in my own neighborhood I have a home

175
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:34,919
with my husband and my dog your standard

176
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:37,660
suburban living I was walking outside

177
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:40,330
one day and then there was a car that

178
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:43,770
drove by with a bunch of dumb kids

179
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:48,300
inside and then they started yelling

180
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:52,600
stereotypical really derogatory

181
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:54,490
ching-chong sounds out of their car I

182
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,070
feel weird even just saying that

183
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:58,870
it's so disrespectful I was the only one

184
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:02,740
outside and they were definitely aiming

185
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:06,220
that at me and I didn't know what to say

186
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:08,380
like and then I started just hating my

187
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,150
neighborhood after that and hating

188
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:12,430
everyone after that and that was just

189
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:15,790
one instance of bullying I can't imagine

190
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:17,740
people who deal with that on a regular

191
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:19,990
basis and how they feel about themselves

192
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:21,670
and other people and their environments

193
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:23,740
I remember telling my husband like you

194
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:24,940
know this neighborhood sucks like we got

195
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,830
to move out of here there's no diversity

196
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:30,730
it's definitely getting better out here

197
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:32,610
in suburbia I am feeling better about it

198
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:35,370
if this is a stereotype the

199
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:37,780
fetishization saying like oh yeah

200
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:40,000
Filipinos are beautiful and both of the

201
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:42,610
smart stereotype and the beautiful

202
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,660
stereotype they're like nice stereotypes

203
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:46,420
but you know what they're still

204
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:48,820
stereotypes like nobody wants to be put

205
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:50,770
into this big group to just be lumped

206
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:52,540
together that's always just awkward you

207
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:55,540
know and then it becomes like about that

208
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:57,490
person's weird fetishes and hang-ups and

209
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:59,290
then it's like not even about you as an

210
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:01,390
individual anymore suddenly you're faced

211
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:03,760
with like some person's weirdness I was

212
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:06,310
always weirded out by the what are you

213
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:09,430
question what are you human and I've

214
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:11,770
heard the arguments well they're just

215
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:14,710
being curious about you they just want

216
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:17,170
to know more about you and expand their

217
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:19,870
own horizons and yeah but then again

218
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:22,390
that's about them and you're not

219
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:24,070
considering the feelings of the person

220
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:25,930
that your other that's what I have a

221
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:27,610
problem with the other ring would you be

222
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:29,800
asking me that if I was Caucasian

223
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:33,310
probably not oh my gosh there was just

224
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:34,840
one time at a bar my husband and I were

225
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:36,990
just sitting outside minding your own

226
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:40,240
business there was another couple

227
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:43,600
sitting at another table one of them the

228
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:46,780
guy comes over and he's like I'm sorry I

229
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,640
just I just gotta know if you're

230
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:50,110
asian-american you know when you're

231
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,270
gonna get the question like your spidey

232
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:53,950
sense tingle and then you're like

233
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:55,150
running through all the different kinds

234
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:57,220
of answers that you could have at that

235
00:10:55,150 --> 00:11:00,820
time depending on your mood I was in a

236
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:02,460
very chill mood at this time I got a no

237
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:06,120
where are you from

238
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:08,550
I know what that question means cuz then

239
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,710
I'm gonna say I'm from Chicago and then

240
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:13,020
he's gonna say no where are you really

241
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:14,820
from and then I have to be like my

242
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:18,420
parents are from the Philippines and

243
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:21,990
then oh okay yeah I'm glad it's okay for

244
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:25,680
me to be here now I'm sure he means well

245
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:27,240
and he just wants to connect but at the

246
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,060
same time I don't appreciate the other

247
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:32,820
ring oh you're not from here are you and

248
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:35,400
then it's just frustrating because hell

249
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:38,850
yeah I'm from here I was born here I was

250
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:40,590
raised here but I understand that's like

251
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:43,140
the struggle that Asian Americans

252
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:45,570
struggle with and I don't even want to

253
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:47,850
say struggle it's a very strong word

254
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:50,310
it's just like an internal it's a

255
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:52,440
questioning it's a questioning if you're

256
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:54,690
watching this and you've asked someone

257
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:58,710
that question it's okay don't feel bad

258
00:11:54,690 --> 00:12:01,620
just know that you know we might not be

259
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:03,510
cool with that um maybe you know there's

260
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:05,370
some people who are cool with that if

261
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:07,800
I'm just kind of navigating my own life

262
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:10,500
going about my business kind of one of

263
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:12,570
the last things I want to hear is like

264
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:16,110
hey you're different what are you like I

265
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:19,290
don't really owe you that answer comment

266
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:21,600
down below if you have experience with

267
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:24,420
that either way or if you've asked

268
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,970
someone what they are or if you get that

269
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:29,370
question a lot this might be kind of

270
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:32,100
going off topic a little bit we this is

271
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:35,010
about being proud of our heritage

272
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:38,640
I can understand Tagalog but I cannot

273
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:40,980
speak it and I think that comes from me

274
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:44,070
learning it at a young age and then

275
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:46,440
slowly growing out of it but I know for

276
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:48,150
a fact that if I spent a couple solid

277
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,470
months in the Philippines I would be

278
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:51,720
able to pick it back up again because

279
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:54,510
that's exactly what happened when my

280
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:57,210
parents took me and my brother back to

281
00:12:54,510 --> 00:13:00,210
the Philippines for a couple vacations

282
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:02,130
so my parents would speak Tagalog to

283
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:04,980
each other and then they would speak

284
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:08,310
English to me and my brother I think

285
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:13,530
that comes from them really wanting us

286
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:15,589
to assimilate to American culture and to

287
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:18,980
not be

288
00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:21,510
for a lack of a better term held back by

289
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:25,589
speaking Tagalog I think they just

290
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:28,140
really wanted us to become American they

291
00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:29,910
had worked so hard to get here and they

292
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,019
wanted to make sure me and my brother

293
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:34,200
assimilated

294
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:37,079
I really wish they kept teaching us at

295
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,970
preserving that but hey you know if I

296
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:41,279
wanted to continue learning I could have

297
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:45,450
done that on my own and I didn't I am

298
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:48,360
actively excited to take it all in and

299
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:50,220
to relearn I'm excited about exploring

300
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,350
my roots it's it's something that I'm

301
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,060
constantly working on it's definitely

302
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:56,790
gonna be a lifelong process

303
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:58,890
my cousins who were born here they kind

304
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:01,680
of have the same thing they don't really

305
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:04,920
speak the language because our parents

306
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,839
encouraged us to fully assimilate I

307
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:09,600
think we could have assimilated while

308
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:11,970
still preserving the language but it's

309
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:15,149
really interesting how that's not an

310
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:18,839
uncommon story with Filipino American

311
00:14:15,149 --> 00:14:21,390
kids kids it's 35 being a kid

312
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:25,020
among Filipino Americans in my

313
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:28,290
generation oh man language was never a

314
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:29,880
barrier between me and my parents since

315
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:32,700
they speak English

316
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:35,190
extremely fluently I could have complex

317
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:37,079
conversations about anything with my

318
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:39,720
parents where there is a barrier was

319
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:43,250
culturally oh my goodness because my

320
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:45,899
poor parents they grew up one way and

321
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:48,000
then they come to this new country

322
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:51,029
they're struggling to figure out what's

323
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:55,490
normal in America what is a good way to

324
00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:59,070
raise my kids in America while

325
00:14:55,490 --> 00:15:01,079
preserving the values that I have like I

326
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:03,540
imagine that's a struggle that they

327
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:06,140
dealt with where I was coming from my

328
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:10,260
parents were stuck in the old ways and

329
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:13,199
this is how kids are in this generation

330
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:15,390
and in America I had to convince them

331
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,949
that sleepovers are normal but they

332
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,519
didn't grow up having sleepovers that's

333
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:19,709
weird

334
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:22,110
for them right so can you imagine your

335
00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:23,699
kids telling you that and you never

336
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:25,949
experienced that and you're like that's

337
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:27,810
a thing like that's I don't think so I

338
00:15:25,949 --> 00:15:28,240
don't think you should be going over to

339
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:30,279
other people

340
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:35,050
houses and sleeping in them that was one

341
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:36,700
of many cultural generational clashes

342
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:40,180
that we would have oh my gosh high

343
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:43,450
school high school was such a struggle

344
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:47,290
because that's where you do so much

345
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:50,830
growing so quickly and it was again a

346
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:53,589
constant battle of yes it's normal to go

347
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:56,620
out hang out with friends to stay out

348
00:15:53,589 --> 00:15:59,170
this late to do this and to do that and

349
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:00,820
I swear I wasn't trying to pull the wool

350
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:03,640
over their eyes I just wanted to do

351
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:05,110
normal American kid stuff that's where

352
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:07,930
we were coming at from both sides

353
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:10,750
because I was living a life that they

354
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:13,810
couldn't even in that sense I give them

355
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:15,790
mad props for taking themselves out of a

356
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:19,120
place that they know and going to a

357
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:21,850
completely new place and trying to raise

358
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:25,480
a family in it that's that's insane they

359
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:27,550
did a phenomenal job and I do thank them

360
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:30,160
for it through the struggles through the

361
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:32,920
fights they instilled really good values

362
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:35,079
in me and my brother and that's those

363
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:39,640
are values that are really strong within

364
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:42,130
me today family working hard and that

365
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:44,230
sense of entrepreneurialism being loving

366
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:47,890
and being kind that's something that can

367
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:50,380
transcend culture if you have those

368
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:51,880
values and they're passed on that's

369
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:54,760
that's a really good foundation for

370
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:56,980
future generation that I am thankful for

371
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,930
my parents are amazing my parents are my

372
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:03,040
heroes how long do you have

373
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:06,100
I could wax on about how incredible my

374
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:09,120
mother is and how hard-working she is

375
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:11,579
and she really set that example of

376
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:14,920
putting your nose to the grindstone and

377
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:18,490
working for what you want my dad has

378
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:21,550
been so instrumental in being an amazing

379
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:23,860
example for me and my brother about the

380
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:26,559
importance of friendship and the

381
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:29,470
importance of fostering a relationship

382
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:31,690
with people who mean so much to you

383
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:34,120
whether that's your actual family or

384
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:36,160
chosen family what I am super grateful

385
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:40,540
for with my parents is that they never

386
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,960
once were like oh you have to go into a

387
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:45,039
meadow

388
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:48,370
goal or professional feel they saw right

389
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:51,279
away that I was a creative person and

390
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:53,860
they did everything they could to foster

391
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:56,140
that and to encourage that so they

392
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:59,320
invested in all of the art classes all

393
00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:02,470
of the art tools everything and they

394
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:05,169
definitely held fast to the adage that

395
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:08,590
whatever you want to do make sure you do

396
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:12,130
it well that's what I did and they're

397
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:14,429
amazing for that I love it I'm proud to

398
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:16,929
be Filipino American which is why

399
00:18:14,429 --> 00:18:21,070
exploring my roots is going to be a

400
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:23,440
lifelong process I would love to learn

401
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:26,140
the language again I would love to

402
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,700
really dig my heels into the history of

403
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:30,460
it again because after a time in my

404
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:32,770
younger years of rejecting it I think

405
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:34,690
that had to happen for me to fully

406
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:38,140
appreciate it so I wouldn't change a

407
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:40,899
thing about my struggles with accepting

408
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:45,130
Who I am or a time from fourth grade

409
00:18:40,899 --> 00:18:47,890
when I moved to the southwest suburbs up

410
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:52,590
until I was a sophomore junior in high

411
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:55,990
school I was actively rejecting my

412
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:58,029
heritage and then it wasn't until high

413
00:18:55,990 --> 00:19:00,789
school when one of my really good

414
00:18:58,029 --> 00:19:03,130
friends who was Caucasian that she had

415
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:05,080
to do this report on another country and

416
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:06,940
she chose the Philippines which I felt

417
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,190
two ways about it I was like flattered

418
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:11,590
but I was also a little bit confused

419
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:14,110
like well hi I was like there's so many

420
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:16,210
other cooler countries that's awful but

421
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:19,120
that's how I felt at the time I was

422
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:21,789
being lifted from this pool of rejecting

423
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,980
my heritage so that's what my friend was

424
00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:25,299
doing for me she had this book to do her

425
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:27,549
report and she was showing me all these

426
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:29,799
amazing pictures of the lands and the

427
00:19:27,549 --> 00:19:32,140
people and the food and she was like oh

428
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:35,470
my god the food is amazing

429
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:37,450
whoa is this what you grew up eating and

430
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:40,779
I was like yeah I was having flashbacks

431
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:43,120
to family parties where my aunt who is a

432
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:46,179
caterer she would bring over amazing

433
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,520
Filipino food and my grandma who lived

434
00:19:46,179 --> 00:19:51,190
with us for a time she would make

435
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,350
Filipino food all day every day so yes

436
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:55,950
that's another we're

437
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:59,759
dilemma I would reject being Filipino

438
00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:03,210
but I would also consume Filipino food

439
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:04,740
at home because my grandma would cook it

440
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:07,679
all the time my Lola you know what it

441
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:10,049
was it felt like being two people it

442
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,529
felt like I had to be I was one way at

443
00:20:10,049 --> 00:20:14,820
home and then I had to be another way

444
00:20:12,529 --> 00:20:16,679
outside of the home I was just really

445
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:19,860
embarrassed if anybody asked me about

446
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:21,929
what I was or I was like out here with

447
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:23,399
my Batman mascot so that's why I would

448
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:25,110
really throw me off on anybody

449
00:20:23,399 --> 00:20:27,750
outside of the home would asked me like

450
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:30,360
oh are you know what are you and I'd be

451
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:31,679
like whoa whoa I'm out here with my with

452
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,840
with my mask on what are you doing

453
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,669
asking me about that stuff I'm outside

454
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,250
of the house not in the house so my

455
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:39,809
friend who was really getting into this

456
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:42,720
report it was fun

457
00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:45,149
rediscovering the Filipino culture

458
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,269
through her eyes because it made me

459
00:20:45,149 --> 00:20:51,000
appreciate it she had turned on the

460
00:20:48,269 --> 00:20:52,710
light bulb of appreciation for my own

461
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,789
culture she was asking me all these

462
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:56,429
questions

463
00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:58,980
I felt really a shame that I didn't know

464
00:20:56,429 --> 00:21:01,980
a lot of them in a way I was kind of

465
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:04,200
doing my own personal report on the

466
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:05,820
Philippines she was like oh my gosh next

467
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,259
time you have a big family party can you

468
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:09,779
invite me so I could have all the food

469
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:12,750
and I was like yeah yeah sure totally so

470
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:14,519
she came over and had some food and she

471
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:18,000
was just like loved and everything and

472
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:20,570
it was really cool to see because these

473
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,299
were foods that I had spent my childhood

474
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:26,429
keeping a secret from other kids at

475
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:28,889
school there was this one incident where

476
00:21:26,429 --> 00:21:32,909
I brought this dish called pancit for

477
00:21:28,889 --> 00:21:35,190
lunch this kid in my class saw it and he

478
00:21:32,909 --> 00:21:38,580
was like being super rude about it he

479
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:41,610
was like oh what is that that's so gross

480
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:43,710
oh my god what is that I just remember

481
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:46,740
just sitting there and like shamefully

482
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:49,919
just eating my food and keeping my head

483
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:52,019
down while this was making fun of my

484
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,360
food and it just kept happening I think

485
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:59,279
that was the beginning of me rejecting

486
00:21:54,360 --> 00:22:01,019
my culture but that's okay because that

487
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:03,029
rejection I wouldn't change a thing

488
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:05,519
because it really makes me appreciate my

489
00:22:03,029 --> 00:22:06,200
heritage and my culture even more you

490
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:08,930
know I

491
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:11,270
appreciate the experiences that I have

492
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:13,940
been through and that have enriched me

493
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:16,490
as a person and now I have something to

494
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:18,740
contribute to the world also I really

495
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:21,100
love the values that I've learned that

496
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:24,230
idea that you don't really quite feel

497
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:27,380
Filipino and you don't really quite feel

498
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:29,810
American that was so prevalent during

499
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:32,560
one of my trips to the Philippines I was

500
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:36,500
in high school and it was really crazy

501
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:39,170
going there because everyone kind of

502
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:42,800
looked like me and I really felt a sense

503
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:45,860
of belonging but that was until I had to

504
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:50,210
talk to anyone and it became very

505
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:51,890
apparent that I was American my mom and

506
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:53,570
I were eating at a restaurant one day

507
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:55,490
she kind of leans over to me and she's

508
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:57,680
like hey those girls behind you they

509
00:22:55,490 --> 00:23:00,310
were kind of commenting on me I think it

510
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:03,320
was more fascination than being rude

511
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:05,600
again maybe a cultural thing my mom was

512
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:07,460
like they can tell you're American and I

513
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,050
was like what how do they know the way

514
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:11,360
you walked the way you hold yourself

515
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:14,720
you're very American another example of

516
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:18,170
that weird dilemma was this one time we

517
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:21,160
were at a carnival and I was doing

518
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:24,350
bumper cars and my bumper car broke down

519
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:26,390
mechanic came over to help me and he was

520
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:29,450
instructing me to do something in

521
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:31,100
Tagalog but I couldn't quite understand

522
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:33,230
him it was loud and he was speaking

523
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:36,650
really fast you know I probably have the

524
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:38,720
vocabulary of a four five year old so I

525
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:42,620
really felt out of my element like oh my

526
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:44,390
god I look like everyone but I don't

527
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:46,790
quite fit in I was able to figure it out

528
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:50,530
that was another incident which told me

529
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:53,870
Wow okay so you belong here but you also

530
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:55,700
don't now I think of that approach as

531
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:58,670
not being a negative but being a

532
00:23:55,700 --> 00:24:01,790
positive it really adds dimension to my

533
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:03,440
personal experience and I am grateful

534
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:05,030
for that and I think that's one of the

535
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,530
things I love about being Filipino

536
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:11,840
American I also love the rich history of

537
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:14,480
the Philippines there is so much more

538
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:17,620
for me to learn I have a lot of cousins

539
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:20,799
my mom's side there's ten of them

540
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:23,169
on my dad's side there were eight those

541
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:26,440
are a lot of babies so can you imagine

542
00:24:23,169 --> 00:24:29,020
just how many cousins bulk of them in

543
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:30,100
the Philippines Canada all throughout

544
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:32,799
the United States

545
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:34,390
rather a few in China oh I think there's

546
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:38,320
one Australia that's what I love about

547
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:41,110
my family specifically is that we are

548
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:45,100
everywhere and to me that makes the

549
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:48,549
world feel like a smaller place I feel

550
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:51,220
like I can go and visit them and say hey

00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:54,220
