00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,079
from here

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,360
my dad is from sunset if you guys don't

24
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,719

25
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,120
district in san francisco

26
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,320
and my mom is from vallejo so the bay

27
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,079
area is home for me

28
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,879
the next question i received is how old

29
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,559
are you and i am 20 years old

30
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,160
next question is my most popular

31
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:59,039
question i get online and

32
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,160
in life in general and it's what is your

33
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,760
ethnicity

34
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:07,040
and my ethnicity is drum roll please

35
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,840
it's literally not that serious i am a

36
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,479
japanese

37
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,040
german and filipino so i am white and

38
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,880
asian

39
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,400
that might come as a surprise to some

40
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,680
people because a lot of people do think

41
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,360
i am latina

42
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,040
i mean it makes sense i did grow up in

43
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,000
like a predominantly spanish-speaking

44
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,080
neighborhood

45
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,520
and i am a little bit of filipino to the

46
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,680
point where some people like

47
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,720
have called me like really rude terms

48
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,400
because they think

49
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,000
like i'm not asian if that makes sense

50
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,360
so for example i was talking to a

51
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,280
co-worker one time

52
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,799
and i was telling her that like i wear a

53
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,320
yokura when i walk around my house which

54
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,840
is like a japanese house robe

55
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,759
and she was like you're a culture

56
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,000
appropriator you take japanese culture

57
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,680
you're

58
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,159
racist against asian people and i was

59
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,000
like i'm japanese and she's like oh my

60
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,720
god i'm so sorry that you're mexican and

61
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,880
i was like

62
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,159
oh okay but with that being said cause i

63
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,880
literally talked about this question for

64
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,200
so long

65
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,000
um i am white and asian so the next

66
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,240
question i received

67
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,079
is do you have any siblings if so how

68
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,880
many and are you the oldest or the

69
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,960
youngest

70
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,399
so i actually do have siblings i have

71
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,640
four siblings and

72
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,719
i have four brothers and they are all

73
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,520
older than me so i am the youngest girl

74
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,360
out of five

75
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,599

and my son sign as a libra i resonate

77
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,720
with my son sign so much but

78
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,160

79
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,319

108
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,400
chick-fil-a fast food anymore because

109
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,920

it's just the culture that i grew up in

128
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,040
everyone around me has always listened

129
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,959
to rap music so that's kind of the music

130
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,720
that i listen to when i get ready

131
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,159
but as for like who is my favorite

132

and i just think she's so bomb and so

138
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,720

to be in front of the camera i love to

150
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,560
talk to people so i'd love to be either

151
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,960
a news anchor

152
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,080
or a sports news anchor or even just

153
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,320
like celebrity news

154
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,160
anchor like i'd love to be any type of

155
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,600
broadcasting position

156
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,360
i love being in front of the camera and

157
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,680
i think it's so obvious to you guys that

158
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,759
i

159
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,759
love like doing what i'm doing the

160
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,360
theater major requires you to take a lot

161
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,720
of on-camera classes

162
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,560
and it works perfectly with my

163
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,160
journalism major when i'm a broadcaster

164
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,199
because i know how to present myself in

165
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,680
front of a camera

166
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,440
so i love my theater major if you guys

167
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,280
have ever like wanted to work on your

168
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,880
public speaking or ever wanted

169
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,240
a job where you're going to speak in

170
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,280
front of large groups i definitely

171
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,440
recommend that you

172
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,360
look at minoring in theater like it is a

173
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,080
great addition and it's super super

174
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,440
underrated

175
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,360
i feel like when people think of public

176
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,880
speaking majors they their minds first

177
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,720
goes to communications

178
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,320
um but definitely check out theater i

179
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,759
did major in communications i do have my

180
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,800
aaa in communications

181
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,479
and it was okay but i did prefer my aaa

182
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,000
and theater it was like so much more fun

183
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,919
but it actually works out perfectly

184
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,280
because in both positions i get to work

185
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,960
in front of the camera and learn how to

186
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,759
speak to a bigger audience and that's

187
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,919
ultimately

188
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,840
what my dream job is and i actually got

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,479
a question what is your dream job

193
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,000
one of my like secret dream careers is

194
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,440
that i really want to be a working

195
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,759

196
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,520
major role with somebody so the next

197
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,919
question i received is do you have a job

198
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,240
outside of youtube and i do have a job

199
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,960
um i work at a movie theater which goes

200
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,639
perfectly

201
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,800
with my like being in front of the

202
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,520
camera wanting to major in journalism

203
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,199
wanting to be an actress type thing next

204
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,160
question is do you drink coffee if so

205
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,000
what is your order

206
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,000
i do drink coffee i drink coffee every

207
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,400
single morning i make myself a

208
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,240
toffeena iced coffee and then i pour

209
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,680
hazelnut creamer and caramel drizzle in

210
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,440
it and it's a fire

211
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,199
i usually don't get coffee when i go out

212
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,199
just because i like the coffee that i

213
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,240
make at home i'm very like precise about

214
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,400
my coffee

215
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,400
um but if i do order coffee at starbucks

216
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,319
i'll get an iced coffee

217
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,160
with heavy cream and four pumps of white

218
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,000
chocolate mocha so the next question is

219
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,160
have you ever played any sports how were

220
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,440
the coaches and i played literally every

221
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,319
single sport that you can think of

222
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,840
growing up like

223
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,600
if you can think of a sport i played it

224
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,520
like even football like i played the

225
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,880
flag version but literally i played

226
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,800
every single sport

227
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,400
and i've always had really awesome

228
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,440
coaches i've never had like these super

229
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,120
scary ones

230
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,120
if i had to think my basketball coach

231
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,440
was probably my scariest coach but like

232
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,240
even so he was pretty nice

233
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,280
but the last sport ever played was

234
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,199
varsity swim

235
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,479
i was on the swim team when i was in

236
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,240
high school um

237
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,840
and that was it that was like the very

238
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,960
last sport i played next question i

239
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,680
received is do you

240
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,280
like to be called kayla or michaela and

241
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,720
it's so funny that you guys asked me

242
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,160
this is because i feel like

243
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,000
if you have been here since i had like

244
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,520
200 subscribers you would know that my

245
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,199
name on youtube used to be michaela

246
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,199
wegner which is my full name

247
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,199
um but i did switch it to kayla and the

248
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,280
reason why i switched it to kayla

249
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,840
was actually because somebody took the

250
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,360
liberty to go in my comment section and

251
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,639
leak my address for some reason they

252
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,680
like put my zip code but my whole

253
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,759
address put my

254
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,039
area code and everything the town i grew

255
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,759
up in like they was putting all my

256
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,680
information

257
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:34,319
in the comment section and i was like

258
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,919
for what so i had to switch my name on

259
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,479
youtube from my full name

260
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,000
to jess kayla i know some people met me

261
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,000
as michaela so they prefer to call me

262
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,360
michaela but some people met me as kayla

263
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,360
so that's what they call me

264
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,800
i honestly do not have a preference but

265
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,240
that is the only reason why if you guys

266
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,759
are wondering like why i switched my

267
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,199
name or what should you call me

268
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,039
that's the reason why i switched it but

269
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,000
honestly like call me whatever like you

270
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,400
feel comfortable doing

271
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,360
so what is your biggest pet peeve and

272
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,120
honestly i

273
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,800
feel like i have so many pet peeves but

274
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,840
obviously because i'm recording i just

275
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,160
blank out on

276
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,840
it but the first one that comes in my

277
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,840
mind when i think of my pet peeves

278
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,360
is when people purposefully like wear

279
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,199
their mask underneath their nose like

280
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,000
it's one thing if it like slips down

281
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,560
like that's okay

282
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,319
y'all like like it happens but when

283
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,520
people purposely like place it

284
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,120
underneath their nose i feel like

285
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,840
they're like flashing me i'm like

286
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,919
pull it up a little bit pull it up so um

287
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,680
that's one of my pet peeves but

288
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,680
i'm sure i have a lot more pet peeves

289
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,080
that i just like am blanking on right

290
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,840
now

291
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,919
what do you like to do in your down time

292
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,760
and honestly if i have like complete

293
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,640
downtime like no homework

294
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,240
no work no nothing um i just like to sit

295
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,479
down and watch youtube videos i am like

296
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,159
a little hermit like that i can honestly

297
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,000
like my screen time y'all is kind of

298
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,440
ridiculous like i will sit down and

299
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,720
watch youtube videos for eight hours

300
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,440
straight and literally have no problem

301
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,360
doing that

302
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,519
i genuinely like to watch other people's

303
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,760
videos so that is a big thing i like to

304
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,200
do

305
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,880
so i got the question of do you have a

306
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,760
boyfriend if so how long have you guys

307
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,080
been dating

308
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,839
i actually do not have a boyfriend right

309
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,640
now i'm chilling just because i

310
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,839
am going to probably move soon in the

311
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,600
next couple months

312
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,600
it's not set in stone but i am in the

313
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,120
process of trying to move

314
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,880
so i do not want to get into a committed

315
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,200
relationship right before i move

316
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,120
so i'm okay right now the next question

317
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,640
i received is do you want children and i

318
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,120
actually do want children if i could

319
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,440
have it

320
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,560
my way um i would want to be like my

321
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,880
parents and have

322
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,800
five kids four boys and one girl but

323
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,200
honestly my main goal is just to have at

324
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,959
least four kids like minimum four kids

325
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,320

326
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,000
is your biggest dream

327
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,440

328
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,920
did tell you guys but

329
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,760
my biggest dream of all time is to work

334
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,000
dream the next question i received is

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,040
would you ever start a brand and a

336
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,399
hundred percent

337
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,000
i don't even think i mentioned that for

338
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,160
one of my biggest goals but one of my

339
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,800
biggest goals as well is to start my own

340
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,160
brands

341
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,760
i don't know what it would be i don't

342
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,040
know it would be perfume or makeup or

343
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,480
clothing or like

344
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,399
a stationery if you guys don't know that

345
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,000
about me i love pens

346
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,079
or if i would write my own book but i

347
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
want something to my name

348
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:08,399
so i would love to make my own brand one

349
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,640
day so i just have to think of ideas and

350
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,079
work my way there somebody said what do

351
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,519
you want people to know about your

352
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,959
personality and

353
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,279
something i would love for you guys to

354
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,160
know is that i am a very very driven

355
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,079
person

356
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,839
um i am somebody that's constantly

357
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,600
wanting to create and do new things

358
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,279
i think we all have that one person in

359
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,880
our life where they talk to you and it's

360
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,720
like every single time they talk to you

361
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,480
they're doing something new and

362
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,399
it's so funny because i feel like i have

363
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,200
like people in my life that kind of evil

364
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,640
eye me

365
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,079
like i have like family members or

366
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,920
friends and when i tell them i want to

367
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,760
start a new project they're kind of like

368
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,920
oh like why don't you finish the last

369
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,760
one you started but that's just never me

370
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,360
i'm constantly on the move and i'm

371
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,000
constantly wanting to grow

372
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,920
and i am just like i have big dreams and

373
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,880
big goals and i plan on attaining every

374
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,320
single one of them

375
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,240
so if i could let you guys know anything

376
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,360
about my personality is that like

377
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,519
baby i dream big and i i go for it so

378
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,360
everything i want in life i genuinely

379
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,880
go out there and i put my effort in to

380
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,240
achieve so that is something i would

381
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,760
love for you guys to know about me

382
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,120
so now we're gonna go more into like the

383
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,640
youtube based questions because i

384
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,079
received a lot of those but i was saving

385
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,680
those towards the end just because i

386
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,680
wanted you guys to get to know me

387
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,279
on a more personal level first a whole

388
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,040
bunch of people ask me what made you

389
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,800
start your youtube channel so i think it

390
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,920
is very apparent that i do love talking

391
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,600
in front of the camera but that is

392
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,480
actually not the reason why i started my

393
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,079
youtube channel

394
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,200
i started my youtube channel genuinely

395
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:29,920
because i love talking to other people

396
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,279
not just talking to a camera so i

397
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,279
started my youtube channel to talk to

398
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,120
the camera but i continued going and

399
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,240
continue to make videos because of the

400
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,920
comments that you guys

401
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,360
leave to me i don't think you guys

402
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,360
realize that when you guys leave me a

403
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,279
comment that makes my entire day

404
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,640
way that you guys can tell me about how

405
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,680
your day's going and tell me what

406
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,680
products you're into

407
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,040
and telling me like you know just

408
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,680
anything about yourself

409
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,200
makes me so so happy and that's really

410
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,800
why i started my youtube channel was

411
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,399
just to get to know other people and to

412
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,560
make friends and just to

413
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,079
you know grow in who i know in this

414
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,440
world and i think that's so beautiful

415
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,880
about youtube is that how

416
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,320
i have friends literally in the

417
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,600
philippines right now i have friends in

418
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,880
new jersey right now

419
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,720
i have friends all over the world you

420
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,320
guys tell me you're from the uk or india

421
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,760
and it just makes me so happy

422
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,600
and that's why i started my youtube

423
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,279
channel was just to talk to people like

424
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,880
you guys the next question i received is

425
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,399
how long have you been monetized

426
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,880
slash how long have you been doing

427
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,519
youtube so i have been monetized i think

428
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,639
since like

429
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,440
february like 15th or 16th some some day

430
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,760
like that

431
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,200
um somewhere in mid february um and how

432
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,519
long have you been doing youtube it

433
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,839
honestly depends what you consider

434
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,160
um because i used to make like i think

435
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,639
in like 2017 i made one video

436
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:41,120
i think in 2018 i made one video i think

437
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,120
in 2019 i make two videos like

438
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,240
you know what i'm saying like it depends

439
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,079
what you really consider

440
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,360
when did i start consistently making

441
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,480
videos was

442
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,320
in december so december of 2020 is when

443
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,079
i consistently started making videos

444
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,519
the next question is how do you deal

445
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,959
with hate and i don't know if you guys

446
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,959
know this but i

447
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,399
actually do receive a lot of hate which

448
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,079
was funny but not funny

449
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,160
because i didn't think i would get hate

450
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,920
until i became like a bigger channel i

451
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,720
do could still consider myself a small

452
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,639
youtuber

453
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,560
and i never thought i would receive hate

454
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,000
like at the amounts that i did

455
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,519
but one thing that i always remind

456
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,959
myself and it's funny because jasmine

457
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,399
said this in her video and i

458
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,680
it's so when she said that my jaw

459
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,240
dropped because i literally tell my

460
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,399
friends that

461
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,639
same exact thing all the time and it's

462
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,279
that people that like send me hate

463
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,440
online

464
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,959
would never have the audacity to say

465
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,800
that stuff to my face like

466
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,399
you literally would not be able to walk

467
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,040
up to me and talk to me the way that you

468
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,720
do

469
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,639
and it's just funny how like behind the

470
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,880
screen people just get this wave of

471
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,560
confidence to be rude to other people

472
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,920
and it's like okay but would you say

473
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,920
that to my face though

474
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,680
so that's something that i remind myself

475
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,519
is that like you know people

476
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,959
are this way just because it's the

477
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,639
internet but one of the biggest things i

478
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,040
do to help myself with hate

479
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,199
is genuinely look at the nice comments

480
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:56,240
for every hate comment i receive

481
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:58,000
i receive like 20 nice comments and that

482
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,519
genuinely keeps me going that's the main

483
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,959
thing i do if i ever receive a hate

484
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,399
comment i will just go and i'll find a

485
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,519
positive comment and i'll read it i'll

486
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,199
remind myself

487
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,720
that there are really really awesome

488
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,839
people out there in this world and you

489
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,079
just gotta choose

490
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,519
to acknowledge them over the shitty

491
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,880
people next question is

youtube

549
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,800
it was a very small community but like

550
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,560
it was still there

551
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,800
um so i've always been into the hygiene

552
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,279
side but i didn't get into fragrances

553
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,880

555
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,360

fragrances so if you guys did not know i

583
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,079

590
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,280

thank you right now your girl is a

592
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,000
little stressed

593
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,079
it is that time of the school year where

594
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,360
teachers are just really cracking down

595
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,039
on their assignments so

596
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,799
i have a whole bunch of assignments i

597
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,760
have work as you guys know like i said

598
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,160
earlier i do

599
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,919
work full time so i work like four days

600
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,480
a week and i also go to school four days

601
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,160
a week

602
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,319
and now i have my beautiful youtube

603
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,600
channel so i am a little stressed trying

604
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,919
to balance everything out with that

605
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,799
being said i am so abundantly blessed

606
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,720
and grateful

607
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:37,520
and i like to view all the things that i

608
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:40,000
see as stress in my life as good stress

609
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,760
so like instead of viewing it like oh

610
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,120
like i have school work to do i'm always

611
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,840
like oh well at least i'm getting my

612
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,600
education

613
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,039
like i always try to flip things on me

614
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,240
and remind myself that the things i

615
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,880
stress about are good

616
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,000
stressors and they're healthy for me and

617
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,360
they just help to

618
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,960
boost me to where i want to be

619
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,200
eventually in life but with that being

620
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,960
