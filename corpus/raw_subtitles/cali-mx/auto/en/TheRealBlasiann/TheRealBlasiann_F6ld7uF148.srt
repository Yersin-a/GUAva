questions that has to do with like my

48
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,759

malaysian

52
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:16,400
let's get into this video right now

53
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,599
so the first question is how old are you

54
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,239
what's your sign and when is your

55
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,200
birthday

56
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,800
so i just turned 22 years old my

57
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,920
birthday is september 15

58
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,800
1998 and i am a

59
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,000
virgo no cocky [ __ ] i feel like burgers

60
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,160
is the best sign

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,840
like if i wasn't even a virgo i would

62
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,560
still say virgos is the best sign

63
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,519
because what like beyonce's a virgo

64
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,480

65
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,480
is a virgo

66
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,800
okay question number two

um yeah so i'm still in school i'm doing

72
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,480

73
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,000
but i just want to walk the stage

74
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,360
honestly i don't care where i'm doing

75
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,519
school from just as long as i get to

76
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,000

stitch i'm good

79
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,280
question number three any advice for

80
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,440
high schoolers or college advice

81
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,959
um let me think back to when i was in

82
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,040
high school because that

83
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,879
was a really long time ago i graduated

84
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,840
in 2016

85
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:30,799
but i personally did not take high

86
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,799
school serious at all

87
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,319
um freshman year i had straight a's i

88
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,319
was like

89
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,400
real good kids sophomore and junior

90
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:42,640
definitely worked hard and they kept

91
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,879
my butt senior year i picked up

92
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,159
the slack and my grades was good just

93
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,560
like freshman year

94
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,280
but i feel like colleges really look at

95
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,200
your

96
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,519
sophomore and junior year grades not so

97
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,560
much your freshman or your senior year

98
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,560
um and that's where like i got that

99
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,640
and so with the grades that i had in my

100
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,640
overall gpa i just knew i wasn't going

101
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,640
to be able to go to like berkeley or

102
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,200
ucla

103
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,560
all the top schools that i would hope to

104
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,040
have went to

105
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,640
so i chose the route of going to a

106
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,599
junior college for two years

107
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,759
i went to de anza community college i

108
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,359
play basketball for them too

109
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,519
but i went to danza community college

110
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,199
for two years and then i reapplied to

111
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,880
colleges

112
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,400
after the two years and i ended up

113
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,400
getting into ucla

114
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,440
high school advice i would definitely

115
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,479
say

116
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:35,199
take your grades seriously like

117
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,560
if you don't want to go to a jc for two

118
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,639
years and you want to go straight

119
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,600
out of high school take high school

120
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,440
seriously

121
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,199
but also make time for your social life

122
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,280
so you have to find a balance between

123
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,160
your social life and your school life

124
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,639
um me i was more of just like social

125
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,120
life so

126
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,000
i was an athlete i was just you know

127
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,919
wanted to

128
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,840
play ball and all that

129
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,840
but i went to an all asian school so it

130
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,520
was a lot of pressure on the students

131
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,919
that went there because

132
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,199
not stereotyping not trying to be racist

133
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,400
or nothing but

134
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:13,440
asians are known to take schooling more

135
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,479
serious you know so i would definitely

136
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,520
say

137
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:20,639
do work hard but

138
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,160
find a balance again between schoolwork

139
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,400
and your social life because you have to

140
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,000
have both there you can't just have a

141
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,240
school life and no social life whereas

142
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,320
you're gonna go crazy advice for

143
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,880
college college my first two years

144
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,560
of community college was so fun because

145
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,720
i don't know when i went to college

146
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,639
i was expecting it to be a heavy

147
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,560
workload i'm gonna be stressed out it's

148
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,080
gonna be so many classes so much

149
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,360
going on because i was playing

150
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,800
basketball too so i was like there's no

151
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,720
way i'm gonna be able to juggle this

152
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,880
but i did really well my first two years

153
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,080
of college while i was still playing

154
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,160
ball um i made so many new friends like

155
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,600
all the athletes were in the same class

156
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,479
so y'all can imagine just a whole

157
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,160
classroom full of

158
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,759
football players basketball players

159
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,880
baseball players soccer players like

160
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,479
it was lit okay

161
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,400
but that was good because you're

162
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,919
surrounded by people who

163
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,160
know what you're going through what

164
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,560
you're experiencing having a juggle

165
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,720
okay i got a game this day but i got a

166
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,120
midterm and final this day too like you

167
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,319
know

168
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,240
we were all like in cahoots with

169
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,360
each other like supporting each other

170
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,720
through the whole

171
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,039
class and that was really good

172
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,639
advice for college so when i got to ucla

173
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:34,400
i really didn't

174
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,880
make friends like i was making at a jc

175
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,560
like

176
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,919
it was a whole different ballgame for me

177
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,120
a new environment i'm

178
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,720
originally from the bay area so i moved

179
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,759
down to southern california

180
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,919
la to go to school and i knew nobody

181
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,639
there i knew one girl that's from

182
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:54,080
vallejo california which is like

183
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:56,319
30 minutes from me um and she was going

184
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,680
to you see she got into ucla as well

185
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,199
and that was like the only person i was

186
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,160
kind of hanging out with we had so many

187
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,759
classes together

188
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:06,000

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,360
on my parents a lot while i was in

224
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,319

do

254
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,800
none of that it was simply just like

385
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:28,639
versace is cool davinci is cool

386
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,959
um i'm trying to think offlight is cool

387
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,839
but

388
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,959
i think my favorite brand really is

389
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,240
chanel

390
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:40,560
like them sneakers yeah

391
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:43,680
what question 12 how do you save money

392
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:47,040
this is hard because i spend so

393
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:50,079
much money like

394
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,800
it's done but what i

395
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,279
used to do is before i started getting

396
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,399
that

397
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,519
big bag what i used to do was when i

398
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,880
would get paid

399
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:03,760
i would put half of my check

400
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,639
in my savings and then like half of my

401
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,279
check it was

402
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,920
to spend so it might not be half it

403
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,600
might be

404
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,040
majority of my check went to my savings

405
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,880
and i would keep like 100 or

406
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,720
hundred dollars for me to spend and i

407
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,079
did that every paycheck and i wasn't

408
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,839
really spending then

409
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,600
so like if you have two hundred dollars

410
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,959
and say your checkings and then your

411
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,880
next check you put it under two hundred

412
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,560
dollars it starts stacking nothing sorry

413
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,519
is so money so you got some money in

414
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,120
your checkings

415
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,920
but you also got some money in your

416
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:33,360
savings you got to do it like that

417
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:36,079
and if you can't buy something let's say

418
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,600
five times over don't buy it once and

419
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,639
this doesn't go for like

420
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,199
your dream house or a car that you want

421
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,519
or whatever

422
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:45,440

how do you feel about the hate that you

614
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,720
receive regarding your love life

615
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:44,720
i honestly do not care because at the

616
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,679
end of the day i'm probably not going to

617
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,840
meet

618
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,960
half of y'all let alone a handful of

619
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,480
y'all so

620
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:55,760
i don't let what other people say affect

621
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:58,799
me and how i feel about myself or how i

622
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:01,120
view myself and those who truly

623
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,480
know me and love me and are around me on

624
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:06,000
a daily basis

625
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:08,320
on a daily basis don't care what

626
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,159
somebody who doesn't know me has to say

627
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,440
like they know the real me y'all don't

628
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,919
know the real me

629
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,080
y'all only know what is out there on the

630
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,200
media y'all don't know the real story

631
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,559
behind

632
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:22,000
all the tea that you see or any of this

633
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,080
so i don't really let

634
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,240
the hay get to me i don't read comments

635
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,799

636
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,640
post my pictures work and get off like i

637
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:32,400

00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,960
through the shade room or scroll through

639
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,840

642
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,840
know i'm not ugly

643
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:46,880
and your boyfriend doesn't think i'm

644
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:50,559
ugly either so

645
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:54,320
stop the cat no kizzy

646
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:56,320
but in all seriousness serious mess

647
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,240
i don't let any of that faze me i don't

648
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,159
let it bother me

649
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,320
because at the end of the day it doesn't

650
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:06,159
stop a bag

651
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:08,400
over here like me and mine we straight

652
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:12,080
worry about you and yours sleeping on

653
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,080
that air mattress with roaches in your

654
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,080
house

655
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,679
question 29 what is your favorite thing

656
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,080
about yourself

657
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,440
i think my favorite thing about myself

658
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,080
is

659
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,880
i have multiple things my personality

660
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,279
one

661
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,880
i'm just super outgoing i'm funny i'm

662
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,919
chill like i don't really take nothing

663
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:34,080
serious

664
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:37,120
i don't really let anything bother me

665
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:39,279
and then i would have to say like

666
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,720
the tough skin that i have developed

667
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:43,840
over time i've never

668
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,480
always i've never always had

669
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:48,080

673
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,039
to brush things off to not listen to the

haters

675
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,400
to not let somebody's opinion or how

676
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:05,200
they feel about me

677
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,039
