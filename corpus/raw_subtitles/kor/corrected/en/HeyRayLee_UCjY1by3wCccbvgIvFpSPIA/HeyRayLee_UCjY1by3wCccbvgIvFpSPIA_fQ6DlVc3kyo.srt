00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,710
hey guys welcome back to my channel so

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:07,560
today I wanted to record a video where I

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:10,440
give advice to my younger self.

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,059
I'm turning 28 this year so I thought it

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,950
would be a really good way to reflect

6
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:16,199
back on the past ten years of my

7
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,990
life considering I went to high school

8
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:21,750
went to college and essentially started

9
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,890
this adulthood and started working so I

10
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,680
thought it'd be a really good way to

11
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,960
reflect back and show you guys some of

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,310
my experiences. So if you guys are going

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,920
through this hopefully you guys can

14
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,989
relate. So without further ado here are

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,079
advices that I would give to my younger

16
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:39,510
self. High school. You will think that

17
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,070
high school is everything. It'll be

18
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,320
really hard for you to get past these

19
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,870
years because you'll quite frankly think

20
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,210
that you're an adult, know everything, but

21
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,460
you'll quickly realize that your life

22
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:53,070
hasn't even really started, and you have

23
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,079
so much potential to grow into an

24
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,239
independent woman. First heartbreak.

25
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,059
You'll fall in love and you'll have your

26
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:01,410
first heartbreak. You'll think that it is

27
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:03,510
the end of the world

28
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:06,450
and you'll truly believe that this

29
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:08,640
moment will never pass. You will move on.

30
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,790
You will get into other relationships,

31
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,100
and then you'll find that one person who

32
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,920
has been by your side this whole time

33
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:20,100
and be extremely, extremely happy with

34
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,890
him. Makeup. Stop wearing wild colors on

35
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:25,830
your eyelids with nude lipstick and

36
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:28,200
teased hair. It'll be fun for you to look

37
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,450
back on but trust me it's not a good

38
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,400
look. Listen to your parents. They only

39
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,560
want what's best for you and will only

40
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,380
give you advice that will help you

41
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,880
become a better person and essentially

42
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,829
give you the life that they have never

43
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,860
had. You'll bump heads with your dad

44
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:45,869
quite a lot but then you'll realize as

45
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,509
you get older that he's honestly

46
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:50,430
genuinely just looking out for you. You

47
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:52,200
guys will bond him more than ever and

48
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:55,079
you will be his daddy's little girl

49
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,090
again. Quality time. Spend as much time as

50
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:59,610
you can with your friends and family. As

51
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:02,070
you get older it'll get extremely hard

52
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:04,320
to coordinate time with your friends and

53
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,450
family so cherish those moments cherish

54
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,069
those free times that you have and spend

55
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,259
it with the people that you love. Don't

56
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:12,980
be a doormat. Stand up for yourself.

57
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:15,260
Because you get into an unhealthy relationship

58
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:17,150
you'll put your happiness aside and do

59
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,129
whatever makes the other person happy.

60
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:21,049
Don't worry eventually you will leave

61
00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:22,760
the relationship because you'll realize

62
00:02:21,049 --> 00:02:25,040
that your happiness is way more

63
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:27,769
important than sacrificing yourself. Take

64
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,349
care of your body. Stop eating the Papa

65
00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:33,920
John's Pizza at midnight. Stop going out

66
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:36,170
five days a week. You will gain 15 pounds.

67
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,750
You will start to learn to eat healthier,

68
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:40,909
get rid of those bad habits, and only eat

69
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:44,120
Oreos and Papa John's on occasions.

70
00:02:40,909 --> 00:02:46,909
Listen more and talk less. You have two

71
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:49,340
ears and one mouth. Listen twice as much

72
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:50,750
as you talk. Take more risks. You'll come

73
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,299
to find out that when you're in

74
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:55,579
uncomfortable, challenging positions you

75
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:56,359
grow the most. Just remember. If you're

76
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:57,950
complacent

77
00:02:56,359 --> 00:03:00,200
you're not challenging yourself to your

78
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:03,650
fullest potential. You will not have life

79
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:05,269
figured out and even turning 28 I still

80
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:07,760
don't feel like I have my life figured

81
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:10,639
out. Some days I'm super motivated and

82
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,159
other days I'm unenergized. So just take it

83
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:15,500
day by day and I promise you'll do great

84
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:18,139
things. Don't stress yourself out. While

85
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,909
stress is a part of life, just remember

86
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:22,040
that whatever you're stressing about at

87
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:24,049
that moment in time, you're probably not

88
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,180
going to be stressing about it a month

89
00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:28,340
or a year from now. You tend to be a

90
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:30,290
people pleaser, but that's okay because

91
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,909
you are really empathetic towards

92
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,829
other people's feelings and you're very

93
00:03:31,909 --> 00:03:35,720
cautious of what you say so that you

94
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:37,669
don't hurt other people's feelings. But

95
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:40,729
always remember you cannot please

96
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:42,650
everyone. A sure way to fail is trying to

97
00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:44,479
please everyone. So make sure to look out

98
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:46,359
for yourself. Don't get so caught up in

99
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:49,549
buying things. Fill your life with

100
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:52,250
experiences not things. You'll appreciate

101
00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:54,919
having stories to tell and not stuff to

102
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:57,709
show. Letting go. It's okay to let go of

103
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:59,569
people. Sometimes holding on causes more

104
00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:02,449
pain and more damage to yourself.

105
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:05,150
Lastly, love yourself. Social media

106
00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:06,979
becomes increasingly popular. Trust me.

107
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:09,439
You will compare yourself to other

108
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:11,409
people. Find love within yourself early

109
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:14,150
on and learn to appreciate what you have.

110
00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:16,340
Remember, no one can love you as much as

111
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:18,199
you can love yourself. So those are all

112
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:20,090
the advices that I would have loved to

113
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:21,829
give to my younger self. If you guys are

114
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:23,410
in your late teens or early 20s,

115
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:25,420
hopefully this can resonate

116
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:27,220
with you guys. And let me know down below

117
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:29,710
some advices that you would give to your

118
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:31,390
younger self. That wraps up this video. Thank

119
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:32,950
you guys so much for watching. I love you

120
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:35,400
guys so, so much and I'll talk to you

121
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,400
guys next time. Bye.
