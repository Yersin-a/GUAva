1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,370
That's when I started getting a lot of

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:08,700
like a racial derogatory comments about

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:12,000
being Asian. Hey guys welcome back to my

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:14,009
channel. I am Ray Lee here on YouTube.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,190
If you guys are new to my channel, hello.

6
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:19,230
But today I'm so excited to record this

7
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,240
video because I'm going to be talking to

8
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,970
you guys about my experience growing up

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,980
as an Asian American in America. I

10
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,529
stumbled across this video that Amy had

11
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:31,199
posted about growing up as a Korean

12
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:33,180
American. She is <unc> on YouTube.

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,300
I will link her video down below. I think

14
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,739
this topic is very common as far as like

15
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,750
the struggles. You know, growing up

16
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:40,739
especially if you have parents who don't

17
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,629
speak English,

18
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:43,980
who were immigrants, and I could create

19
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:45,660
like a whole nother video about like

20
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,550
growing up with immigrant parents. But

21
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:51,960
yeah. So I just wanted to take the time

22
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:53,969
to share my story with you guys and Amy

23
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,770
had created a bunch of questions, so

24
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:57,960
without further ado, let's get started. I

25
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,449
am a hundred percent Korean. I actually

26
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,969
was born in Korea. I was born in Kangnam

27
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:05,580
and I moved here when I was five years

28
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:08,430
old. My sister was 8 and both my parents

29
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,110
came out here as well. So we actually

30
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,610
moved out here for my dad's work and I

31
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:14,820
believe we were supposed to go back

32
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,229
after 3 years and you know live back in

33
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,930
Korea but we actually ended up staying

34
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:21,450
out here and I actually didn't know how

35
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:23,220
to say anything in English. I wasn't born

36
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,549
here and neither was my sister so

37
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:29,310
technically like we're not the first

38
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:31,799
generation. My kids would be first

39
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,810
generation but since I moved here when I

40
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,520
was so young I consider myself being a

41
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,250
first generation. So when my parents

42
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,369
decided to move to America we actually

43
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:43,049
moved to the San Gabriel Valley in

44
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:44,790
Southern California and if you guys

45
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:48,570
aren't familiar with that area there are

46
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:50,610
a ton of Asians. Granted I think when I

47
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:52,950
had moved there, there weren't that many

48
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,200
Asian people. I remember going into first

49
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,000
grade and there was one other Asian girl

50
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,909
in my class and I believe she was Korean.

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,640
And so my teacher paired us up together

52
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:06,090
so that she can like help me through the

53
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,160
school and she was so mean. Like I

54
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,330
remember she would like make fun of me

55
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,890
because I didn't know how to do like the

56
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,200
monkey bars because like that's not a

57
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:15,060
thing in Korea. I mean I don't

58
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,840
think it was. I don't know. And anyways I

59
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:21,720
don't think I had a lot of like bullying

60
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,610
because I was Asian even though I was

61
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,560
completely a minority at the time. I

62
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,239
think progressively as a years went by

63
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,069
there were more and more Asians that

64
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:30,690
would attend my school. But I do remember

65
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:32,850
in elementary school

66
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:34,800
like my grandmother, because she also

67
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:37,620
moved out here to raise us for a little

68
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,470
bit. So my grandmother made me Korean

69
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,540
sushi which is called kimbap and it's

70
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:45,930
freaking bomb. But I remember like I

71
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:47,610
opened my lunch pail and, at school, and

72
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,810
everyone was like oh my gosh, like what

73
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:51,630
are you eating, like that looks

74
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:53,670
disgusting, like all this stuff. And so

75
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,959
similar to the show fresh off the boat

76
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,700
if you guys have watched that before.

77
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,459
Like there's an instance in there where

78
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,870
like the character is eating I think like

79
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:02,220
black bean noodles or something and then

80
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,870
like everyone's like, ew he's

81
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:06,360
eating worms or like whatever. And I

82
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:09,150
remember going back home and just being

83
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,040
super sad and essentially just like

84
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,870
telling my family that like I only

85
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,819
wanted like Lunchables because that was

86
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:17,100
like the cool thing. I just remember like

87
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:18,660
food was als- just a big thing that like made

88
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,700
me feel really like embarrassed

89
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,709
embarrassed about being like Korean

90
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,709
because I also remember. You know those

91
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:27,480
food drives that schools do so that you

92
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:29,670
could like donate the food during like

93
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,940
the holidays and stuff. And I remember my

94
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:34,890
dad gave me this box of chocopie. And chocopie

95
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,359
was my favorite dessert and like I

96
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:38,100
still love it to this day but it's

97
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:39,810
basically a chocolate cake with like

98
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,070
marshmallow in the middle and it's just

99
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:43,140
delicious.

100
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:45,239
And I remember my dad had given that to

101
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,620
me so that I could drop that off during

102
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:49,590
my food drive and I was so embarrassed

103
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:52,109
that like I wasn't coming to school with

104
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:53,940
like a can of peas and a can of corn, and Here

105
00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:59,220
I am like walking around with like a box

106
00:03:53,940 --> 00:04:00,510
of chocopie. And I remember like running to the place

107
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,459
the drop-off place and like just dropping and like running back

108
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:04,500
because I didn't want people to see that

109
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:06,840
like I had dropped off this like weird

110
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,269
dessert. But I will say like the biggest

111
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,400
time that I had like this huge Epiphany

112
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:13,829
of like oh my gosh I'm a minority was

113
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,639
when I went to college. I went to college

114
00:04:13,829 --> 00:04:19,380
in Illinois. That was like the biggest

115
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:22,979
culture shock for me because that's when

116
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:24,240
I finally realized that I was Asian. Like

117
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:26,250
an Asian American.

118
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,669
That's when I started getting a lot of

119
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:33,270
like racial derogatory comments about

120
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:35,039
being Asian. And it was like, it wasn't

121
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,720
even like hurtful. Like it was just it

122
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:38,400
would just make me so mad that like

123
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,400
there are people out there who are so

124
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,130
ignorant. And I remember like a friend of

125
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,509
mine actually came and visited from um

126
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:46,800
California and we were just like walking

127
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:49,190
across the street and this was pretty

128
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,509
late at night. It was like when um I think like

129
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:53,460
when the bars were closing or something

130
00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:56,009
like that. And I remember people yelling

131
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:58,229
like go back to your country. Like you

132
00:04:56,009 --> 00:05:00,300
don't belong here. And like saying like

133
00:04:58,229 --> 00:05:02,160
ching chong whatever. Like all this stuff.

134
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,710
And I was just like I cannot believe I

135
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,720
go to a school where like you know if I

136
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:08,070
saw these students at school they

137
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,560
probably wouldn't say anything but the

138
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:12,449
fact that they could hide behind um. And

139
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,340
they were actually in a car so, you know,

140
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:15,870
they could hide behind just like saying

141
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,340
that while they drive past. You know

142
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:19,830
that's when I realized like oh my gosh like I

143
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:22,199
I'm not white. And I mean clearly. But like I I I'm I'm

144
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:23,909
different. By the time that I went to

145
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:26,520
high school my high school had a

146
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:27,990
thousand students in just my graduating

147
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,240
class. So there was four thousand

148
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:34,409
students at my school and I want to say

149
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:37,740
like at least 70 percent were Asians. So

150
00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:39,659
I always felt like I belonged and I like

151
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,370
belong to as like an Asian. I don't know

152
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:44,039
necessarily if I ever thought like oh my

153
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:46,620
gosh like Korean pride because um I

154
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:47,880
don't know I just never felt like any of

155
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,409
us we're like oh my gosh like Chinese

156
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,430
pride Koran pride like Mexican pride or

157
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:52,199
anything like that. We just kind of like

158
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,669
all got along really well. I don't know

159
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:56,250
sometimes like I feel like I would be

160
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:59,159
embarrassed to talk in Korean in like a

161
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:00,810
public setting, but as I've gotten older

162
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:02,849
like I just don't care, and I'm proud to

163
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:04,770
be Korean. So you know I'll talk to my

164
00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:06,509
parents in Korean, and anytime that I can

165
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:10,740
I try to because I don't want to lose

166
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:14,880
the fact that um I am Korean. One was that

167
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:17,310
obviously Asians are smart. And I'm the

168
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,630
second child. My older sister is the

169
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,400
brains of the family and I'm like

170
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:21,960
completely okay saying that. My sister

171
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,389
went to an Ivy League school. She was

172
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,880
su- she was and is super super smart.

173
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:29,130
She's a doctor. Like I definitely did not

174
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,509
take that route and I felt like that was

175
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:32,099
a little bit hard for me because I

176
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:33,990
remember in high school because there

177
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:36,040
were so many Asians at my school

178
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:38,440
everyone I felt like every

179
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:40,960
was so smart and I remember everyone

180
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:43,030
taking like AP courses and people were

181
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,430
applying to like UCLA I was like a back

182
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:48,520
up school which like I couldn't even get

183
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:50,590
into UCLA so to me I was just like oh my

184
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:53,470
gosh like these people are so freakin

185
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:56,050
smart. And I always felt like even though

186
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:58,630
you know I did take AP classes and stuff,

187
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:02,710
I wasn't like in the top tier of like

188
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:04,150
super brainiacs. And I don't know. Like I

189
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:06,670
always wanted to like I always grow up

190
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:08,110
like wanting to take dance lessons so I

191
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:10,180
started like cheerleading when I was

192
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:11,800
like in the third grade, I like attended

193
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,930
drill team I was in the drill team all

194
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,670
throughout middle school, and um took

195
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:17,980
dance classes like throughout high

196
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:20,500
school, and I just felt like I wasn't

197
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:23,110
like the stereotypical Asian. I felt like

198
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:25,510
I was forced to take on these

199
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:27,610
stereotypes. Like for instance I played

200
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:30,100
piano growing up, I played cello growing

201
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:32,530
up. I think as I've grown older I've

202
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:36,280
realized that like yes some of those

203
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:38,830
stereotypes are true but I don't have to

204
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:41,590
be a hundred percent of those like

205
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:43,260
stereotypes and it's okay to not feel

206
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:46,960
like you have to be like completely like

207
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:48,700
extremely smart. And um you know like people are

208
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,680
like oh you're like super loud and

209
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,030
you're like very vocal. It's like not

210
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,320
very Asian of you. And it's like well

211
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:57,100
what does that even mean you know.

212
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:58,990
So I think you know like I struggled

213
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:01,360
with it in the beginning like as a child

214
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:03,220
but as I've gotten older I just don't

215
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,530
care. And honestly like some of those

216
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:08,710
stereotypes like I fit into. I'm Asian

217
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:10,270
and I love to save money. I don't like to

218
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:13,330
spend money on things that I don't have

219
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:14,980
to. And you know if that's me being Asian

220
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:17,470
then so be it.

221
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:20,290
I can speak Korean but because I moved

222
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:22,570
here when I was five I have like the

223
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:25,330
capacity of like a five year old. Which

224
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:27,430
is really sad. So I can talk to my

225
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:30,610
parents about just like basic things but

226
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:32,979
I can't talk to them about like politics

227
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:34,479
or things going around like in the news

228
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:36,550
and stuff. So that's a little bit

229
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,650
frustrating. My hopes is that when I have

230
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:40,060
a kid that they learn to speak Korean too.

231
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:41,680
Like I want my parents to speak Korean

232
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:44,470
to them. I think it's just really, really

233
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,660
important to keep my Korean culture

234
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:48,060
alive. And so yeah.

235
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:52,070
Growing up with parents

236
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:55,950
who did not speak English very fluently

237
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:59,100
was such a struggle for me. Especially in

238
00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:01,290
like my teens, I felt like I could not

239
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:03,660
communicate with my parents at all. I

240
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:07,140
wasn't like the best in my teens. I think

241
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:09,600
I was just like a brat and I feel so bad for

242
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:12,960
my parents, especially my dad, because I

243
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,270
clashed with him so much. Like he and I

244
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,860
were so, so different I think we didn't

245
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:18,750
have a lot of like common ground. And I

246
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,600
think as a teen it's really hard for you

247
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:23,310
to like communicate in general and have

248
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,779
this like open dialogue with your

249
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:27,029
parents because you think like your

250
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:28,589
parents are like the biggest enemies. So

251
00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:30,270
that was just like really difficult for

252
00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:32,520
me. I remember like we used to yell at

253
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:34,020
each other and um I felt like it was just

254
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:37,500
like never gonna go away

255
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:40,200
but honestly I think um you know growing up

256
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:43,290
I've I've learned to be A less of a brat

257
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,790
right and B just understand like where

258
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:46,320
my parents are coming from because at

259
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:48,060
the end of the day the reason why we

260
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,540
were like having these like screaming matches

261
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:53,670
is because I clearly wasn't doing what

262
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:55,530
they wanted would be like the best for

263
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:57,750
me. As I've gotten older I've gotten even

264
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:59,970
more and more close -er to my dad and like

265
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:03,750
honestly I'm like a daddy's little girl.

266
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:07,020
And um it it's I think it was a lot of

267
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:09,690
obviously like me learning that you know

268
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:11,760
my parents aren't there as like somebody

269
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:13,290
who's trying to make my life worse. Like

270
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,850
if anything like they're trying to make

271
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:16,320
my life way better than they you know

272
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:20,430
the experiences that they had growing up.

273
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:22,530
I am so proud to be Korean and not even

274
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:24,420
Korean but just like Asian American. I

275
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:25,800
lived in Illinois. I went to school there

276
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,750
and then I actually lived in Minnesota

277
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:30,570
for a little bit and I also lived in DC

278
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:33,930
for a little bit. And I think being in

279
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:36,290
the Midwest I was able to kind of like

280
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:38,520
educate other people about being

281
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:40,950
asian-american. Since I couldn't like

282
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,870
obviously like teach my friends you know

283
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:45,630
Korean I would try to like introduce

284
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:47,839
them to food because I think that's just

285
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:50,790
like. Eating is such a great way to

286
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,440
experience another culture. There's so

287
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:55,050
much tradition and so much culture

288
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,760
behind food so we're trying to introduce

289
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:59,220
a lot of my friends who obviously

290
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,630
weren't familiar with like Asians with

291
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,120
food. I feel like any time

292
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:05,460
I have like the chance to kind of just

293
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,010
open doors for other people to like

294
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:11,190
enjoy and like experience a different

295
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:13,440
side of like America then I do it

296
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:15,870
through food. One of my favorite things

297
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,120
about being an Asian American and Korean

298
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:21,450
American is the fact that we're very

299
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,980
very family-oriented. I think that my

300
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:26,700
parents were a little bit different in

301
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:29,670
the fact that a lot of Korean parents

302
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:31,050
don't say I love you to their kids. Or I

303
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:32,310
don't only think like Asian parents

304
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:34,880
really saying I love you to their kids.

305
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:36,930
It's not very common but my parents

306
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,760
literally would tell me that every

307
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:41,100
single day. Like to this day when I

308
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:44,730
talked to my parents or my sister on the

309
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:46,410
phone we always say I love you. When I go

310
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:48,390
to bed I always say good night and I

311
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:51,210
love you to my dad. That's not as common

312
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:53,250
but I think the family oriented part is

313
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,720
very very common because I grew up with

314
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,220
my grandmother and I had the chance to

315
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,070
grow up with my grandmother. In the

316
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:01,260
Korean culture grandmothers take a

317
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:04,050
really big pride in raising their

318
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:06,720
grandkids. So my grandmother and I like.

319
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:08,970
She was my best friend and I'm so, so

320
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,800
happy that that was like part of my my

321
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:13,440
childhood. And another thing that I love

322
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,900
about being korean-american is the fact

323
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,970
that we really, really appreciate our

324
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,890
elders. From a very young age you're

325
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:21,660
taught to be very respectful of your

326
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:23,820
elders which I think could be like a pro

327
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:25,590
and a con because there's a lot of like

328
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,820
authority and stuff like that ,but just

329
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:29,580
like you know if you think of like the

330
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:31,440
good parts of it. In Korean there's

331
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:34,770
actually different ways that you say

332
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:38,370
words if someone is like of your peer or

333
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:39,780
someone who is higher than you. So. And by

334
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:42,840
higher than you I mean like older than

335
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:45,870
you. When you say the word like hi for a

336
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:47,820
friend you say annyeong_cs but when you say it

337
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:50,070
to an older person you say annyeonghaseyo_cs.

338
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,360
So there's like two different ways of

339
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:53,580
saying it and I think that's pretty

340
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,140
similar in Spanish too which is like usted

341
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,850
I think. I don't know. I could

342
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,920
totally be making that up. I took Spanish

343
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:00,590
for like eight years in my life and I

344
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:03,270
don't think I remember like anything.

345
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:05,520
Lastly I know I talk about food a lot

346
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:06,780
but I think it's because that was a big

347
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:09,650
part of my childhood.

348
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:11,700
From like traumatizing to you know

349
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:13,779
educating other people with food. But

350
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,939
like honestly I love Korean food.

351
00:13:13,779 --> 00:13:17,439
I know this was a super long video but I

352
00:13:15,939 --> 00:13:19,029
feel like I got super caught up talking

353
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:21,129
about my childhood. I'd love hearing

354
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:22,930
about how people grow up because I think

355
00:13:21,129 --> 00:13:25,509
it says a lot about like who you are

356
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:26,920
right now. But anyways I hope you guys

357
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:28,660
like this video and if you did make sure

358
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,980
to give this video big thumbs up. Thank

359
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,509
