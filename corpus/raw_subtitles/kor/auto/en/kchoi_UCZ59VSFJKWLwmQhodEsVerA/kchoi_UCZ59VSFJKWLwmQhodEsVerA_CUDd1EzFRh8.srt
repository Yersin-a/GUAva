00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,170
hi I'm Kate Roy welcome back to my

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,450
channel I know that it's been like three

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,280
months since I've uploaded a video I've

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:17,310
just been really busy with work but I

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,260
finally had a free morning to film and I

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,390
really miss filming and editing even

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,340
when it's just like a sit down video

9
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,980
today I thought that I would do the

10
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,269
Asian American tag which I believe was

11
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,119
started by Amy

12
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:32,700
aka vagabond Hughes and I've actually

13
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:35,190
wanted to do this type of video since I

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,739
saw Wei Lee upload one called growing up

15
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,450
Chinese American I will link both of the

16
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:41,100
videos I just mentioned in the

17
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,620
description box so I've had like a

18
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,120
running note in my phone of just my

19
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,640
thoughts on this topic

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,520
but I thought instead I would just do

21
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,710
the tag to help structure the video a

22
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,840
little better so let's just begin which

23
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:57,239
ethnicity are you I am Korean I've

24
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,370
actually gotten comments of people who

25
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:01,320
didn't know that I was Korean which I

26
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:04,920
thought was weird like I thought Choi

27
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,110
was mostly a Korean last name but yeah

28
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,869
Korean which generation are you I am

29
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:12,240
second generation so my dad moved to the

30
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:15,090
US when he was eight so he's actually

31
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,070
pretty Americanized or he's just

32
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,680
completely Americanized I've heard that

33
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:21,270
being called 1.5 generation because even

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,479
though he is a first generation

35
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:26,189
immigrant he pretty much acts like he

36
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,409
was born here because he came here when

37
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:31,350
he was so young so my dad moved when he

38
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:34,829
was young he's like 1.5 generation my

39
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:36,450
mom moved after college after my dad and

40
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:38,189
my mom got married so she is

41
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:41,369
first-generation a first-generation

42
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:43,290
immigrant and I am second generation

43
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:45,030
what is the first experience where you

44
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,369
felt different I think it was pretty

45
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:50,070
early on because my elementary school

46
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:53,329
didn't have a lot of Koreans let alone

47
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:56,490
Asians I can remember maybe two other

48
00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:58,259
Asians in my school in elementary school

49
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,420
two of my closest friends one of them

50
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:02,850
had blond hair and blue eyes and the

51
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,460
other one had like light brown hair and

52
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,879
hazel eyes and I was always really

53
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,429
jealous that they had such beautiful

54
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:12,829
pretty eye colors and

55
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:15,709
I think one of the earliest memories I

56
00:02:12,829 --> 00:02:17,599
have a feeling different is being in the

57
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:19,730
bathroom together because girls go to

58
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,680
the bathroom together and we were

59
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:24,079
washing her hands and I remember looking

60
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,450
in the mirror that was above the sinks

61
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:28,849
and just not wanting to look at my face

62
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:32,180
and if that sounds really dramatic and

63
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:36,409
sad when I say it that way but it was

64
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:40,250
just I saw how big and pretty their eyes

65
00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:43,010
were and how like slim their faces were

66
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:45,200
as you probably know Asians typically

67
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:48,230
have flatter faces with a lower nose

68
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:51,200
bridge and with monolids instead of

69
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:54,500
double eyelids or an eyelid crease so

70
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,209
just seeing the difference in our faces

71
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,919
I was really uncomfortable and just

72
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:59,959
didn't want to look at that I wouldn't

73
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:01,879
say that was an ongoing struggle but it

74
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:05,120
was something that I would be reminded

75
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:06,950
of here and there and be like oh right I

76
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,419
look different than most of my friends

77
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:10,639
were you always proud of your heritage

78
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:12,019
or was there a time when you rejected it

79
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:13,250
I wouldn't say I've ever rejected my

80
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:15,650
heritage there were definitely times

81
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:18,290
when I was embarrassed by it one time in

82
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:21,169
elementary school I think like my mom

83
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:23,510
was picking me up from school and so I

84
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:26,780
was like coming out the gate and she

85
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:29,449
like wasn't noticing me and so I was

86
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:31,639
gonna call out to her but I was

87
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:33,829
embarrassed to say oma because everyone

88
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:37,129
else they say mom mommy

89
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:39,379
and um just sounds weird and foreign so

90
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:41,359
I remember not feeling very proud in

91
00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:43,099
that moment I was also always

92
00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:45,979
self-conscious of my middle name because

93
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:47,629
my middle name is my Korean name and my

94
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:52,159
friends in school their middle names

95
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:55,220
were like Kimberly and Erin and mine was

96
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:58,849
weird so that was also something that I

97
00:03:55,220 --> 00:04:02,269
was really aware of and embarrassed by

98
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:03,739
and I just wanted a normal middle name

99
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:05,329
what are some stereotypes that you

100
00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:08,060
struggle with I think the only

101
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:09,979
stereotype I struggle with right now is

102
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:12,650
that Asian women are bad drivers

103
00:04:09,979 --> 00:04:15,560
whenever I make any sort of mistake I

104
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:18,199
just feel like oh god I hope they don't

105
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,570
see me and then you know I'm just adding

106
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:23,120
to this stereotype of Asian women being

107
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:24,889
bad drivers so that is something I

108
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,430
always thinking about when I'm driving

109
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:30,410
I've had a couple times recently where I

110
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:33,530
was talking to somebody for the first

111
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:36,919
time and they commented on how good my

112
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:40,190
English was so I guess there's that

113
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:42,740
stereotype still of Asians all being

114
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:43,940
foreigners so that's something that I

115
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,730
don't struggle with on a day-to-day

116
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:49,220
basis but it does pop up here and there

117
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:52,190
can you speak your language Kumar sees

Seungyeon sir tell Sunita how has being

125
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,280
asian-american affected your

126
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:13,730
relationship with your parents I know a

127
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:16,340
lot of people my age who have parents

128
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:18,350
that immigrated to the u.s. together

129
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:20,630
they often struggle with a language

130
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:23,360
barrier I feel very fortunate that I

131
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:25,040
don't struggle with that as much

132
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,130
I definitely don't struggle with that

133
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:30,410
with my dad my mom is you know there's a

134
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:32,750
bit of a barrier there but it's still

135
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:35,870
like she's lived in the States for quite

136
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:38,930
a long time and also because my friends

137
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:41,060
in elementary school weren't Asian so my

138
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:44,120
mom's friends who are my friend's moms

139
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:46,640
they also weren't Asian so it's been you

140
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:49,280
know a long time of her coming out of

141
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:51,640
that comfort zone speaking Korean I

142
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,289
think just on my end as I grow older I

143
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:56,600
feel much more grateful for the

144
00:05:54,289 --> 00:06:00,590
struggles that my parents have been

145
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:04,820
through in order to to raise me and give

146
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:08,180
me a good life with a good education and

147
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:11,090
a great family environment so I think

148
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,890
that's something just like on my end it

149
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:15,140
has affected my relationship with my

150
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:17,180
parents in terms of me being more

151
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,800
grateful as I grow older and realized

152
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,900
that more and more and that's not just

153
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,539
for Asian Americans I think that goes

154
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:25,220
for all people who have parents that are

155
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:28,340
immigrants there's that level of

156
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,900
gratitude that you you know you build as

157
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,880
you grow older how do you feel about

158
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,590
your heritage now and do you identify

159
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,090
with it I talked about how at my

160
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,070
elementary school there were only like

161
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,780
two other Asians

162
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:39,970
my school but by the time I got to

163
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:42,760
middle school in high school there were

164
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:44,230
Koreans and Asians everywhere and I

165
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:47,530
started to feel much more comfortable

166
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:50,230
and in college I was really involved in

167
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:53,260
my church fellowship and it was pretty

168
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:55,570
much all Korean so I was I went from

169
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:58,000
like when I was younger like not being

170
00:06:55,570 --> 00:07:00,460
surrounded by any Asians to just

171
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,410
completely being surrounded by Asians

172
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:04,060
and mostly Koreans there are times when

173
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:08,110
I'm self-conscious of that and I'm aware

174
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:09,910
of my friend group being mostly people

175
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:12,010
who look like me and have a similar

176
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:15,250
background when I am with friends who

177
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:17,320
aren't Korean or Asian I am very proud

178
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,970
of my heritage and I do try to bring it

179
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,830
out and I teach them about it I would

180
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:22,390
say that now I've come to a place where

181
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:24,400
I am proud of it there are times when

182
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:26,650
I'm self-conscious that most of my

183
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,950
friends are Korean and I want to branch

184
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:31,240
out more but overall I'm very proud that

185
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:35,020
wasn't the question it was do I identify

186
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:37,570
with it and I do identify with it I

187
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:41,050
think korean-american is like a specific

188
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:44,770
community compared to Korean and the

189
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:47,080
American and I do strongly identify with

190
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:49,660
that korean-american part of me of

191
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,250
taking things from both sides what is

192
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:52,990
your favorite thing about being

193
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:56,260
asian-american basically what I just

194
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:58,720
said of how I can take aspects from my

195
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:00,760
Korean culture and then from the

196
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:05,380
American culture which is already like a

197
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:07,180
mishmash of a bunch of cultures and have

198
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:09,460
that be my identity I love that I can

199
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:12,730
speak Korean I love Korean food I love

200
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:14,800
visiting Korea and slowly learning more

201
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:17,980
about Korea's history because admittedly

202
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:21,130
I don't know too much about it but just

203
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:25,270
knowing the resilience of my people or

204
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:27,160
the peat my ancestors is amazing and I

205
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:30,040
love that I'm American too and that I

206
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:32,469
can claim that as my identity and I love

207
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:34,990
specifically like being from Los Angeles

208
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:36,700
and the culture that comes with that so

209
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:39,580
my favorite thing would be all the

210
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:43,150
things just being able to combine all of

211
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:44,950
that and that is what being American is

212
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:47,020
really and being asian-american that's

213
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,550
it for this video I hope you enjoyed and

214
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,500
I hope

215
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:51,120
thought you could relate to some of the

216
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,790
things that I was saying let me know in

217
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,680

00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:57,750

00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:07,079
lives in Korea right now and we actually

223
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:08,940
met in London because she was doing an

224
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:12,240
internship there and you would have seen

225
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:14,160
her in my previous video of what I ate

226
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,820
in Korea she uploads vlogs and other

227
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:20,040
lifestyle content right now related to

228
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,660
her living in Korea but she has some

229
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,209
videos also from when she was in London

230
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,500

232
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:30,450
