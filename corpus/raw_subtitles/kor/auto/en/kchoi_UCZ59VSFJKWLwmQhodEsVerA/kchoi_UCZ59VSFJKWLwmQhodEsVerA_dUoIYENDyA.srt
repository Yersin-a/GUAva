00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,570
hi I'm Kate Roy welcome back to my

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,359
channel as you can see I am sitting on

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:08,460
the floor in front of my office setup

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:10,590
here it's where I have been spending a

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,540
lot of time since I've started working

6
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,730
from home and social distancing myself

7
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:18,119
and I have a list of a few videos that I

8
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:20,640
plan to film this weekend and just when

9
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:21,869
I have time in the evenings now that I'm

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,670
not going to be going out for a little

11
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:25,980
bit I know that the assumptions tag is

12
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,840
pretty old the trend has kind of come

13
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,060
and gone but I still wanted to do it

14
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,279
because I do have quite a lot of new

15
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,829
subscribers and I don't have too many

16
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,540
videos that are about me so hopefully

17
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:38,160
this can help you get to know me a

18
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,719
little bit better before we dive in if

19
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,480
you want to see videos about consulting

20
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:45,270
career and travel then hit the subscribe

21
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,680
button as well as a notification belt so

22
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,289
you know when I have any video coming

23
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,600
out as usual I went to Instagram to get

24
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:54,870
your submissions for your assumptions

25
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,120
about me and I went ahead and copied

26
00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:00,539
them or typed them into a note on my

27
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,930
phone and categorized some of them so

28
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:05,610
there were two really big themes that

29
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,890
came up one was around general

30
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,020
motivation and discipline and another

31
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,490
one was about school and academics and

32
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,979
then there were some just other

33
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:16,290
miscellaneous assumptions so the one

34
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:18,150
that had kin the most assumptions around

35
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,220
it was again around motivation and

36
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,960
discipline so you've got your

37
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,250
together you're diligent do you have

38
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,439
your life together you're a self

39
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,900
disciplined person you're efficient and

40
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,060
productive they all kind of seem to fit

41
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,430
in together I do feel like on the

42
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,490
outside it appears that way because I

43
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:37,350
also appear to be a pretty calm person

44
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,329
on the outside and I'm sure I've talked

45
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:42,360
about this in some videos in the past

46
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:45,540
just like in passing but I come off as a

47
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:48,149
pretty cool calm collected type of

48
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,790
person but I'm actually the opposite

49
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:52,799
like I'm very anxious and paranoid all

50
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:55,259
the time and always overthinking things

51
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,110
but I think I just do a good job at

52
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:01,079
hiding it so I feel like with that it

53
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:03,780
can appear like I have all of my ish

54
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:08,429
together all the time but I definitely

55
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:10,860
have days that I feel so unmotivated so

56
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:12,090
lazy like even last night I was like you

57
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,870
know what I'm gonna go to sleep early

58
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,299
I'm gonna wake

59
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:18,239
early go for a run I ended up watching

60
00:02:15,299 --> 00:02:21,060
YouTube videos until like 1:30 a.m. and

61
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,069
I have not gone for a run today and it

62
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,810
is like 6:00 p.m. right now and I'm

63
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:27,569
filming this YouTube video when I had

64
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:30,510
ambitions to film a couple today so I

65
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:33,269
think on the whole yes I skew more

66
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:35,579
towards being pretty disciplined and

67
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:38,010
motivated but it doesn't mean that I

68
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:39,959
don't have really really off days

69
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:41,519
another assumption that's sort of

70
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:43,739
related but there's kind of an

71
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,230
additional assumption added on to it was

72
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:49,109
you work hard but you also earn a lot

73
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:51,269
with several OS there I mean I think on

74
00:02:49,109 --> 00:02:55,440
average like if you look at the average

75
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:58,019
salary across America then sure I earn

76
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,269
more than average but I don't think it's

77
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:02,909
as much as some of you might think of

78
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:05,099
course what a lot of money means or what

79
00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:07,200
a large salary means depends on so many

80
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:09,629
different factors I work in the states

81
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,790
where the standard of living and the pay

82
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:13,709
just tends to be higher in general so

83
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:16,260
there's that I also work in consulting

84
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:19,079
where the salary tends to be higher than

85
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,430
that of let's say teaching just as an

86
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:22,980
example but compared to some of the

87
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:24,780
people that I know I what I'm making

88
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:27,269
might have been what some people started

89
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,169
making when they graduated college so it

90
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:32,370
is all relative

91
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:35,190
I live comfortably and I'm able to you

92
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:37,410
know get everything that I need so I'm

93
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:40,739
not saying that I don't earn a lot in

94
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:42,750
general or had all but I maybe it's not

95
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:44,639
as high as what you're assuming so the

96
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,769
other big bucket of assumptions had to

97
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,750
do with school and academics so starting

98
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:52,049
with I think that you were an A student

99
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:55,079
in school I was before college in

100
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:57,269
college I was not an A student I got I

101
00:03:55,079 --> 00:04:00,419
got better like as the semester went by

102
00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:03,299
but I remember getting like a c-minus on

103
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:06,150
an English paper during my first year of

104
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:08,669
college and that was a very humbling

105
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:12,180
moment for me so I'm not like on here to

106
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:14,940
brag about anything but yes I did

107
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:17,970
try very hard at school and was able to

108
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:19,380
get good grades you know throughout high

109
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,549
school and all of that I don't really

110
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,620
think I had too much of a social life

111
00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:24,900
like my social life was made up of my

112
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,790
extracurricular activities like swimming

113
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:29,420
and piano

114
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:32,790
things like that when I got to college I

115
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:33,330
didn't try as hard as I did in high

116
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,460
school

117
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:37,950
I still managed to get pretty decent

118
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,840
grades just was not a straight-a student

119
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:43,350
in college it was when I went to grad

120
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,900
school that I really tried hard and that

121
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:48,300
of course is when I really started my

122
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:50,460
channel or started uploading frequently

123
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,590
to my channel so I had a lot of vlogs

124
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:54,390
where I would go and study or go write

125
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:55,980
for my dissertation so I can definitely

126
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:58,140
see where that assumption comes from

127
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,100
this one I thought was funny I hope from

128
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:02,280
the sound of your voice

129
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:05,760
I thought you are 30 in a good way well

130
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:09,150
I am 29 so I am close to 30 and I'm

131
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:10,800
excited to be 30 so yeah I think I do

132
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:15,360
take it in a good way very conservative

133
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:17,850
I actually I struggle with this I think

134
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,470
I am actually socially pretty liberal I

135
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:21,720
grew up in Los Angeles which is very

136
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:23,820
diverse and also the high school that I

137
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,340
went to was pretty liberal and I was

138
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:29,600
part of a humanities program where we

139
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:32,640
studied philosophy art history and our

140
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:37,170
11th grade year we actually had like

141
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:39,780
units about racism sexism classism etc

142
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:43,830
so I feel like early on I was introduced

143
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:45,870
to very liberal social perspectives and

144
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:48,330
issues but I would say because of my

145
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:52,170
Korean upbringing because of course I

146
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:54,420
was raised both Korean and American I am

147
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:56,490
still conservative about other things

148
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:59,040
you're a picky eater I don't think I'm a

149
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:02,520
picky eater at all like I will try

150
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:04,260
anything once the thing that I am picky

151
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,400
about is that I really don't like

152
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:08,700
crustaceans

153
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:10,950
so like shrimp crab etc I'm actually not

154
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:13,830
100% sure of shrimp as a crustacean but

155
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:16,740
anyway basically things that look like

156
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:19,020
bugs in the ocean now I don't mind

157
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:21,900
having like a lobster mac and cheese or

158
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:24,780
like crab cakes or like a crab hand roll

159
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:26,400
like it's not the meat of the crustacean

160
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:28,140
or shellfish that's what shrimp is

161
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,730
shellfish so I know literally nobody

162
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:31,920
cares about this but I had to get to the

163
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:33,720
bottom of it so I looked up what is

164
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:36,270
considered a crustacean and it seems

165
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,850
like shrimp actually are considered

166
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,849
crustaceans so then I was like why did I

167
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:41,439
always think that

168
00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:43,110
shrimp were shellfish and then I saw

169
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:46,949
that shellfish is actually an umbrella

170
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:49,119
term for a crustacean or Crustacea and

171
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:51,219
mollusks so again not that anybody cares

172
00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:53,199
but just thought that I would clear that

173
00:06:51,219 --> 00:06:55,629
up so I'm not spreading false

174
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,149
information out there about shellfish

175
00:06:55,629 --> 00:07:00,069
and crustaceans because that's obviously

176
00:06:58,149 --> 00:07:02,349
very important it's not the meat of it

177
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:03,819
that I don't like it's like I don't like

178
00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:08,529
it when I have to freaking use like

179
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:10,659
pliers to open up my crab leg and get

180
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:14,019
like a little sliver of meat and also

181
00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:18,099
with seafood and shellfish usually it's

182
00:07:14,019 --> 00:07:20,259
like the butter or like the lemon or the

183
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:21,969
like Cajun seasoning that is actually

184
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:23,860
the tasty part of it so I just don't

185
00:07:21,969 --> 00:07:26,769
really eat too much seafood I never

186
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:29,019
crave it but it's not like I won't eat

187
00:07:26,769 --> 00:07:30,759
it it's just not gonna be my choice but

188
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:32,860
other than that I don't think I'm picky

189
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:35,169
at all I used to not like mushrooms now

190
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:38,349
I love them used to hate olives love

191
00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:41,349
them so I think you know as I grew older

192
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:43,269
I acquired more tastes and became less

193
00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:45,939
and less picky over time sort of on a

194
00:07:43,269 --> 00:07:50,110
like related note another one was health

195
00:07:45,939 --> 00:07:52,029
conscious and I in general yes I think

196
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:54,430
I'm health conscious but I there was a

197
00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:56,949
period of my life where I was pretty

198
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:59,499
strict about what I ate if you look back

199
00:07:56,949 --> 00:08:02,319
on my channel I have lots of vegan and

200
00:07:59,499 --> 00:08:05,259
plant-based recipe videos because for

201
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:08,289
about two years maybe I was really

202
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:10,089
really into eating plant-based and Whole

203
00:08:08,289 --> 00:08:11,199
Foods and all of that and that was a

204
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:12,999
great time of my life

205
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,889
I saved a lot of money when I was living

206
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:17,949
in London and cooking only plant-based

207
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:20,649
meals I felt great you know all of that

208
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:22,929
but it got to be a little bit difficult

209
00:08:20,649 --> 00:08:24,669
to maintain which you know you could say

210
00:08:22,929 --> 00:08:27,789
it's just lack of motivation or

211
00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:31,569
something but I still do you know try to

212
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:32,620
be try to eat less me to try to eat less

213
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:35,079
dairy and all of that

214
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:37,269
I just don't restrict myself anymore

215
00:08:35,079 --> 00:08:40,870
it's also harder you know when I travel

216
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:42,610
for work to be so you know strict with

217
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:45,160
my with my eating because you don't

218
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:45,610
always have too many options but I do my

219
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,100
best

220
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:51,189
I am health-conscious I do try to

221
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:52,560
exercise regularly since I grew up being

222
00:08:51,189 --> 00:08:56,340
a swimmer and

223
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:58,800
late so I I do my best but it's it's not

224
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:02,730
like I don't have any like really strict

225
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,770
regiment regimen regimen around my diet

226
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:07,320
or my exercise that you didn't go to

227
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:10,920
church so that's actually kind of true

228
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:13,110
so I grew up when I was younger I went

229
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,640
to this church my family went to this

230
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:16,920
church and it was actually like almost

231
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,180
an hour away from our house because we

232
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,520
went there because it was like my

233
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:22,140
cousin's family's Church or not their

234
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,750
church but they attended that church so

235
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:26,910
I grew up going there from like when I

236
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:28,350
was like in first grade to like fifth

237
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:30,150
grade so let's just say through

238
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:32,490
elementary school then I started to take

239
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:35,070
too much of a toll on our family to be

240
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:37,560
going that far every single week every

241
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:39,690
single Sunday so we stopped and then

242
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,300
sort of like hopped around at a few

243
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:44,580
churches near where we lived but I

244
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,410
pretty much stopped going to church like

245
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:48,420
through middle school from middle school

246
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:51,330
through high school part of that was

247
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:53,730
it's just hard to like find a community

248
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:55,260
to fit in with I was really busy with a

249
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:57,540
lot of other things you know like

250
00:09:55,260 --> 00:10:00,000
extracurriculars like I mentioned and

251
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:01,710
when I was in high school I just was

252
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,470
against going to church however when I

253
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:07,380
went to college I decided to join a

254
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:08,850
fellowship a church fellowship I went

255
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:11,610
with some of my friends from high school

256
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:13,680
who were in college with me who are at

257
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:15,000
Berkeley with me we decided to join a

258
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,830
fellowship together that's when I

259
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,460
started going to church again regularly

260
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:22,800
when I was in London I attended reality

261
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:25,710
Church London for my year there yeah I

262
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,540
go to church today I sometimes skip some

263
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:29,640
weeks when I'm traveling and it's kind

264
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:31,260
of hard to make it to service and now

265
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:34,500
that we're in this social distancing

266
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:37,110
phase I'm watching sermons via the web

267
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,880
so doing that on Sunday mornings as my

268
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:41,220
church you are a big Harry Potter fan

269
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,589
back in the day yes I was a big Harry

270
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,720
Potter fan back in the day and I am also

271
00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:49,290
a big Harry Potter fan now when I first

272
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:52,110
read Harry Potter books 1 2 & 3 had

273
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:53,970
already come out so I actually read the

274
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:56,160
third book first and then I read the

275
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:58,290
first book and then I read the second

276
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:01,230
book and like the third book again and

277
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:04,200
then from like 4 through 7 that's when I

278
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:06,150
distinctly remember like getting the

279
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,770
book after the date

280
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:09,780
it was released or the day after it was

281
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:12,300
released staying up all night to read it

282
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:15,330
and then also going to watch the movies

283
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:17,070
of course and I didn't go to midnight

284
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:19,590
screenings for all of them but I

285
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:21,930
definitely did for the very last movie

286
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:23,850
so Deathly Hallows part-2 that was when

287
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:26,460
it was my senior year of college I think

288
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:29,550
and I went to a thrift store he had got

289
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:31,680
some ties for myself and for my friends

290
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:33,900
so he dressed up as Hogwarts students

291
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,240
for the last premiere you seem to be

292
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:38,220
very good at saving money yes so from

293
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,460
the first job that I had in high school

294
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:43,470
I learned to just save a portion of my

295
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:45,510
paycheck as soon as I got it before I

296
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:48,210
spent it on anything else so I still

297
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:50,490
have that habit to this day and I have a

298
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:52,590
video on how I saved fifty thousand

299
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,940
dollars to go to grad school in London

300
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:55,710
so I will link that in the description

301
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:58,380
box if you want to see that you have a

302
00:11:55,710 --> 00:12:00,300
jet-set style of life but you find time

303
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:03,030
for friends I think this can be true

304
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:05,040
because when I have like a business trip

305
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:07,440
in a certain city and I know that I have

306
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,900
friends who live there then I will try

307
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,670
to meet up with them so if I have a

308
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:14,310
meeting in Philly then I'll meet up with

309
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:18,030
my friend who is in school there I do

310
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:21,090
try to fit friends in with business

311
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:22,950
trips specifically if I can usually most

312
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:25,440
of the time I don't have time for that

313
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:27,360
or there isn't anybody there in that

314
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,920
city that I would see so it doesn't

315
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,500
always apply it on the whole I think I'm

316
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:33,450
kind of bad at regularly keeping up with

317
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:37,170
people I just tend to be pretty

318
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:39,480
independent and I don't mind if a friend

319
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:41,280
and I haven't spoken for a long time

320
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,740
but then we meet up and we're able to

321
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:47,130
catch up so I'm totally fine with that

322
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:49,800
but I know some people like more regular

323
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:52,770
contact and check-ins I lean more

324
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:55,440
towards the you know catching up with

325
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:58,200
like more time in-between but with my

326
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,330
close friends yes I you know keep up

327
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,010
with them a lot more frequently but it's

328
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:04,050
just a very small circle you don't get

329
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:06,390
homesick very often I think that's

330
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:09,660
pretty true I get homesick from time to

331
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:11,940
time but not very often at all when I

332
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:14,070
was in London there were times I think

333
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:16,320
right at the beginning that I was a bit

334
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:18,300
homesick because I missed Korean food

335
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,860
and Mexican food but again I'm a pretty

336
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,769
like independent

337
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:25,050
type of person so even though I love my

338
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:27,240
family and love when I do go home

339
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:30,690
to see them I don't get too homesick

340
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:32,940
often and now because I do so much

341
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:35,760
travel you know with my job obviously

342
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:39,089
not right at this moment but in general

343
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,290
I get to visit home a lot so so that

344
00:13:39,089 --> 00:13:43,230
helps so yeah this is another

345
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:45,480
interesting one you have anger issues or

346
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:47,490
at least used to I don't know about

347
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:51,269
anger issues but I definitely get

348
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:53,459
irritated pretty easily and I get really

349
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:56,670
upset with like inconsiderate people

350
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:58,890
with like people are like slowing other

351
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:02,390
people down like when people are being

352
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:05,820
indecisive or not like not trying to

353
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:07,170
provide a solution themselves but just

354
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:09,300
are pointing out like things that are

355
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:11,010
negative like I just I don't really like

356
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,720
when people are being too negative at

357
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:15,209
the same time I can be really negative

358
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,250
when I'm in a bad mood so I'm being a

359
00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:21,300
hypocrite for sure so I wouldn't say

360
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:24,209
anger issues maybe being irritated and I

361
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:26,880
do think it's gotten better over time so

362
00:14:24,209 --> 00:14:29,399
the at least used to portion of the

363
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:32,130
Assumption makes sense and the last one

364
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:35,040
here is you're a genuine person and

365
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:37,500
thank you first of all I thought it's

366
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,050
very kind and a really nice compliment I

367
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:42,540
do try my best to be as authentic and

368
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:43,770
genuine as possible sometimes I'm a

369
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,870
little too blunt

370
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:49,620
maybe so it can it can go to a negative

371
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:51,570
side sometimes this brings this one time

372
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:54,810
to mind when I was studying abroad

373
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:56,880
during college and I had my kind of

374
00:14:54,810 --> 00:15:00,390
group of study abroad friends and we

375
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:02,250
were talking about what we kind of

376
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:04,320
assumed about each other when we first

377
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:07,110
met each other so like what were our

378
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,940
first impressions and then like what we

379
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:10,589
thought about each other now basically

380
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:12,360
like what was different about our first

381
00:15:10,589 --> 00:15:13,589
impressions of each other and you know

382
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,589
now that we had gotten to know each

383
00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:18,570
other you know what had changed and one

384
00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:20,820
of my friends had told me that nothing

385
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:23,190
really had changed for me that I was

386
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:25,260
just kind of the same as when they first

387
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:27,959
met me so I hope that that's how I am

388
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:30,720
for the most part and I try to be that

389
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:31,710
way and I think most people do try to be

390
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,380
genuine and

391
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:36,360
Suntech so I don't think I'm anything

392
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:39,030
special for trying to do that my foot

393
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:41,250
has completely fallen asleep now I can

394
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:43,890
like not even feel the floor like I can

395
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:46,410
barely feel the floor when I'm touching

396
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:48,780
it with my foot so I think that it is

397
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:50,100
time now for me to end this video I hope

398
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:52,440
this helped you get to know me a little

399
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:54,000
bit better as always leave comments for
