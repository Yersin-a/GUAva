1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,740
ever since I was a kid my favorite

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,720
holiday has always been Christmas having

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,370
grown up in the East Coast I associate

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,380
winter and the holidays with my

5
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,300
childhood I'd always look forward to the

6
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,460
snow and the jingles and the lights

7
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,289
every single year and then I moved to

8
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:19,109
Southern California and discovered that

9
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:21,240
Christmas kind of sexier all the

10
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:23,730
snow-capped pine trees are replaced with

11
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,740
palm trees charred by fires from the

12
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,019
previous summer and I don't know if

13
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,390
you've noticed but we're on fire a lot

14
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:32,309
there weren't nearly as many Christmas

15
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,010
lights illuminating the neighborhoods

16
00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:37,230
and the Christmas jingles just didn't

17
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,629
hit the same anymore now I know these

18
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,520
are all trivial firstworldproblems but

19
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:43,440
I've been living here for almost a whole

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,629
decade and I can't remember a single

21
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,000
California Christmas I've had I remember

22
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:50,879
the summers because the summers were

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,129
always a blast but every December I'd

24
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,320
miss the cozy and fester feeling of

25
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:57,300
Christmas and winter back in college

26
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,000
when I used to work part-time as a sushi

27
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,649
cashier every December the plaza I

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,449
worked at would do this thing where they

29
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:05,519
place these snow machines in the trees

30
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:07,619
and at 6:00 p.m. every night they'd

31
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,240
release a flurry of fake snow to make it

32
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:11,460
look like it was snowing for like ten

33
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,799
minutes this was mostly for the children

34
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,689
to enjoy but I remember being excited

35
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,580
for it every time if it was a

36
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:20,310
particularly slow night I'd occasionally

37
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,259
step outside to watch and I felt like I

38
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,810
was back to being 12 years old again

39
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,820
it's like my holiday spirit and cheer

40
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,979
has been stuck in this a nostalgic time

41
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,600
capsule you know that scene in The Lion

42
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:32,579
the Witch and the Wardrobe when Lucy

43
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,770
discovers Narnia and everything is just

44
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:36,810
covered in snow with cute little street

45
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,549
lamps and she's like got this like a

46
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,400
Wonder in her eyes as she's walking

47
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:43,380
around that was me every winter as a kid

48
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,600
and I just want to be able to experience

49
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,850
that again at some point back in

50
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,829
elementary middle and even high school

51
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:51,869
there was something really magical about

52
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:54,060
waking up and just seeing nothing but

53
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:55,680
white outside my window and getting that

54
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,420
automated voice message on the house

55
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,810
phone about how school was closed for

56
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,759
the day

57
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,799
my best friend up the street would call

58
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,719
me up from her house phone and ask if I

59
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,939
wanted to go sledding we would end up

60
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:08,399
bruised and sore from crashing into ice

61
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:09,929
and snow for hours but we wouldn't even

62
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,730
notice because we were numb from the

63
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:13,650
cold and from all the fun we were having

64
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,299
and then finally when we'd

65
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,700
back to her house with our gloves off

66
00:02:15,299 --> 00:02:19,260
and our hand steaming we'd be greeted

67
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,840
with the smell of hot chocolate and

68
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:23,519
cinnamon then maybe we'd see it start to

69
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,470
flurry and hope that school would be

70
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:27,390
closed again the next morning in the

71
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:29,280
mornings where I did end up having to go

72
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,780
to school I'd wake up and spend a good

73
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,730
20 minutes sitting in front of this

74
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:35,129
box-shaped electric heater that we had

75
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:37,560
just soaking in that warm toasty

76
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:39,060
goodness and if my shoes and socks got

77
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,560
all wet from the snow on the way home

78
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,120
from school I'd head straight to the

79
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,970
bathroom to fill the tub up with hot

80
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,889
water and dip my icy cold feet in and it

81
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:49,500
feel like a mini spa for a couple

82
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:51,900
minutes I feel like the cold just made

83
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,629
everything smell and taste better to

84
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,549
that feeling of your body slowly warming

85
00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:58,709
up as you eat warm soup and buttered

86
00:02:56,549 --> 00:03:00,629
biscuits and then falling asleep and a

87
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:02,700
warm pile of fuzzy blankets right

88
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:04,560
afterwards to the sound of classic

89
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,180
Christmas songs in an eight-hour loop of

90
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,430
crackling fire that someone put on the

91
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,260
TV and who could forget the presence of

92
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:12,599
course presents are one of the few

93
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:14,639
Christmas activities I still do and I

94
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:17,790
really enjoy wrapping presents although

95
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:19,500
I'm not very good at it but as a kid I

96
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:21,329
really liked watching my mom wrap

97
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,519
presents because she did everything so

98
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:24,870
quickly neatly and she'd do that thing

99
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,120
where she'd cut through wrapping paper

100
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:30,389
like it was butter which I've still yet

101
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,489
to figure out how to master okay so

102
00:03:30,389 --> 00:03:35,220
these are the presents that Christine

103
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:37,829
wrapped and put together we've got cute

104
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:40,440
little decorations on them they're

105
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:42,269
elegant they're gorgeous they're neatly

106
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:45,840
put together they look like something

107
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:48,030
off of Pinterest honestly and then on

108
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:52,290
the other side you have the presents I

109
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:54,629
wrapped which are kind of sloppy but you

110
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:56,879
know an attempt was made especially on

111
00:03:54,629 --> 00:04:00,060
this one where the bottom looks like

112
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:03,540
this and I know it looks like I didn't

113
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:06,000
try but this was actually my fourth

114
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:09,060
attempt at trying to wrap this object so

115
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,840
you can only imagine how awful the first

116
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:15,750
three attempts must reflect and and then

117
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,659
you have the present Sun Moon raft um

118
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:21,690
they're very straightforward just like

119
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:23,219
he is I'm still not that great at

120
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:25,020
wrapping presents so usually for

121
00:04:23,219 --> 00:04:26,610
birthdays or something I'll just throw

122
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,300
it in a gift bag with some tissue paper

123
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,340
on top and

124
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,050
call it a day but Christmas time is when

125
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:33,090
you bring out all the effort in wrapping

126
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:35,190
gift boxes that's when you bust out the

127
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:37,169
glittery at a holographic wrapping paper

128
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:38,729
and ribbons and the cute name labels

129
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:40,199
doesn't matter if it's like sixty

130
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:41,639
degrees outside and there's no tree to

131
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:44,190
put the presents under whatever holiday

132
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:46,110
spirit I can muster up is put into gift

133
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:48,389
shopping and gift wrapping but the

134
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:50,159
winter memory I look back on most fondly

135
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:52,759
would have to be when it snowed during

136
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:55,500
the evening let me set the scene for you

137
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:57,509
after the Sun went down the whole sky

138
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,129
was that cloudy dark blue color that

139
00:04:57,509 --> 00:05:01,500
made everything looked like it had a

140
00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:03,509
blue filter over it nobody was outside

141
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,909
at this time and there were also no

142
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:07,860
passing cars just the snow being faintly

143
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:10,409
illuminated by the Christmas lights on

144
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,539
people's houses I wanted the sweet

145
00:05:10,409 --> 00:05:14,940
satisfaction of taking the first steps

146
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:16,800
in the fresh snow so I got all bundled

147
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,990
up and walked out into my front yard

148
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,960
there wasn't any wind and there were no

149
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:24,300
birds or animals or even people it was

150
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,979
so still and quiet that the only thing I

151
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,870
could hear was the sound of my own

152
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:30,240
breathing and the sound of the snow

153
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:31,680
crunching under my feet I thought it'd

154
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,990
be interesting to lay down in the snow

155
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,120
on my back and stare up at the sky until

156
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:38,550
it quickly changed from dark blue to

157
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,990
pitch-black I couldn't see the clouds so

158
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:42,750
it looked as though the snow is just

159
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:44,699
spawning out of nowhere for a moment it

160
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:47,219
felt like time had stopped and the only

161
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:49,259
thing in motion were the snowflakes the

162
00:05:47,219 --> 00:05:51,569
cushiony feeling of the snow felt so

163
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:53,849
comfortable and relaxing and with my

164
00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:55,529
coat keeping me warm I felt like I could

165
00:05:53,849 --> 00:05:58,050
just fall asleep right then and there

166
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:59,490
you know up until what a my parents

167
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:01,020
inevitably busted out of the house

168
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:03,090
worried that I'd fainted in the snow or

169
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:05,460
something I'm not saying you can't enjoy

170
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:06,870
hot cocoa or Christmas music or wrapping

171
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,210
presents in California

172
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:11,370
I still do those things of course but

173
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:14,909
ever since I moved here Christmas has

174
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:17,279
just always felt kinda off like

175
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:19,469
something was missing maybe it's the

176
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:20,729
lack of pine trees the lack of snow the

177
00:06:19,469 --> 00:06:22,259
fact that there isn't really a need for

178
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:24,240
scarves or coats because the weather's

179
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:26,159
always like 60 degrees here or it just

180
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,900
feels like any other day in the year

181
00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:29,849
because the seasons don't change very

182
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:32,490
much so you don't even notice Christmas

183
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:34,319
creeping up on you and then I wonder do

184
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:35,849
I only have a fondness for it because I

185
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,789
never had to deal with the winter as an

186
00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:40,770
adult I moved to California at age 15

187
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:43,199
before I had to deal with the strug

188
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:45,180
of driving on icy roads or having to

189
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,310
wake up early and go to work in freezing

190
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:49,860
weather or having to scrape ice off of

191
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:52,139
my car maybe because I've only ever

192
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:54,360
really experienced a winter as a child

193
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:56,729
that's why I've never really lost that

194
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,440
childlike wonder for it and maybe I

195
00:06:56,729 --> 00:07:00,900
wouldn't feel the same if I'd never

196
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,030
moved away from it as they say the grass

197
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,710
is always greener on the other side and

198
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:07,289
I'm sure a lot of people would argue

199
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:08,819
that having sunny non humid weather for

200
00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:10,289
the majority of the year is way better

201
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:12,449
than dealing with the annoyances that

202
00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:14,009
come with each passing season but

203
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:16,080
whether you're spending the holidays in

204
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:17,610
a winter wonderland or not at the end of

205
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,169
the day what matters the most is that

206
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,550
you're spending it with people you love

207
00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:23,069
or at the very least

208
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:24,840
enjoying yourself however you like not

209
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:27,090
to sound like a cheesy hallmark movie or

210
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,430
anything I hope you all have a wonderful

211
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:33,270
holiday season and if not then a

212
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:54,609
wonderful start to 2020 see you then

213
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:54,609
