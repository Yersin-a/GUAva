a bread bowl

109
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,560
the questions have come in quite a bit

110
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,039

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,479
all of you for submitting your questions

112
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:41,839

113
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:41,839
delicious soup

114
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,959
that right there that's that's

115
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,800
it that's it man i know in american

116
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,399
culture you're not supposed to make any

117
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,760
noise while eating your soup

118
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:58,480
but in asian culture slurping is good

119
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,320
and these asian spoons are made for

120
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,360
slurping first question is from

121
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,680
will jlp do you prefer dating

122
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,920
younger older or same age men if we're

123
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,800
up to me i would choose older but i'm

124
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,040
not

125
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,480
closed off to people my age i've always

126
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,440
hung out with people that have been

127
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,040
older than i am

128
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,720
so i feel like i just get along better

129
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,399
with older guys but again these are all

130
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,040
generalizations it really just depends

131
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,040
on the guy

132
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,320
how was your high school experience i

133
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,440
was actually

134
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,959
new to my high school and um i didn't

135
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,519
have a lot of friends in that school

136
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,959
district

137
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,519
i kind of hated high school and i was

138
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:34,800
really quiet and a bit anti-social

139
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:37,360
by choice i didn't even go to my prom

140
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,480
because i was like f this school i hate

141
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,680

few

144
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,839
and it depends on my mood but currently

145
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,040
i have

146
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,880
a playlist called cheese and wine that i

147
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,000
curated and it's all

148
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:56,080
jazz it makes me feel very sort of

149
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,120
sophisticated and elegant and

150
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,560
feminine and this is kind of a playlist

151
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,360
i like to gravitate towards when i'm

152
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,079

153
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,839

describe

166
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,519

167
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,079
just be chill and oh my god look at that

168
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,959
sunset in the back

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,079
wow sorry i get distracted really easily

170
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,240
top three foods

171
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,279
you can't live without i can't live

172
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,200
without

173
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:47,279
halal kimchi and pho

174
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,519
do you have any random hobbies slash

175
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,519
things you like to do in your free time

176
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,079
boxing was a big one i was really really

177
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,519
getting into boxing before cloved but

178
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,200
all the gyms ended up closing down

179
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,560
obviously what in your opinion are your

180
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,760
best qualities

181
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:05,040
this could be a good and a bad thing but

182
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,279
i consider myself very dense not

183
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,560
the prettiest term to use to describe

184
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,320
myself but

185
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,240
what i mean by that is that i have a

186
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,760
pretty strong foundation

187
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,320
and i stay true to my gut and what i

188
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,120
know

189
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,560
i feel like i'm very grounded in my

190
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,880
values and beliefs

191
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,120
so it kind of makes me a very stable

192
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:28,079
person but it could be a bad thing

193
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,839
in the sense that i can be stubborn or a

194
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,160
little close-minded at times

195
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,839
but i try to remind myself to be as

196
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,440
open-minded as possible if i'm like

197
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,240
catching myself being close-minded i

198
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,600
tried to

199
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,680

200
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,040

203
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,839
myself

in every facet going to the gym more and

205
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,360
taking care of myself which

206
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,279
to be honest i haven't really been doing

207
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,000
a good job of recently it's not really

208
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,560
about like getting my

209
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,880
nails done and doing a face mask it's

210
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:04,000
really just deep diving into

211
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:06,480
who i am and working on

212
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000

218
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,480
astrology

219
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,000
let me know what that combination means

220
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,680
down in the comments because

221
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,279
i i love all things astrology related

222
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,839
how many tattoos do you have i only have

223
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:34,240
one on my arm it's a little hard to see

224
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,680
from the front if i turn around you

225
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,160
could see more of it

226
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,839
this is my first and only tattoo what

227
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,639
were three difficult things in your

228
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,920
childhood well

229
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,320
this one's kind of deep being a second

230
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,240
gen

231
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,079
korean-american if your parents don't

232
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,399
speak english then a lot of things

233
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,399
kind of fall on you and you have to sort

234
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,920
of help them figure out documents

235
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,440
and obviously you don't even understand

236
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,200
those documents because you're a kid

237
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,120
but you just have to kind of figure it

238
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,040
out another thing was that i was not

239
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,560
financially comfortable growing up

240
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,040
uh grew up in a very poor family so that

241
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,600
was

242
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,800
definitely difficult and three

243
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,200
difficulty

244
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,560
was i guess that my parents both my

245
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,959
parents were always working

246
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,720
is it the idea of fame that's attractive

247
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,360
to you or the potential to be your own

248
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,079
boss

249
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,440
without a doubt it's the second answer i

250
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,360
don't really care about clout

251
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,600
not a question but you seem like a big

252
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,079
