00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:17,920

my experience as an asian american

what's going on you guys welcome back to

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,920
my channel i

8
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,760
woke up feeling so amazing i'm like

9
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,039
totally recalibrated

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,039
reset after the holiday break i'm

11
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:50,160
excited to actually

12
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:54,320
get into the groove of things and

13
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:57,600
fall back into a normal routine i

14
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,399
just have been in this major

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,160
slump for the past couple months and

16
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,199
stopped working out completely

17
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,600
and let myself go i gained

18
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,560
seven to eight pounds i'm not really

19
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,520
feeling myself

20
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,479
and it's definitely contributed to a lot

21
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,680
of

22
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,040
mental negativity that i've been

23
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,520
carrying with me over the last couple of

24
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,200
months

25
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,799
lately whenever i just look in the

26
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,840
mirror i'm like

27
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:26,400
yuck i hate what i see so

28
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,000
enough sulking about it i need to do

29
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,159
something about it and pull myself

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,560
together because no one will do that for

31
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,240
me

32
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,600
i already feel like i'm so much more

33
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,400
energized because

34
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,040
i i've worked out for like the past four

35
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,720
days

36
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,799
so i'm gonna start eating healthier too

37
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,960
i actually saw a really cool recipe

38
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,159
online and they were

39
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,360
by marion's kitchen she just posted a

40
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,079
bond me

41
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,799
lettuce wrap recipe that i really want

42
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,000
to try

43
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,520
it fits within my diet so i'm

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:08,500
about to head to the grocery store to

45
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:17,259
pick up some of the things that i need

58
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,840
i recently joined this new app called

59
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,880
clubhouse it is

60
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,280
unfortunately invite only but it's a

61
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,080
really

62
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,639
interesting space it's kind of like a

63
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,240
group

64
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:43,360
podcast or i also like to say it's

65
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:46,400
an audio reddit

66
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,240
like you can join these chat rooms that

67
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,919
discuss a range of different topics

68
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,600
sometimes it could get very career

69
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,280
focused sometimes it's just about

70
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,600
anything and everything

71
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,199
but i've been listening in on a lot of

72
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,520
chat rooms

73
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,960
talking about korean american identity

74
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,919
this has actually

75
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,919
been surprisingly one of my most

76
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:09,680
requested topics to

77
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,639
discuss in my videos but i've kind of

78
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,080
just

79
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,000
i don't know i never gave it the light

80
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,199
because i was like i don't know what's

81
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,360
so

82
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,479
interesting about my story but these

83
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,680
chat rooms in

84
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:24,560
clubhouse really kind of shed some light

85
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,120
onto why it is important to share my

86
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:30,080
experience as an asian american with

87
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,639
the platform that i have all right i'm

88
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,680
actually

89
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:37,120
gonna sit down for this one i

90
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,080
was born in flushing queens raised in

91
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,400
long island

92
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,160
i went to school k through 12 in long

93
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,080
island and then as soon as i graduated

94
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,880
high school i moved back to queens

95
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,440
throughout my entire life i juggled both

96
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,759
the

97
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:55,199
urban and suburban environments so i was

98
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:57,360
influenced by both and i understand

99
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,360
both my mom worked at a nail salon my

100
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,960
dad was in wholesale

101
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,680
i grew up in the basement of someone

102
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,759
else's

103
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,600
home in long island so whenever people

104
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,520
hear that i grew up in long island they

105
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,160
automatically assumed that i grew up

106
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,960
rich

107
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,120
or that my family is rich but that's

108
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:20,240
completely not the case at all

109
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,840
my parents intentionally lived under

110
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,360
shitty circumstances

111
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,039
just to put me in better public

112
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,960
schooling and long island if you don't

113
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:30,880
know is demographically

114
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:33,840
very white in my school i was

115
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,360
i think one of three asian girls total

116
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,000
in the entire class

117
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,199
when i was younger i was like i am going

118
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,240
to assimilate as

119
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:45,280
much as i could like i was going to

120
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,840
be white okay but that

121
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,960
meant conforming to all of the whiteness

122
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,960
i saw around me

123
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,199
and because i assimilated so well i was

124
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,319
actually pretty popular in school

125
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,560
i was popular in school yet so

126
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,000
incredibly embarrassed of my background

127
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,039
i was embarrassed

128
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,759
to be asian and poor in a

129
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:07,039
rich white neighborhood people obviously

130
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,000
found out i was

131
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:12,000
asian couldn't hide that but i tried to

132
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,080
conceal it as much as i

133
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,680
could and that came in the form of

134
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,039
things like the meals

135
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:21,120
i brought to lunch if my meals ever

136
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,400
required an explanation to my white

137
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,120
friends

138
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,520
then it was a no like i cannot bring

139
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,639
that to school that is social suicide

140
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,440
my mom knew never to pack me korean food

141
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,120
for lunch

142
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,720
she knew damn well not to pack korean

143
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,280
food for lunch i let her know

144
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,840
but the only asian food that was okay to

145
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,319
bring to

146
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,919
school was leftover chinese food because

147
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,240
all the white girls did that too

148
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,759
but being poor was something i was a

149
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,599
little bit better at hiding and that's

150
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:51,360
something i tried to do

151
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:53,919
um more of so whenever i had

152
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,960
play dates or friends decide to hang out

153
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,879
at someone's house

154
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,319
it was never my house it always had to

155
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,560
be someone else's house because

156
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,560
i lived in a shitty basement that's

157
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,759
embarrassing so i couldn't have

158
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:09,599
my friends see that and see how

159
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:12,240
i was living compared to their suburban

160
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,000
million dollar homes with pools and the

161
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,759
moment that i dreaded every

162
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:21,440
day was getting dropped off at school

163
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:24,240
in my crusty old

164
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,199
white dodge caravan i was so embarrassed

165
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,560
of that thing

166
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,720
because everybody was pulling up in

167
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,080
their like typical suburban

168
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,440
suvs the highlanders and even escalades

169
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,680
for the richer people

170
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,039
and i was the only one with the outdated

171
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,120
dodge caravan

172
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,399
as soon as i got out of the car i would

173
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,519
just look down

174
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,560
and scurry into the school building as

175
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,200
fast as i could

176
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,760
just to minimize the chance of anybody

177
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,760
ever

178
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,800
seeing me come out of that car i also

179
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,880
dragged my mom

180
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,839
to all like the fancy department stores

181
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,959
and the shops

182
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,640
that all my friends would go to to get

183
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,680
their clothes because i had to look like

184
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,480
them i had to be

185
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,760
then um but this drove my mom nuts

186
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,640
because she couldn't

187
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,800
afford a lot of these items like she

188
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,920
couldn't afford 150 dollar

189
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:17,120
uggs for her 10 year old child or

190
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:19,200
the 70 pair of yoga pants that

191
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,320
everybody else was wearing but i was

192
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,200
really adamant about

193
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,279
that and i was like if i'm going to be

194
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,480
accepted into this very white

195
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,839
crowd then i have to look the part i was

196
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,680
too young to understand

197
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,600
you know the financial circumstances

198
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,720
that we were in and what that meant

199
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,959
but in eighth grade my world changed i

200
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,880
moved to a new school that was still

201
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,760
pretty white but it was a much bigger

202
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,680
school

203
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,279
and there were a lot more asians the

204
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,120
white people here were different

205
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,720
and they weren't the people that i grew

206
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,640
up with

207
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,800
so i kind of just shut down and i was

208
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,920
like i'm not gonna fit in anywhere here

209
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,800
i kind of was a lone wolf throughout

210
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,200
high school

211
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,440
so this is the part where i started

212
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,880
hanging out in queens a lot

213
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:07,360
i was drawn to how everybody in queens

214
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,640
struggled the way that i did everybody

215
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,200
in queens

216
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,480
had that immigrant struggle that i could

217
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,279
relate to

218
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,920
that's where i felt like i belonged the

219
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,120
most

220
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,000
i felt normal just being in queens as i

221
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,040
got older

222
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,480
and the more comfortable i became with

223
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:29,040
my korean-american identity i

224
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,360
started meeting a lot of people a lot

225
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,480
more asian-americans and

226
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:37,360
i realized just how amazing

227
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:40,240
some people were and the things that you

228
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,880
know my peers and my mentors were doing

229
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,920
i was like damn you're asian american

230
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,160
like me

231
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,000
living in this very white world i don't

232
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,160
know i was just so inspired by

233
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,760
the cool people that i met i met a lot

234
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,079
of people in

235
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,120
the arts i met a lot of people in

236
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,240
entertainment

237
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,160
we have a lot to push through and we

238
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,279
have a lot to prove

239
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,240
in our society but i think it's just so

240
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:08,079
important

241
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,680
as asian americans to uplift each other

242
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,120
rather than compete with each other

243
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,040
because we're all just trying to

244
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,480
leave our mark in this world and i'm

245
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,920
just going to leave off by saying that

246
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,279
we all

247
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:22,399
just need to help each other grow

248
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,839
as an asian-american community and

249
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,760
cheer for one another because we're all

250
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,160
doing such great things and this

251
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,890
is exactly what our immigrant parents

252
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:37,669
came to america
