1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,410
saying you don't see race is the most

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,020
racist thing you can say paint color

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:09,240
wine is being blind to the thousands of

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:19,619
years of oppression so I'm sorry sister

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:23,670
but I totally see race with Amy I'm your

6
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:25,820
lovely host you guessed it Amy and today

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,990
we are going to talk about growing up

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:31,140
asian-american and right now I'm just

9
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,910
finishing up my concealer because I

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,170
already did my base and my brows so I

11
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,239
can speed up the process a little bit

12
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,000
but I wanted to make this a tag video

13
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,980
just for fun because I know a lot of my

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,930
Asian American content creator friends

15
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,879
have expressed concern to me that they

16
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:48,120
wanted to talk about this but just

17
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:50,100
didn't really know how to and secondly

18
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,500
if you guys want to do it I would love

19
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,000
for you to answer these questions you

20
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,890
don't have to do your makeup that's just

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,079
my thing with the am with Amy I'm

22
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,730
sitting down here drinking tea doing my

23
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,120
makeup talking about some heavy ship

24
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:05,010
sometimes but you don't have to do your

25
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,590
makeup so I mean you can but it is a

26
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:10,260
little bit hot I will say that also if I

27
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:13,320
sound a little sick it is because I am

28
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:16,470
on day 8 of recovering from I think the

29
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:20,720
flu so my nose is crazy I have my tea as

30
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,720
I said so just bear with me

31
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,940
korean-american

32
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:32,590
born in Korea and I was born here in the

33
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:32,590
states in California

34
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,229
I'm from a city in the Los Angeles

35
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:43,390
County the Greater Los Angeles County

36
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:45,520
it's not LA itself but it's in the

37
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:47,710
county and it's kind of on the border of

38
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,750
LA and Orange County and it's called

39
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:53,200
Cerritos and for those of you who are

40
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:55,360
familiar with Cerritos it is very much

41
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,610
so like Irvine it is predominantly Asian

42
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,430
lots of good Asian food lots of boba

43
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:04,210
spots but it's just a lot of Asian

44
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:07,150
families and it's just a very aged in

45
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:09,690
place but the city is neighboring it

46
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:12,700
like Artesia Bellflower Norwalk are

47
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:15,910
predominantly Latin or Hispanic

48
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:18,850
communities and so I think growing up I

49
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:22,450
never truly felt like a minority but the

50
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:24,850
first time that I understood that I was

51
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:29,440
different or I understand it there is a

52
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:32,110
demarcation between you know me and the

53
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,000
Latin kids or whatever was I remember in

54
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:36,220
second grade I was probably eight years

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,820
old and we were sitting on the classroom

56
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:43,420
floor and there was a guy named Bobby

57
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:45,010
who was Mexican I believe and he asked

58
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:48,489
me straight up to my face

59
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:51,220
he said Amy why are your eyes so [ __ ]

60
00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:53,350
and I was just like whatever you know

61
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,120
he's just being mean and it kind of

62
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:58,570
brushed it off but then then he proceeds

63
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,549
to say that there's so kinky that I look

64
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:03,190
horny and I was eight years old and I

65
00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:06,070
remember distinctly thinking like what

66
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:08,230
is funny mean like my I look like I have

67
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:10,959
horns on my face or like I look like a

68
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:13,329
unicorn I was just so confused and I

69
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,760
said what the heck is horny I was just

70
00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:19,060
like what do you mean and he was just

71
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,160
like never mind he was like just she

72
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,769
just just kind of laughed about that but

73
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,090
I remember he would say that to me a lot

74
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:27,130
he would always bully me from my eyes

75
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:29,380
and growing up I did experience quite a

76
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:32,140
lot of bullying from a lot of the Latin

77
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:34,239
kids for my eyes but even for me that

78
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:36,610
was my biggest aha moment that I was

79
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,250
like oh wow my eyes do look different

80
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:41,950
from them and I'm different from them

81
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:44,230
and that is when that kind of all

82
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:46,880
started as a concept I also really

83
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:49,490
wanted to learn what horny was but I had

84
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:52,190
- like way later I feel like was crazy

85
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:54,530
to me is that happen so long ago when we

86
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,220
were in second grade and I remember

87
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:57,530
exactly

88
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:59,210
his full name which I will not say and

89
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:02,300
what do you look like and where we were

90
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:04,460
and exactly how I felt and it just it's

91
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,990
like crystal clear in my memory even

92
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:09,340
though everything else from second grade

93
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:09,340
is really not that clear

94
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:17,320
so elementary school was pretty okay and

95
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:19,780
I feel like I got bullied mainly for how

96
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:22,510
[ __ ] my eyes were and I can't really

97
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:23,830
remember what race they were so I really

98
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:25,660
can't tell if they were Asian people

99
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,430
also making vitami because Asian Club

100
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:30,760
also made fun of me for my [ __ ] eyes

101
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:33,010
which is so bizarre but anyways so

102
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:36,220
middle school is definitely what I felt

103
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:38,830
there were a lot more Hispanic people or

104
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:41,080
Latin people and I would be believed for

105
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:43,240
being Asian or for being too smart or

106
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,440
why I always got A's on tests or

107
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,560
whatever I kind of falling into that

108
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:50,080
model minority myth but high school is

109
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,390
when I finally went to Cerritos high

110
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,130
school which is a school that was not on

111
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:57,940
anywhere of the border of these

112
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:59,920
neighboring cities and it was all Asian

113
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:02,200
kids I remember going to the first day

114
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:04,150
of school and I was like well there's so

115
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,530
many people here that look like me and

116
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,600
I've come to school and it'd just be

117
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:09,970
like a group of Asian kids like smoking

118
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,940
and listening to like fly like a g6 and

119
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:15,010
it was just very I just felt like I was

120
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:17,740
like in a Far East Movement music video

121
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:20,170
I just so many Asian kids so who thought

122
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:22,180
they were cool or nerdy ones whereas in

123
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:25,210
middle school you know Asian kids were

124
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:26,860
just like nerdy and one-dimensional in

125
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,900
that sense because we were surrounded

126
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:32,230
with other minorities but in high

127
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:34,270
schools all Asian people and we had you

128
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:37,660
know ancient nerds the cool Asians like

129
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:40,120
in Mean Girls and the Asian jocks

130
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:42,100
retired football team was Asian we had

131
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,980
literally had no diversity in this

132
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:47,410
school and so I think that was when I

133
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:49,330
realized like oh my gosh I'm surrounded

134
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:51,880
by so many people like me and Who I am

135
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:56,650
as a person I think I've always been a

136
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:58,600
very anti-establishment and meri I like

137
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:00,520
to stray from the norm and I'm very I

138
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,200
don't like conformity I don't like if

139
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,870
everyone says to do this I'm always like

140
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,970
why why why and so soon as I got into

141
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:09,010
high school I noticed that a lot of like

142
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:11,650
the cool Asians with popular kids were

143
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:13,630
really into like R&B and hip-hop and

144
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:17,290
they were amazing at dancing and

145
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:19,030
choreography and our drill team or dance

146
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:21,190
turtle team looks like so good they're

147
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:25,380
always competing and I was just like

148
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:29,130
okay that's what's cool but to me I

149
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:31,260
want to be that way and so I think in my

150
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:33,210
high school it is very normal uncool to

151
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:35,070
be Asian because literally everyone is

152
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:37,500
Asian and that is the norm and so I

153
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:41,220
think I started to really reject my

154
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:44,340
culture when I was in 15 when I was 15

155
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:48,300
to like 17 years old because I was just

156
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:50,430
not I just didn't want to fit in with

157
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,470
that crowd and so if everyone will

158
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:54,360
listen to R&B and hip-hop I wanted to go

159
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:57,060
listen to rock and like heavy metal and

160
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,550
that's when I discovered I made it and

161
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:01,980
Slayer Metallica and stuff like that and

162
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:04,860
if everyone was wearing like this

163
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:05,820
certain type of shoe like I would want

164
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:08,100
to wear something completely different

165
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,990
from that and so in high school I really

166
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:12,510
started to reject my Asian culture I

167
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:15,330
didn't even drink buh-buh-buh-buh it's

168
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:17,700
like the hugest thing in cerritos like

169
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:20,070
people go out to bubble spots at 2:00

170
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,960
a.m. and that's like it's it's a good

171
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:23,370
thing it's neck tivity and I remember

172
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,200
and all throughout high school I only

173
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:27,570
started liking boba until I met one of

174
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,590
my best friend's Sharon who caught me

175
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,870
addicted to boba

176
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:32,430
but even then I just I just I just

177
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:34,440
didn't want any part of it

178
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:36,810
and I think a lot of that was because I

179
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,790
just didn't want to be like everybody

180
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,200
else I just really didn't want to

181
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,820
identify with that and all my

182
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,830
personality tests if you guys believe in

183
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:45,510
like the myers-briggs like I'm an IAT

184
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:47,490
Jay and if you believe in the zodiac

185
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:49,040
with Aquarius and all of my personality

186
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:52,830
tests always talk about how

187
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:54,530
nonconformist I am I even won best dress

188
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:57,690
in high school my senior year and I

189
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:59,250
hated that I won it because I always

190
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,750
felt well one I thought none of the

191
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:03,090
electives were actually indicative of

192
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:04,440
how that person actually was so the best

193
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:06,060
dress was never really that best dress

194
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,850
and like most most likely to succeed

195
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:10,860
would never really be successful and - I

196
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:13,350
hated that I was a popularity contest it

197
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:15,150
was completely not backed on anything

198
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:17,250
other than whether or not people knew

199
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:19,110
you and liked you and stuff like that so

200
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,640
I actually stayed home from that day

201
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:22,560
when they announced and they crowned you

202
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:26,250
put you up on stage to give you a sash

203
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,900
[ __ ] sash so that was when I was 18

204
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:30,720
and I think that's when I became way

205
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:32,789
more in tune with myself and my politics

206
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,860
and where I stand because that is

207
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:37,790
definitely the last year that I strayed

208
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:39,410
away from wanting to not be age

209
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:42,530
if that makes sense I think that was

210
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:44,720
when I was rejecting what I thought was

211
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:46,130
too perceived as being Asian which was

212
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,690
like listening to Far East Movement but

213
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:49,100
it's hard to say that I wouldn't just

214
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:51,050
simulate if I went to a predominately

215
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,400
white school because I didn't go to a

216
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:54,380
predominantly white school and I who's

217
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,180
to say I would be here from the norm

218
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:58,280
then because maybe I wouldn't want to

219
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,810
fit in then I don't know so it's hard to

220
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,580
say it but I just do know that my

221
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:03,470
experience is very idiosyncratic to me

222
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:05,360
because a lot of people I talk to don't

223
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:08,360
have this experience is like literally

224
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,430
my graduation when they sign up all the

225
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,470
names it was like Pak Pak Pak Lee Lee

226
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:14,270
Lee Kim Kim Kim Jun dejected changing

227
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:16,510
changing changing changing for like

228
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:19,370
hours and I was probably the funniest

229
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:20,690
Lee that they said and when I tell that

230
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,410
people they're like what the heck that's

231
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:25,010
crazy

232
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:27,800
so but I just do know that I perceived

233
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:30,020
Asian being Asian American to be a

234
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,300
certain way in high school because I was

235
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:36,430
surrounded by that one type of image and

236
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:36,430
so I wanted to veer from that

237
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:41,690
one of them is the model minority myth

238
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:46,380
and that type of stereotype because

239
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:48,300
growing up for me it's we're all as

240
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:54,450
Asians were expected to be good at math

241
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:58,589
and to just be naturally naturally

242
00:09:54,450 --> 00:10:02,779
gifted in matters of school and academia

243
00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:07,130
and I am also the second child and so

244
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:10,200
growing up I was never ever you know

245
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:13,589
superbly brilliant as I'm sure a lot of

246
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:16,529
you are not as well but I think being

247
00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:18,950
compared to my older brother I was

248
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:22,410
always kind of seen as a lot less

249
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:24,000
intellectual or smart and so I feel like

250
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:26,550
I always grew up with this underdog

251
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,779
mentality which then propelled me to

252
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:33,029
stay after school ask for tutoring come

253
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:35,640
before school and really really study

254
00:10:33,029 --> 00:10:38,370
the extra hour is like I would go crazy

255
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:40,529
with no cards I literally had a color

256
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:42,870
chart for color coding with my

257
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:45,360
highlighters and that has always been

258
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:48,030
the driving force as to why I worked so

259
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,130
hard and it has nothing to do with me

260
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:52,200
being Asian and being this model

261
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:53,940
minority and being naturally gifted for

262
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,770
me personally is because I was always

263
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,450
told that I was not very smart growing

264
00:10:55,770 --> 00:11:00,480
up and always being compared to someone

265
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:04,110
and so that drove me and my insecurities

266
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:06,660
to not be that way and so the model

267
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:09,510
minority just tells us that as Asians we

268
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:12,720
are naturally good at math we are good

269
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:14,550
at sciences and you know it has nothing

270
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,839
to do with how hard we work and find

271
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:17,300
that the model minority is so

272
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,010
destructive for a lot of my

273
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:22,170
asian-american friends who no matter how

274
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:24,089
hard they study or no matter how hard

275
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:25,920
they work they just cannot get the

276
00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:27,990
results that their parents want or that

277
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,820
society deems that we should have it's

278
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:33,000
like they work their ass off and still

279
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:34,560
cannot get even you know a C on the test

280
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,500
and I find that that's so detrimental

281
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,450
because so many of us don't fit into

282
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,740
that model minority I know so many of my

283
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:43,100
friends who are not good at math and

284
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:45,110
honestly I'm only good at math

285
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:47,420
because I stayed before and after class

286
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:49,280
to get tutored on it literally calculus

287
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,070
I remember going in to school at like

288
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:53,420
5:00 a.m. and then leaving at 5:00 p.m.

289
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:55,460
because I just wanted to get tutored on

290
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:57,410
calculus and I've always had a lot of

291
00:11:55,460 --> 00:12:00,080
extra help in the sense that I use Khan

292
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:03,020
Academy and I asked the smartest kid in

293
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:05,240
class to tutor me but that's not to say

294
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:06,950
that I'm naturally gifted at all these

295
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,930
things without trying I find that it's

296
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:11,480
problematic because it really minimizes

297
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:12,890
people's work ethic and the actual sweat

298
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,990
and dedication they put into it as

299
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:18,860
opposed to genetically being predisposed

300
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:20,660
to being good math or schooled another

301
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:25,190
one that I have a hard time grappling

302
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:28,400
with is being this submissive trophy

303
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:31,840
wife and I took a lot of classes of this

304
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:34,190
on this at UCLA Asian American feminism

305
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:36,020
specifically because it was very

306
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:39,110
interesting to see the underpinnings of

307
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:40,790
how Asian American women became this you

308
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:43,340
know submissive trophy wife that's

309
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:45,290
supposed to be sexually promiscuous and

310
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:49,670
also really obedient all at the same

311
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:51,620
time and it's really weird because when

312
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:54,110
I date people outside of my race people

313
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:55,700
will say bla bla bla worshippers so if I

314
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:57,230
date you know like a white man let's say

315
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:00,560
a white man worshipper or if I date

316
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:02,750
someone black like oh you have jungle

317
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,450
fever and I'm just I'm sure a lot of I

318
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:07,580
mean all all races definitely have this

319
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:09,620
being that whole so having that

320
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:11,360
stereotype on you it kind of makes you

321
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:14,600
where when you're dating outside of your

322
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,520
race to know it to try and gauge whether

323
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,930
or not someone has quote-unquote yellow

324
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,550
fever are they asking me out because

325
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:22,310
they have a fetish are they asking me

326
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:25,640
out because they fetishized Asian women

327
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:27,920
and what that entails and for me I have

328
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:30,770
dated all races I know that I've showed

329
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,150
one relationship here on YouTube and you

330
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:33,680
guys probably think that's the only race

331
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:37,400
that I date but I'm a very open-minded

332
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:39,380
person I really truly date all races I

333
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,690
feel like it's more of a for me it's

334
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:44,300
more of a taste issue like do we have

335
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:48,410
similar tastes and in whether that's a

336
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:51,160
music or food or clothes do we have the

337
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:53,300
same taste and taste is definitely

338
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,360
all-inclusive as far as race but I'm

339
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,399
here I'm not here

340
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,160
say oh I don't see race I fly a day all

341
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,990
races saying you don't see race is the

342
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,269
most racist thing you can say being

343
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:05,250
colorblind is being blind to the

344
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:07,680
thousands of years of oppression and

345
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:10,920
systematic incarceration so I'm sorry

346
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:13,130
sister but I totally see race but for me

347
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:15,930
dating wise it's just a tasting so

348
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:18,510
anyways but yeah so just dealing with

349
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:20,279
that is very interesting and I make it a

350
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:23,790
point not to date people who

351
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:25,350
specifically only date Asian women and

352
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:27,029
that's just personal preference to me

353
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:28,829
and also shows that they're not super

354
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:30,420
open-minded like I am so there's a

355
00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:33,839
couple reasons why I don't date people

356
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:35,670
who only date Asian women and I guess it

357
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,829
is because I am a little bit marred from

358
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:40,130
that stereotype actually I'm probably a

359
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:40,130
lot more

360
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:48,640
I speak like that of a four-year-old I

361
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:51,250
can ask for directions I can't order

362
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,210
food ask for more food ask where the

363
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:57,310
bathroom is

364
00:14:52,210 --> 00:15:01,080
but I really can't have a huge

365
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:01,080
conversation in Korean

366
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:07,850
you guys have a bet my entire family now

367
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:08,269
here on YouTube I have videos with my

368
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:11,209
brother

369
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:13,820
my mom and now my dad my last video was

370
00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:15,230
my dad picks my outfits which you guys

371
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,700
can watch up here in the cards it's

372
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:19,220
pretty funny so as you guys might have

373
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:21,470
guessed but I have a very strong and

374
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:23,450
close and positive relationship with

375
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:25,640
both of my parents and I find that

376
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:27,470
that's because one they're super

377
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:30,010
open-minded for being korean-american

378
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:32,600
parents and two they trust me there are

379
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:35,000
definitely some cultural differences and

380
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,910
sometimes politics that don't align but

381
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,269
we both understand and recognize that as

382
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:42,649
a cultural thing and you know creating

383
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:45,019
politics are definitely not as

384
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:48,230
progressive and I consider myself super

385
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:50,690
super liberal I am very very liberal and

386
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:52,610
I'm very open-minded and so hey I think

387
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:54,680
the only thing that sucks about being

388
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:56,870
Korean American is that because I don't

389
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:59,690
speak my language very well I can never

390
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:01,399
ever get to know my dad or really talk

391
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:03,170
about where my family is from like my

392
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:05,360
grandparents my great-grandparents and

393
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:07,670
that really honestly breaks my heart and

394
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,050
if there's any driving force to me

395
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:10,519
learning my language it's so that I

396
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:12,620
could one day sit down and talk to my

397
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:15,649
dog about politics and philosophy

398
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:18,050
because my mom speaks fluent English and

399
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:19,820
so I'm super open with her about the cut

400
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:21,820
we can talk about the economy we can

401
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:24,170
talk about politics we can talk about

402
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:25,880
philosophy we can talk about pretty much

403
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:27,949
anything and I feel super close to her

404
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:31,100
but was my dad it sucks because I can

405
00:16:27,949 --> 00:16:33,290
barely speak about you know what's going

406
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:35,899
on with our current geopolitical climate

407
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:38,149
and I think he's such as wise and smart

408
00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:39,860
and an intellectual guy that it really

409
00:16:38,149 --> 00:16:40,670
makes me sad that I can't talk to him

410
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,959
because he's always reading the

411
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:45,740
newspaper and he seems really really

412
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:47,230
woke in layman's terms but I think

413
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:49,040
that's the biggest thing about being

414
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:50,930
korean-american and the language we're

415
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,420
here is that it really hinders my

416
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:56,380
relationship with both my dad and any

417
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:56,380
one of my grandparents

418
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:04,130
as of today I am 100 150 percent so

419
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:06,920
proud to be korean-american even though

420
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:09,290
I'm so for unity and dismantling of

421
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:11,240
racial segregation I do believe that

422
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:12,380
culture is such a beautiful thing and

423
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,809
culture or something that should be

424
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:17,390
celebrated and it's honestly what makes

425
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:19,970
this world so beautiful and colorful and

426
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:21,589
even if I wasn't Korean I would have if

427
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:23,720
I was Nigerian I would have a Nigeria

428
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:25,400
tattoo if I was Chinese I would have a

429
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,959
Chinese tattoo I think culture is

430
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,360
something and heritage is something that

431
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,799
should be celebrated soon as I hit 18 I

432
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,770
really honed in on what it meant to be

433
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:36,950
Korean American and towards the end of

434
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:39,470
my college career I had a lot of extra

435
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:42,500
classes to take for fun like a lot of

436
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:44,570
units to just basically use up and I

437
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:47,090
think my last corner it was I

438
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:49,370
strategically made it out so that I

439
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:50,990
could only take classes that I really

440
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:53,780
want to so I took an art history class

441
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:55,730
and then all the other ones on the first

442
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:57,740
day it was like what it means to be

443
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:59,750
Korean or asian-american

444
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:02,090
and I took asian-american feminism it's

445
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:03,530
a Korean history formation of Koreatown

446
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:06,020
I think that was the class and then I

447
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:08,000
also took an entire year of the Korean

448
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:09,740
language and I still suck at it but I

449
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,169
never went to class it says he know

450
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:14,120
which in Korean means literally exert

451
00:18:12,169 --> 00:18:16,429
strength but it's something that Korean

452
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:18,770
people say as far as you know like cheer

453
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:21,320
up keep going like endure it like stay

454
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:22,940
strong so you say he knit or white team

455
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,700
fight team it's kind of the same thing

456
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:28,190
and it's basically just saying how for

457
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:30,140
me Korea if you learned about its

458
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:32,000
culture and its politics and its

459
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:33,770
historical background it has been

460
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,140
divided by so many different other

461
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:38,419
external forces and the fact that it

462
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:40,179
still remains and is strong I'm just

463
00:18:38,419 --> 00:18:42,799
like Korean people are resilient and

464
00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:44,330
it's it's just not staying strong and

465
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,940
it's a it's definitely paying homage a

466
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:49,490
lot of omage to my Korean culture I will

467
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:52,340
say that I do not listen to modern-day

468
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:54,679
Korean music because I know a lot of

469
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:57,350
people love kpop but honestly I don't

470
00:18:54,679 --> 00:19:00,320
really listen to even American pop let

471
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:02,690
alone like other people's pop music but

472
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:05,090
if there was like a Korean Stevie Nicks

473
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:05,910
you know I would be down I mean any one

474
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:08,610
of my friends

475
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:10,770
I'm so proud of my culture because when

476
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:14,940
I moved out into my own place here we

477
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:18,240
are I could have lived anywhere in LA

478
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:20,730
any neighborhood in LA because it was my

479
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,740
jurisdiction and of all the places I

480
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:25,590
chose to live in Korea town I live in

481
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:27,150
Koreatown and so many of my friends are

482
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:29,010
like Amy's the ambassador of Koreatown

483
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:31,890
she literally knows every plot every

484
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:33,840
place every pot every sways every spot

485
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:35,790
every place in Koreatown definitely love

486
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,860
Koreatown and I think the reason why I

487
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:39,510
love Korea tells so much I remember even

488
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:41,340
at UCLA I used to drive all the way out

489
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:43,620
from Westwood to Koreatown which is

490
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:45,300
almost like a 40-minute drive with

491
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:48,240
traffic if you guys have been to LA

492
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:49,980
Koreatown is still very Korean it has so

493
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,840
many mom-and-pop shops and pulling the

494
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,670
walls but it's also in the process of

495
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,010
being very gentrified there are so many

496
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:57,720
new high-rise apartment buildings luxury

497
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:59,610
apartment buildings and there are so

498
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,680
many hot spots for going out so many

499
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:04,020
cool bars and so many hipster little

500
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:06,120
cafes shops if you want an Instagram

501
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:08,520
Abul cafe place Koreatown is chock-full

502
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:11,130
of them and so I feel like it's the

503
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:12,420
perfect amalgamation of being Korean and

504
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:13,820
being American and so I feel like

505
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,420
Koreatown is a very strong

506
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:17,700
representation of Who I am

507
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:20,280
it's like I still at my heart have very

508
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:23,460
Korean aspects and at the foundation I

509
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:25,350
am a Korean person but I had a pink

510
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:27,630
gentrified no that's all but a little

511
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:30,680
very traditional but still modern and

512
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:30,680
progressive all at the same time

513
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:35,560
honestly because I love food so much I'm

514
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:39,460
probably just gonna say the food because

515
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:42,580
I can enjoy a nice vegan bowl of kale

516
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:44,650
and quinoa with hummus and couscous but

517
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:47,560
I can also go down for some you know

518
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:52,090
beef table or some bone marrow soup with

519
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:54,850
oxtail and I love that I can enjoy two

520
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:56,830
types of cuisines and really feel at

521
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:58,630
home with both of them because I love

522
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:00,070
food I love Korean food I love American

523
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:01,960
food I love cheeseburgers on front

524
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:06,850
drives I think it kale food I love it

525
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:08,650
all I love it all so that is the end of

526
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:10,660
the tag by the way I wanted to quickly

527
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:12,850
mention one of my favorite TEDTalks it

528
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:14,890
is called I am NOT your Asian stereotype

529
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:16,720
and it touches upon a lot of the topics

530
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:20,020
I talked today but way more eloquently

531
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:22,540
and humorously it is just as humorous as

532
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:24,430
it is cerebral so please watch it I love

533
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:27,280
