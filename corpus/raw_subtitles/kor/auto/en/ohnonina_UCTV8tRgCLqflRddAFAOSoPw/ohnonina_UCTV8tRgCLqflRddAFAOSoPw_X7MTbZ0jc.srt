1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,839
good morning my friends it's actually

2
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:09,570
noon I love my friends it's Nina and I

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:11,550
am currently barefaced as you can tell

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,410
by the title of this video I am doing a

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,809
get ready with me I'm going to do my

6
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,789
makeup with you guys because I'm going

7
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:20,220
to be talking about a certain topic and

8
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:23,640
I need to be doing stuff with my hands

9
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:26,760
so I'm doing my makeup so I was sick for

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,650
like 16 hours I don't know what that was

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,119
I thought I was actually sick I had a

12
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,859
sore throat and all that so I thought I

13
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:33,840
was actually sick and I was really like

14
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:36,300
shook I thought I couldn't film video

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,340
but you know I took one day to rest then

16
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,550
I'm fine now so I don't know what

17
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,540
happened that was a weird experience but

18
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,450
I'm okay for now

19
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,950
my throat is kind of okay my nose I

20
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,539
might sound a little different but

21
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,700
that's fine but as you can tell by the

22
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:53,129
title of this video I am going to be

23
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,930
doing a get ready with me as I talk

24
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:56,399
about a certain topic and I'm gonna talk

25
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,440
about a topic that I feel like is

26
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,910
interesting before you guys and really

27
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:04,019
just explains a lot about me so I am

28
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:07,740
korean-american I was born in America

29
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:10,770
but ethnically my family is entirely

30
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:13,860
from Korea I was the first one born in

31
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:15,780
America and so korean-american I also

32
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,280
don't know what that is I don't know if

33
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,960
it's a pimple or if it's a mosquito bite

34
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,580
whatever it is I haven't touched it

35
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,380
because I'm not dealing with it I'm just

36
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,000
gonna let it heal on its own whatever it

37
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,369
is I don't know what you are but you

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,130
better leave soon my makeup routine is

39
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:31,049
actually really short so I might finish

40
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:34,020
my makeup before I even finish talking

41
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:35,790
about my story so don't mind that just

42
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:39,420
if you're actually getting ready just

43
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:41,340
keep going anyway so about being a

44
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,530
Korean American even though I'm the

45
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,930
first to be born in America I am a

46
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,729
second-generation Korean American now

47
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,549
you're probably wondering how that works

48
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:53,070
well so I was born in America which

49
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:54,600
makes me culturally very American

50
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:57,689
because that's all I've ever known so my

51
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:00,270
dad grew up in Korea he was born there

52
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:02,670
but then when he was nine he moved to

53
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:06,210
the US with his family with his mom and

54
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:08,099
sister and then started a life here

55
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:11,039
so he's considered the first generation

56
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:11,990
or 1.5 generation because he was the one

57
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,630
to really

58
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:17,390
first experience transitioning to the

59
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:19,250
American lifestyle and all that so his

60
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:21,560
story is definitely very different from

61
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:23,690
mine because he was an actual immigrant

62
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:27,170
who came to the US and had to deal with

63
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:29,480
a lot anyway he came here when he was

64
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:31,160
still very young so he was able to pick

65
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,020
up the American culture he had to pick

66
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,940
it up really fast because obviously he

67
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:37,100
needed to blend in with everyone else

68
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:38,540
and he was kind of like he was the new

69
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,250
kid you know there weren't a lot of

70
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:43,100
Asians where he grew up I don't think

71
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:45,710
there were really any Koreans or agents

72
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:48,440
around him but my dad definitely picked

73
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:50,660
up the American culture very fast and he

74
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:54,170
can speak English perfectly

75
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:56,000
he speaks both Korean and English very

76
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:57,920
perfectly the first language he will

77
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,350
speak is English he'll speak Korean if

78
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,090
he has to but otherwise he'll just speak

79
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:03,620
in English he spent literally most of

80
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:05,720
his life in America so he's definitely

81
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:08,450
very Americanized now moving on from

82
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:10,030
that my mom she came to the US for

83
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:12,530
college so she spent her entire

84
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:14,960
adolescence and youth in Korea so

85
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:16,310
culturally she's Korean very Korean I

86
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,620
can't even tell if I finished my BB

87
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:20,600
cream the first language she'll speak

88
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:23,180
its Korean she's culturally very Korean

89
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,950
she only really cares about Korean media

90
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,200
entertainment and culture and all that

91
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:30,380
so the next thing that happened was me

92
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:34,040
being born I was the first of my entire

93
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:37,160
family to be born in the US I was born

94
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:41,240
in California specifically the Bay Area

95
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:42,890
so I was fortunate enough to be growing

96
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,020
up in a place that is very diverse

97
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:47,660
we were very culturally diverse and so I

98
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:50,450
never experienced being the only Asian

99
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:52,850
aren't the only Korean I was literally

100
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:54,620
surrounded by a lot of Asians and a lot

101
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:56,630
of Koreans so I never felt different in

102
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,610
that sense where I grew up specifically

103
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:02,210
in my city there were a lot of Asians so

104
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:04,160
I didn't experience that much racism

105
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:06,230
it was mostly chilled because if you

106
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,660
were a racist you would get attacked so

107
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:10,700
so that was good I didn't go to

108
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:13,330
preschool I spent most of my life at

109
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:16,120
home with my family my mom my

110
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:19,000
my brother my one brother because my

111
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:22,270
other brother was born 14 years after me

112
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,580
so it was first my older younger brother

113
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:27,400
so we were all just together so my

114
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:30,310
childhood before school really was

115
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:33,790
surrounded by my parents and so I was

116
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:35,970
exposed to both Korean and English which

117
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:38,560
honestly got confusing and really

118
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:41,320
affected the way that I grew up because

119
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:44,050
I was having 2 languages spoken to me at

120
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:46,540
the same time it did affect the way that

121
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:48,550
I developed language wise so because I

122
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:51,630
didn't go to preschool I kind of missed

123
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:56,470
out on that first year or two of

124
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:58,450
socializing with other kids when I first

125
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:00,160
went to kindergarten I actually didn't

126
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:01,600
understand the concept of going to

127
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,340
school I honestly didn't know what it

128
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,680
was so when my parents dropped me off on

129
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:07,810
the first day I remember leaving the

130
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,250
classroom with them because I was like

131
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,780
where are they going why are they

132
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,280
leaving me here so I was like following

133
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,200
them but that my parents are like no you

134
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,770
got to stay here and I was like what is

135
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,450
this

136
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,850
but yeah so kindergarten was my first

137
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:21,280
exposure to other kids I was always

138
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:23,260
surrounded by you know like my mom's

139
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,000
friends children but other than that

140
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,650
this was the first time I really had to

141
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,780
be in like a social environment so it

142
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:31,800
was terrifying anyway moving on when I

143
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:35,380
was in school for the first few years I

144
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,880
experienced sort of being behind most of

145
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,200
my peers and that was an obvious thing

146
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,020
because I didn't go to preschool so I

147
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,790
already was behind socially but also

148
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:44,980
education wise I was also behind my

149
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:47,290
peers because I had both English and

150
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:49,840
Korean in my head that I didn't pick up

151
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:51,280
either language well so I couldn't speak

152
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,380
English now while I obviously didn't

153
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,820
know how to read that well all that kind

154
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,770
of stuff so was obviously behind my

155
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:59,590
peers and I was eventually put into an

156
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:01,810
eld program even though my first

157
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:04,300
language was technically never Korean

158
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:06,460
never I never learned Korean and then

159
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,770
forgot it like most people know it was

160
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:11,140
never my first language or anything like

161
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:13,210
that so I was just literally developing

162
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:15,490
slowly just because it was confusing so

163
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:18,370
I was put into LD which really kind of

164
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:21,460
took a toll on my confidence in school I

165
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,760
already felt very behind my peers and it

166
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:24,490
was

167
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:26,680
you know just like a feeling of kind of

168
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:29,530
embarrassment and shame that you know

169
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,720
why am i so behind already

170
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:33,550
and I was like freaking what five you

171
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,250
know give me a break

172
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:38,620
but I was put into LD but I left the

173
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:40,960
program so fast - it was my first year

174
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:44,170
of you know being in a social

175
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,030
environment so I needed time to adjust

176
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:47,950
I had experiences in the past word you

177
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:50,800
know I would experience kids being mean

178
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:53,860
about me not being so smart or not so

179
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,620
you know quick I actually had this one

180
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:58,480
kid make fun of me for being a slow

181
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:01,030
reader and I was like looking back I was

182
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:03,400
like we're in first grade what do you

183
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:04,750
expect from me but there were lots of

184
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,570
moments like that that just kind of

185
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:10,630
really affected my self confidence so

186
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:13,870
growing up for me I became more and more

187
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:16,180
distance from my Korean identity just

188
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:17,620
because as I got older you know I I was

189
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:21,700
going through a lot of physical changes

190
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:24,130
and I just physically didn't look Korean

191
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:27,490
or I didn't fit in that well with my

192
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:30,670
peers I was tall or at least bigger than

193
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:32,530
most Koreans and so I already felt this

194
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:35,830
kind of physical and security but I

195
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:38,860
didn't look Korean and I also as I was

196
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:40,300
growing up because my dad spoke English

197
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:42,370
in the house and because I only went to

198
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,710
American schools I only picked up

199
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:47,470
English I didn't pick up Korean because

200
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:49,420
I wasn't very involved in Korean

201
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:50,740
communities growing up I did have Korean

202
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:52,630
friends growing up and there were a huge

203
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:54,340
part of my life and they still could are

204
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:56,410
but they're all kind of doing their own

205
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,880
things as everyone really does after

206
00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:00,040
high school and all that you know I was

207
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,750
mostly surrounded by Korean and friends

208
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:04,270
just because it was kind of like being

209
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:06,610
with people you can relate to but as I

210
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:08,770
got older personally for me my

211
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:11,860
insecurities were getting a little too

212
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:14,080
out of hand that it started affecting my

213
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:15,970
relationships with not only just other

214
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,010
people but also with myself I was

215
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:19,720
becoming more self-aware as usually one

216
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:22,240
does you know you start to really think

217
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:24,580
about yourself as you grow up I already

218
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,850
carried this insecurity throughout most

219
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:30,130
of my youth of being behind other people

220
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:32,680
just because that's kind of how I grew

221
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:35,590
up I became more and more insecure about

222
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:38,410
me not being able to speak Korean

223
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:40,570
or you know understand Korean etiquette

224
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:44,140
and culture and that kind of stuff and

225
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:46,270
more and more I would make mistakes that

226
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:48,910
kind of really affected my self-esteem

227
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:51,460
you know I went to Korean church and all

228
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:53,800
that but whenever I was part of these

229
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:55,480
communities I felt this personal

230
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,060
detachment from everyone else just

231
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,130
because I felt like again I wasn't

232
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:03,280
blending in I felt like I was lacking

233
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:05,020
something and when I was in these Korean

234
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:07,090
communities they would be able to speak

235
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:08,800
to each other in Korean for fun and I

236
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:11,080
always felt kind of embarrassed that I

237
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,880
couldn't participate like this there was

238
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,830
always this kind of it was really more

239
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,840
of like a personal insecurity that I

240
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:18,640
just couldn't communicate even though it

241
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,810
really didn't matter that much because

242
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,310
you know obviously they could speak

243
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:23,140
English and it was just the thing that

244
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:25,450
they were able to do and obviously my

245
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:28,480
upbringing was different than them so

246
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:30,580
but because I wasn't very confident

247
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,730
myself already it really took a toll on

248
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:35,520
just how I felt about myself and just my

249
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:37,840
identity in that kind of stuff and

250
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:41,140
communicating with Korean adults

251
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:43,240
especially really affected my

252
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:45,070
self-esteem because I wouldn't be able

253
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,230
to communicate with them and it really

254
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:49,480
just felt embarrassing for me that I

255
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:51,310
couldn't speak Korean and I was just

256
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,140
like I just felt like they were judging

257
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:55,360
me and like the way that I grew up like

258
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:58,030
this Korean can't speak Korean what is

259
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,100
she so it was always like a personal

260
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:02,500
kind of feeling I never really

261
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:04,570
complained about it just because I

262
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:07,090
didn't want to or feel like I needed to

263
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:09,520
complain about it but inside it was very

264
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:11,800
it was just disappointing for me that I

265
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,690
couldn't participate like this and you

266
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,330
know everyone else could blend in so

267
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:18,760
easily between being an American and

268
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:21,220
being Korean and for me I couldn't

269
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:23,170
really identify with being Korean

270
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,670
because I honestly couldn't relate to

271
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:26,110
the culture or speak the language so it

272
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:27,970
really was just kind of it was just

273
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:30,370
frustrating really I was already a

274
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:31,960
pretty socially anxious person so this

275
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:35,830
adding onto that kind of really just

276
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:37,900
made knowing who I was really difficult

277
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:40,540
eventually this insecurity of not

278
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:42,670
blending in with my peers really got to

279
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:45,280
me and I just kind of detached myself

280
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:47,350
from these communities just because I

281
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:49,250
already felt like I didn't belong even

282
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:51,650
though it really didn't

283
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:53,360
have to go to that extent it's just

284
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:55,610
personally it got to a point where it

285
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,220
kind of needed to leave because I didn't

286
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:59,990
feel great about not being able to

287
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:02,300
communicate my own language firstly I

288
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:04,670
already felt physically different from

289
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,740
other Koreans just because I have

290
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:09,320
naturally curly hair which is kind of

291
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:11,750
strange for an East Asian especially for

292
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:14,210
a Korean was really bright I honestly

293
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:16,340
still don't know how I have curly wavy

294
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:17,690
hair physically I already felt like I

295
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:20,240
didn't belong and then culturally I

296
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:23,120
obviously didn't belong in that sense so

297
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:26,120
I was just like then what makes me a

298
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,980
Korean and so at that time I really

299
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,500
didn't understand the concept of it so

300
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:32,480
it really just really got to my

301
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,670
self-confidence my self-esteem because I

302
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,080
really didn't know how to deal with it

303
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:38,060
so in high school I was surrounded by a

304
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,740
different social group because my

305
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:41,720
friends were moving around people were

306
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,910
you know moving on that kind of stuff so

307
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:48,290
naturally I went to a new friend group

308
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:50,180
and my friend group was entirely not

309
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,890
Korean just because that's how things

310
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:54,350
turned out okay see so I already

311
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:56,510
finished my makeup actually I should do

312
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:58,270
my mascara so naturally I just had this

313
00:11:56,510 --> 00:12:01,220
different friend group that was not

314
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:04,070
Korean so I didn't really have that

315
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,690
opportunity to be immersed in Korean

316
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:08,210
culture just because there was really no

317
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:10,340
tie to it other than obviously my

318
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:11,660
parents and my family and all that and

319
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:15,200
nothing in my life really

320
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:17,980
urged me to you know be connected to my

321
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,090
Korean side I was very much immersed in

322
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:23,060
Western culture you know I was watching

323
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:26,240
programs from the UK and stuff from

324
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:27,860
America American TV shows that kind of

325
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,660
stuff obviously because I'm an American

326
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:31,750
so that's what I was kind of into I

327
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:35,030
didn't I didn't pay much attention to

328
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:37,580
Korean media at all I wasn't watching

329
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:39,380
Korean dramas or listening to kpop or

330
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:41,420
anything in my in high school really

331
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:43,640
because that wasn't part of my social

332
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:45,620
circle my social environment so through

333
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:48,710
that time I was really just not

334
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:50,240
emotionally connected to myself I was

335
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:51,830
really kind of living every single day

336
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,930
just to get to the next day and

337
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:56,330
eventually graduate and you know I was

338
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:58,310
just having fun I was very much still

339
00:12:56,330 --> 00:13:00,290
kind of insecure in high school but at

340
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:01,850
that point I wasn't letting it control

341
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:03,769
my life or affect

342
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:06,410
I felt living my life and so in high

343
00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:08,149
school I really didn't think about being

344
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:10,430
Korean it wasn't just like something I

345
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:12,880
had to worry about the crucial point in

346
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:16,639
my journey of being korean-american

347
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:19,190
really happened in my last year of high

348
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:22,730
school and on from that so there was a

349
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:25,910
personal situation that affected my

350
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:28,190
entire family and myself especially and

351
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:31,910
it was in my last year of high school

352
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:34,910
when my great-grandma who was a huge

353
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:39,199
part of my family really she was dealing

354
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:45,470
with Alzheimer's and she was getting old

355
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:47,480
and she was in the hospital and why did

356
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:50,089
I put mascara on I probably should have

357
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:52,970
put mascara on after this this was

358
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:57,980
really wrong timing in the last part of

359
00:13:52,970 --> 00:14:00,440
2014 / 2015 my great-grandma was in the

360
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:03,259
hospital dealing with Alzheimer's we

361
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,940
only got to visit my grandma about once

362
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,630
a year just because she lived in a

363
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,939
different state

364
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:10,370
she lived in America that's how my mom

365
00:14:07,939 --> 00:14:12,759
was able to come to the u.s. because my

366
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:16,100
great-grandma also came but my

367
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:18,040
great-grandma was sick and she was

368
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:20,630
dealing with Alzheimer's so she already

369
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:22,790
couldn't really remember who we were and

370
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:25,910
because we were only able to visit her

371
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:28,040
once a year we didn't know how she was

372
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:31,670
doing we didn't know that she got to

373
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:34,579
this point and and so she was in the

374
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:38,089
hospital and this was the first time I

375
00:14:34,579 --> 00:14:42,560
was dealing with a family member being

376
00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:45,139
sick and at this stage in life and it

377
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:51,800
really was kind of surreal for me just

378
00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:54,019
because just because I didn't know how

379
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,529
to deal with it because throughout high

380
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:56,089
school

381
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:58,100
you know I didn't worry about this kind

382
00:14:56,089 --> 00:15:02,389
of stuff even though you know obviously

383
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:04,550
time was passing and for me it was just

384
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:06,829
I it was something I couldn't comprehend

385
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:09,010
but when I visited her at the hospital

386
00:15:06,829 --> 00:15:12,559
it started to hit me that you know she

387
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:14,690
didn't remember us and after being so

388
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:16,670
careless about not about myself

389
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:19,580
but you know not really thinking about

390
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:21,830
myself at a deeper level suddenly it was

391
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:26,810
all kind of hitting me at the same time

392
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:30,200
that so much time passed and there was

393
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:34,730
so much that I wanted to do I didn't

394
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:37,370
think about why did I wear mascara so at

395
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:39,680
this point my grandma didn't really

396
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:42,170
remember us that well my great-grandma

397
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:45,140
by the way is my mom's grandma so she

398
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:46,700
was a very huge part of her life you

399
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:48,680
know she basically raised her my

400
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:50,720
great-grandma was a huge part of my life

401
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:53,570
as well when I was younger I would look

402
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,670
forward to her staying over with us you

403
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:58,250
know even though there was this literal

404
00:15:55,670 --> 00:16:00,260
language barrier she was a huge part of

405
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:02,510
my childhood and I would be excited

406
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:04,010
whenever she would stay with us and when

407
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:07,130
she would brush my hair every single

408
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:10,040
morning even though my hair you're not

409
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:11,630
really supposed to brush it like the way

410
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,670
that she did she didn't really

411
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:16,250
understand that you know curly hair

412
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:17,750
you're not supposed to brush it with a

413
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:19,130
certain brush and she didn't really

414
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:21,230
understand that but she still did

415
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:23,780
because she wanted to make my hair nice

416
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:25,940
and pretty and so there was that

417
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:28,160
cultural difference that always made me

418
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:30,890
kind of laugh as I got older as I

419
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,260
understood my hair more but um so she

420
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:35,930
was a huge part of my life but the thing

421
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:39,340
that kind of really hit me when all this

422
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:42,970
was happening was the fact that I

423
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:47,060
realized I never really had a full

424
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:51,220
conversation with her nor do I even

425
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:51,220
remember having a conversation with her

426
00:16:55,060 --> 00:17:03,200
so this sort of guilt started Wow okay

427
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:05,720
okay okay oh stop so this sense of guilt

428
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:08,150
was kind of just jumping out at me from

429
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:10,579
nowhere because I didn't think about it

430
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:12,410
I kind of took it for granted I always

431
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:14,030
for some reason thought my grandma was

432
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:17,510
just gonna be around for a long time and

433
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:20,750
this overwhelming sense of guilt kind of

434
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:22,579
just came at me and I was like I really

435
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:25,100
never had a conversation with her

436
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:27,860
because she can't speak English

437
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:30,890
I never bothered to speak with her in

438
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:37,090
Korean because I couldn't and so that

439
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:39,049
was really when I started realizing yeah

440
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:41,360
literally I don't know why I did my

441
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:44,600
makeup I should just left my face bare I

442
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,580
also just felt helpless because at this

443
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:49,669
point there was nothing I could do she

444
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:52,490
already didn't remember who we were so

445
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:54,140
it really was just a hopeless time that

446
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:57,650
you know there was nothing I could do at

447
00:17:54,140 --> 00:18:01,220
this point except be there for her as

448
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:03,080
much as possible and from then on that's

449
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:06,080
kind of when I took myself more

450
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:09,140
seriously and really thought about how

451
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,669
you know I can't really be distracted

452
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:13,070
from myself anymore I really should

453
00:18:10,669 --> 00:18:15,260
think more because things changed so

454
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:18,320
fast so few months later my great

455
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:20,780
grandma did pass away that was kind of

456
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:23,000
the end of that part of my life

457
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:25,039
so that's kind of when you know I became

458
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,110
more self reflexive and started really

459
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:29,210
taking myself more seriously because I

460
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:31,490
was really away from this part of me

461
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:32,840
that you know I could have spent more

462
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:34,850
time on so it was just a very

463
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:37,070
frustrating time because at the time too

464
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:39,169
I was still dealing with insecurities

465
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:41,780
that I kind of pushed back so moving on

466
00:18:39,169 --> 00:18:43,490
from that I graduated high school it was

467
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:45,830
my last year of high school when this

468
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:47,270
happened so I was about to finish high

469
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:50,510
school so I finished high school

470
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:52,190
and this was when you know I finally was

471
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:54,620
going to college being independent

472
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:56,750
really learning a lot being by myself

473
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:58,820
that kind of stuff and because I was

474
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:00,169
being more self reflexive because I was

475
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:02,419
analyzing all my life will have been

476
00:19:00,169 --> 00:19:05,330
more this is kind of when the process

477
00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:08,270
happened when I started becoming more

478
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:10,909
aware of my background and everything in

479
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:12,980
college I learned a whole lot more about

480
00:19:10,909 --> 00:19:14,210
you know the self and all that I was

481
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:16,039
taking a lot of psychology classes

482
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:17,570
sociology classes all that kind of stuff

483
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:19,460
really just being more exposed to

484
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:21,950
everything and I was just becoming more

485
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:24,890
educated about a person so I was being

486
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:27,200
more self reflexive and more empathetic

487
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:29,809
at this point because before I didn't

488
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,400
really care so much about these deeper

489
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:34,190
things you know I was kind of just going

490
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:36,710
through the motions just trying to get

491
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:38,119
their life that I never really thought

492
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:40,999
about people

493
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:43,609
or myself or anything at a deeper sense

494
00:19:40,999 --> 00:19:46,549
so in college I was becoming more aware

495
00:19:43,609 --> 00:19:49,189
of how you know people work just I'm not

496
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:50,359
a psychology majors I'm not an expert at

497
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:52,729
this kind of stuff but I was definitely

498
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:55,339
becoming more exposed to it so my mom

499
00:19:52,729 --> 00:19:57,049
never really showed us how my

500
00:19:55,339 --> 00:19:59,959
great-grandma passing away affected her

501
00:19:57,049 --> 00:20:02,059
I I assumed she was heartbroken because

502
00:19:59,959 --> 00:20:03,949
obviously if I was heartbroken she would

503
00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:07,699
have been much more broken but I never

504
00:20:03,949 --> 00:20:10,099
really realized how much this affected

505
00:20:07,699 --> 00:20:12,229
her until she told me as I got older my

506
00:20:10,099 --> 00:20:14,689
parents would just talk to me about more

507
00:20:12,229 --> 00:20:16,459
things and you know relate to me on a

508
00:20:14,689 --> 00:20:18,649
personal level that kind of stuff and

509
00:20:16,459 --> 00:20:21,559
there was this one day when my mom told

510
00:20:18,649 --> 00:20:23,599
me how much you know how important my

511
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:26,269
great-grandma was to her and it was

512
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:28,099
because my great-grandma she spoke only

513
00:20:26,269 --> 00:20:30,379
Korean you know she was culturally very

514
00:20:28,099 --> 00:20:33,589
Korean so this was kind of how my mom

515
00:20:30,379 --> 00:20:35,179
was able to connect to Korea and connect

516
00:20:33,589 --> 00:20:37,639
to your old family and so when my great

517
00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:40,579
grandma passed away that kind of side of

518
00:20:37,639 --> 00:20:42,319
my mom just kind of vanished and it just

519
00:20:40,579 --> 00:20:43,909
felt a little more lonely for her and I

520
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:46,429
never realized that because I always

521
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:48,229
kind of took her speaking English being

522
00:20:46,429 --> 00:20:50,089
able to speak two languages being able

523
00:20:48,229 --> 00:20:51,169
to switch from culture to culture I took

524
00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:53,329
that for granted

525
00:20:51,169 --> 00:20:55,579
and I didn't realize that it's still

526
00:20:53,329 --> 00:20:57,049
hard for her to understand American

527
00:20:55,579 --> 00:20:59,569
culture even though she's able to speak

528
00:20:57,049 --> 00:21:01,819
English that doesn't mean she's part of

529
00:20:59,569 --> 00:21:03,019
the American culture so when my dad and

530
00:21:01,819 --> 00:21:04,939
I are speaking to each other we can

531
00:21:03,019 --> 00:21:06,169
speak for a long time about anything

532
00:21:04,939 --> 00:21:08,389
because we actually understand the

533
00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:10,399
context and all that but my mom she

534
00:21:08,389 --> 00:21:12,949
sometimes doesn't understand that it's

535
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:15,109
just like how I'm not able to understand

536
00:21:12,949 --> 00:21:17,389
or I wasn't able to understand you know

537
00:21:15,109 --> 00:21:19,249
Korean culture and etiquette and I felt

538
00:21:17,389 --> 00:21:21,229
that shame and that embarrassment and

539
00:21:19,249 --> 00:21:23,359
that detachment but I never pieced it

540
00:21:21,229 --> 00:21:25,429
together and saw my mom was experiencing

541
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:27,439
the same thing but kind of the other way

542
00:21:25,429 --> 00:21:31,339
around and so at this point I realized

543
00:21:27,439 --> 00:21:33,889
that my mom too was very heavily

544
00:21:31,339 --> 00:21:36,259
affected by my great grandma passing and

545
00:21:33,889 --> 00:21:37,999
this kind of side to her was kind of

546
00:21:36,259 --> 00:21:40,699
gone and she didn't really have someone

547
00:21:37,999 --> 00:21:42,109
she can fully 100% communicate with

548
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:44,119
heart to heart even though she had

549
00:21:42,109 --> 00:21:45,949
family here there was still the cultural

550
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:48,919
difference no matter what and it really

551
00:21:45,949 --> 00:21:50,750
was just difficult to understand but

552
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:53,900
because I was becoming

553
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:56,890
are aware of things outside of myself I

554
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:59,750
started to really see the value in

555
00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:01,190
owning my Korean identity and you know

556
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,900
being part of my culture because it's

557
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:05,330
not just being able to speak a language

558
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:07,070
or not it really affected me at a much

559
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:09,140
more personal level because I realized

560
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:11,210
that if I'm not able to speak Korean if

561
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:13,670
I'm not able to have a sense of Korean

562
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:16,550
culture I'm gonna have this distance

563
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:20,210
from my mom as well and I didn't want

564
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:22,490
that I just got tired of this distance

565
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:25,340
and this detachment just looking back I

566
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:27,770
wish I was just more secure of myself so

567
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:29,450
I could just be part of it because you

568
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:31,550
know being distant from your culture it

569
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:33,320
really is a lonely feeling and so at

570
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:35,420
this point because I was really by

571
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:38,180
myself and I had nothing to lose

572
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:39,800
I wanted to immerse myself more in the

573
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:41,780
Korean culture because I didn't want my

574
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,910
mom to feel so lonely and for myself I

575
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:45,620
didn't want to feel detached anymore and

576
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:47,000
at this point social media was becoming

577
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,570
a bigger thing you know I had the

578
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,310
Internet

579
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:51,020
I finally had these resources around me

580
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:54,320
that I was like I think it's time to

581
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:56,420
just own it and just immerse myself more

582
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,700
because I really had nothing to lose I

583
00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:01,160
would only be able to gain this part of

584
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:03,500
me that I was always kind of afraid to

585
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:05,390
gain and kind of always far front even

586
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,460
if people might not think I'm a Korean

587
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:09,170
even if I'm not able to communicate with

588
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:11,960
other Koreans or relate to them no

589
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:14,210
matter what it's still 100% a part of me

590
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:16,040
my entire family is from Korea even

591
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:18,380
though I was born in America it's still

592
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:20,900
100% part of me even if other people

593
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:23,390
don't think so it's still Who I am and

594
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:25,640
that kind of just took too long for me

595
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:27,440
to realize sorry my camera died but

596
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:29,900
anyway there was just nothing stopping

597
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:34,700
me from finally being immersed in my

598
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:35,840
culture I was 19 and I became much more

599
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,270
aware of myself

600
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:41,030
and all that that I just didn't want to

601
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:43,820
be ashamed anymore of trying to be

602
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:46,610
myself you know obviously growing up I

603
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:48,890
may have you know developed slowly I may

604
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:51,680
have not been able to personally relate

605
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:54,500
with other Koreans but that was when I

606
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:56,930
was younger and I can't let that affect

607
00:23:54,500 --> 00:24:00,200
my life anymore so from then on I

608
00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:01,370
decided to finally start learning Korean

609
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,040
because I finally had

610
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:06,800
I had resources to finally teach myself

611
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:10,280
Korean but also an important part of me

612
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:13,430
finally being proud of my Korean

613
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:16,340
identity was definitely kpop my parents

614
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:18,680
have always exposed me to kpop you know

615
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:21,590
I grew up with BIGBANG and Girls

616
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:23,630
Generation I knew about kpop since I was

617
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:26,600
a kid but I never there wasn't really

618
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:28,850
the stand culture of kpop in high school

619
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,980
obviously things have changed and kpop

620
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:32,630
is a huge thing now but when I was in

621
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:34,250
high school even though it wasn't really

622
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:36,230
that long ago there wasn't that kind of

623
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:38,510
culture so I wasn't able to you know

624
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:42,740
really be immersed in kpop and actually

625
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:45,350
my mom introduced me to BTS which was my

626
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:47,510
first k-pop group that I really started

627
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:48,770
standing my mom actually introduced me

628
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:49,940
to them because it was the Billboard

629
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:53,090
Music Awards and my mom was talking

630
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:56,780
about BTS getting the nomination all and

631
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:58,460
I was like huh kpop cool and then I just

632
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:01,130
for some reason I wanted to check them

633
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:02,809
out and then it changed my life but

634
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:05,840
because of that it was kind of this

635
00:25:02,809 --> 00:25:08,150
gateway into Korean culture I started

636
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,280
watching more Korean dramas listening to

637
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:12,260
more Korean artists in general just

638
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,510
finally being able to find stuff to

639
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:15,920
relate to with my mom my mom was always

640
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:17,090
watching these Korean dramas and all

641
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,040
that and I never knew what she was

642
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:20,870
watching her and talking about now I

643
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,940
actually understood and it kind of just

644
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:24,890
felt nice that I was able to finally

645
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:27,290
relate to my mom in some kind of sense

646
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:29,210
obviously k-pops not the epitome of

647
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:31,280
Korean culture but it definitely is a

648
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:33,860
part of it and it helped me kind of be

649
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:35,750
more exposed to whatever my mom cared

650
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:38,360
about and I'm very much in love with all

651
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:40,130
of it and it definitely shaped me to

652
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:42,470
become the person I am today for the

653
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:45,110
last year and a half I've been learning

654
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:47,390
Korean and I'm definitely better I still

655
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:49,280
have a slight insecurity about it just

656
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:51,320
because growing up you know I used to

657
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:53,330
get teased for trying to speak Korean

658
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:55,040
that kind of stuff there still I'm not

659
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:57,140
perfect there's still that underlying

660
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:58,670
insecurity oh if I speak Korean it's

661
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:00,740
gonna be embarrassing so even though I

662
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:02,270
don't speak Korean all the time you know

663
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:04,130
I speak it with my mom and I speak it

664
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:06,200
was my dad sometimes but I'm definitely

665
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:09,080
able to understand it more now I'm

666
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:11,900
actually able to speak to my grandma my

667
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:13,760
dad's mom in Korean because we always

668
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:15,780
spoke in English to her and we never

669
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,950
bothered to try to speak

670
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:18,960
in my first few months that I was

671
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:21,990
learning Korean I surprised her by

672
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:25,590
suddenly starting to speak Korean and

673
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:28,080
she was so surprised she was so happy

674
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:29,340
and really appreciative that I was

675
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,650
actually learning Korean and it was

676
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:33,360
really just such a nice experience I

677
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:35,310
want to be able to make my family's life

678
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:38,160
easier because even though we're all in

679
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:39,570
America it wouldn't kill me to speak in

680
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,490
Korean with them and just make their

681
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:44,250
lives a little bit easier but that it's

682
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:47,010
really my experience so far growing up

683
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:49,650
korean-american I was very much afraid

684
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:51,000
to be connected to that side of me

685
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:53,280
because I always felt like I wasn't

686
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,990
enough and I felt like I couldn't relate

687
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,610
to other people this doesn't just have

688
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:59,430
to do with being korean-american this

689
00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:01,380
applies to anyone who is a child of

690
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:04,230
immigrant parents coming to a country

691
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:06,630
where you know you're not the dominant

692
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:08,340
people it can be very difficult to know

693
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:11,850
who you are because you may not feel

694
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:13,890
confident enough to own your ethnical

695
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:16,230
background but you obviously physically

696
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:18,780
don't fit in with everyone else and it's

697
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:21,270
just really weird and hard and it really

698
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:23,910
can affect you negatively but there's

699
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:26,460
really just nothing wrong with

700
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:28,650
identifying as the ethnicity that you

701
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:30,660
really are I only gained more by

702
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:32,370
identifying with this part of me like

703
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:34,320
there was nothing that I lost from it

704
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:37,740
this journey so far of learning is just

705
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:40,860
so eye opening and rewarding I still

706
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:42,960
obviously don't always 100% feel Korean

707
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:44,220
it's still you know I it's still hard

708
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,480
for me to blend in with the Korean

709
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:47,430
community especially in my school

710
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,720
there's a huge Korean community but you

711
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:51,330
know obviously there are some

712
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:56,340
differences but now I'm just not taking

713
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:57,810
it so personally because oh well and

714
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:00,390
also lately in Korea they've been

715
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:03,720
styling their hair to kind of make it

716
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:06,390
wavy and it kind of just makes me feel

717
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:08,070
both happy but also triggered at the

718
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:10,620
same time because I always used to be so

719
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:12,630
ashamed not ashamed but like I used to

720
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:15,450
you know kind of be sad that my hair

721
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:18,330
wasn't straight but you know now people

722
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:23,070
are appreciating different hair styles

723
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:25,920
and so that's nice I guess but now it's

724
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:27,570
just I'm not afraid to be in touch with

725
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,460
my Korean side there's nothing wrong

726
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:31,370
with

727
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:33,560
identifying as my ethnicity that was my

728
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:36,860
experience growing up as korean-american

729
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:39,410
and honestly the past 20 years have been

730
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:42,080
a lot but it's been a lot of growth and

731
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:43,940
there's just a lot more for me to learn

732
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,370
and it's just a nice journey and it's a

733
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:48,530
lot of fun I hope that you guys can also

734
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:52,310
if you're also dealing with something

735
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:54,380
like this you can not be afraid to be in

736
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:57,770
touch with your ethnicity even if people

737
00:28:54,380 --> 00:29:00,350
don't think you're enough who cares this

738
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:02,720
is my background this is who I am I'm

739
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:05,810
going to do as much as I can on my part

740
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,820
to learn about my ethnicity and own my

741
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:09,920
nationality as well people should learn

742
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:12,830
more than one language honestly the

743
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:14,570
