00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:14,040
hello everyone and welcome back to my

3
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:17,130
channel

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,800
it has been a hot minute since I've just

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,900
sat down turn the camera on and talk to

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,699
you guys one on one but today's video is

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,609
going to be a very special video that

8
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:28,920
I've been wanting to make for quite some

9
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:31,399
time now so in today's video I want to

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,559
talk about my journey growing up as

11
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:37,320
korean-american I felt very inspired by

12
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,930
watching Jenn's video Whaley's video

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,899
Amy's video it's really cool to hear

14
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,550
their story and how they overcame

15
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:46,649
certain obstacles in their life hearing

16
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:50,280
about their struggles I feel like I can

17
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:52,800
relate to them so much because a lot of

18
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,899
our stories are very parallel but I

19
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,239
still felt like even though there are

20
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,820
similarities it's important to share my

21
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:02,100
story and I and I would love to kind of

22
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,409
just open up to you guys about some

23
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,570
personal things in my life and just

24
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:08,880
going up Korean American so if you're

25
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:11,369
interested on hearing my journey then

26
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,229
keep on watching okay I just feel like I

27
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:15,420
need to relax

28
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:17,009
I'm just so uptight right now and I

29
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,960
think it's because I haven't just sat

30
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:22,229
here and talked to the camera in a while

31
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,810
and it just feels a little overwhelming

32
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:26,790
but it's okay I just want good energy

33
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,590
and I just want this would be super

34
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,320
casual and I really want to open up to

35
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:33,000
you guys about just my childhood so I

36
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,750
guess we should begin with question

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,509
number one

38
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:39,659
I am korean-american born and raised in

39
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:42,659
Virginia I am first generation my

40
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:45,149
parents moved to America when they were

41
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:47,759
young I'm not sure exactly how old they

42
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:51,329
were but they moved to America and then

43
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,070
had me and my sister Robin Robin is two

44
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:55,170
years older than me so we are pretty

45
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:59,490
close in age so I grew up in a small

46
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:01,979
town called Prince George and I spent

47
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,540
most of my childhood there just to give

48
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:06,299
you a little background about where I'm

49
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:09,179
from it was predominantly black or white

50
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:13,500
people and there were not a lot of

51
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:17,760
Asians at all I probably went to school

52
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:20,070
six or seven Asians and that's literally

53
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:24,570
me not even exaggerating it was a small

54
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:27,570
town so they're just yeah there wasn't a

55
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:30,330
lot of Asians so the first time I felt

56
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:34,290
like I was different or that I was a

57
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:38,190
minority was probably in middle school I

58
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:42,750
remember being called pancake face all

59
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:44,370
the time and I don't even remember the

60
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,170
very first time that I've heard it

61
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,370
because I've heard it so many times it's

62
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,620
almost like a blur

63
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:52,920
at first I never understood what they

64
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:55,290
were talking about because my face just

65
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,910
I don't know I didn't really get what it

66
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:59,520
meant I knew that I look different but I

67
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:01,920
wasn't sure what they were saying but

68
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:04,350
then I finally caught on and what they

69
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,730
were trying to say is that I have a very

70
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:11,790
flat profile so if you catch me at my

71
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:14,459
side angle you can see that my forehead

72
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:16,470
is quite pushed in I don't have like a

73
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:18,180
prominent forehead and like my eyes

74
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:20,489
don't come out everything is just a

75
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,470
little bit more on the flatter side even

76
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:25,380
the back of my head which you obviously

77
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:29,730
can't see but you can feel it it's very

78
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:31,769
flat at the top it doesn't feel like mmm

79
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:33,630
how do I explain this it just doesn't

80
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:36,000
feel like it comes out like a normal

81
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:39,630
head would but yeah I know that some

82
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,430
Asians have this not all Asians but a

83
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:44,820
lot of Asians have more of a flatter

84
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:46,680
profile and that's what I had it was

85
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,150
very different on my school for kids to

86
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,600
see because like I mentioned there were

87
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:53,459
only a few Asian so they were just used

88
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,950
to seeing what they were used to seeing

89
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:58,080
I feel like if no one ever mentioned it

90
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:00,450
I would have never even thought about it

91
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,510
but getting that drilled in my head as a

92
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:07,049
kid that I have a really flat face I

93
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:09,360
think that it became such a huge

94
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:12,480
insecurity of mine as I got older that

95
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,730
was probably just one of the names that

96
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,680
people called me I mean a lot of kids

97
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:19,140
would joke about my eyes and my eye

98
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:22,560
shape one being that they're small so I

99
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:25,440
would get called eyes and

100
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:30,060
secondly because I have

101
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:36,180
true monolids I have no lid as a crease

102
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:38,580
it's just one slab of skin so I would

103
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,980
get made fun of about that another story

104
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:44,070
which was very similar to Whaley and

105
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:46,560
Jen's was that I also brought Korean

106
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:51,330
food for lunch I think this was like

107
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:53,490
third grade and I remember my mom packed

108
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:55,770
me like rice with kimchi and some other

109
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:57,330
punch ends I it's kind of a blur so I

110
00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:00,690
don't remember exactly but there for

111
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:02,960
sure was kimchi in there and I remember

112
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:04,890
opening my lunch at school and

113
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,000
immediately when my friend smelled

114
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:09,210
kimchi

115
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,950
they were so disgusted and they were

116
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:13,500
just making fun of me and saying that it

117
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:16,650
smells so bad like farts or they were

118
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:19,890
just going in about my kimchi I also

119
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:21,870
felt very humiliated and embarrassed and

120
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:23,130
I was a kid that's just something you

121
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,380
don't want to be teased about like the

122
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:27,510
food you eat I didn't finish my lunch

123
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:29,370
and I remember telling my mom I do not

124
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:32,640
want to bring Korean food to school ever

125
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:34,410
again I remember seeing the food that my

126
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,660
friend's parents would pack and it was

127
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:39,720
just you know traditional like cheese

128
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:42,690
and ham sandwiches and like a fruit

129
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:45,480
roll-up for dessert and I would just be

130
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:47,370
so envious of their lunch and thinking

131
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:50,130
to myself like why can't my parents make

132
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:52,140
this like why do their parents pack them

133
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:54,830
such great meals and I get packed like

134
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:59,520
this you know I wanted so badly to

135
00:05:54,830 --> 00:06:02,430
eat American food and just be normal

136
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:06,450
I was definitely not proud of my

137
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:08,790
heritage through my childhood even high

138
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:13,560
school years that wasn't something that

139
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:16,080
I was able to feel until I moved to LA

140
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:19,320
during middle school junior high and

141
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,630
high school I hated the fact that I was

142
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:24,090
Korean because I was a minority and I

143
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:26,970
think that there was a lack of culture

144
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:28,919
in my hometown it was really hard to

145
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:32,130
deal with like I mentioned earlier there

146
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:33,450
was either the white kids or the black

147
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:36,390
kids and it wasn't like they were

148
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:38,760
segregated but I found that they really

149
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:41,250
kind of stuck to their own

150
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:43,980
that's just how it was in my school not

151
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:46,140
that I agree with it or anything but it

152
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:47,190
was like if you were white you kind of

153
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,840
hung out with the white kids and if you

154
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:51,330
were black you hung out with the black

155
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:55,590
kids and for me as a minority I didn't

156
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:58,800
know where I belonged and it was a very

157
00:06:55,590 --> 00:07:01,140
confusing time but I found that I was

158
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,250
kicking it with the black kids more and

159
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:04,020
I hope you guys don't get offended by

160
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,700
that I don't mean anything negative when

161
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:09,360
I see black or white I'm just trying to

162
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:11,580
explain what it was at my school so with

163
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,370
that being said I had a lot of black

164
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:17,580
friends and it was great like I I

165
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:19,800
connected with them and I felt like I

166
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:21,930
started to make a lot of friendships

167
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:25,560
during like junior high and then high

168
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:29,100
school but I think I definitely got lost

169
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:33,150
in just knowing who I was as a person

170
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:36,990
and owning my culture I got into a lot

171
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:40,110
of trouble as a kid and I was not the

172
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:42,750
traditional Korean student that my

173
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:47,600
parents wanted me to be and because of

174
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:50,760
that it sparked a lot of resentment and

175
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:54,690
arguments with my parents my parents are

176
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:57,990
super traditional they wanted the good

177
00:07:54,690 --> 00:08:02,760
grades they wanted school first no

178
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:05,640
social life they wanted me to have Asian

179
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:07,650
friends and it's like they knew that

180
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,300
there weren't that many at my school and

181
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:12,120
it's quite impossible to force yourself

182
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:14,340
to make a connection with them maybe six

183
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,810
or seven Asian kids at your school and

184
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:18,030
they're all in different grades at that

185
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:20,700
and I'm just I wasn't trying to force

186
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:22,680
anything and just be friends with who I

187
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:25,440
naturally connect with so with my

188
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:29,000
parents being super traditional and my

189
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:32,150
sister and I being very rebellious it

190
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,940
caused a lot of tension in the house

191
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:39,860
throughout my childhood I mean we didn't

192
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:44,490
see eye to eye with them on anything and

193
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:48,210
that really caused us to lie to my

194
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:51,600
parents every single day of my junior

195
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:52,990
high and high school life so being

196
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,430
rebellious I would

197
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,259
lie to my parents and say yeah I'm

198
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:57,879
getting tutored after school and I'd be

199
00:08:56,259 --> 00:08:59,920
at a basketball game like I wasn't even

200
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:02,740
allowed to go to a basketball game that

201
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,389
was at my school so I just want to add

202
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:06,660
this story in here because I think it's

203
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:09,610
very important on my childhood and

204
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:13,509
explains why my parents were the way

205
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:15,220
they were so my parents came to America

206
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:17,170
when they were very young and then and

207
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:19,149
had been my sister when they came to

208
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:20,829
America they only had five dollars

209
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:25,930
my dad had five dollars in his pocket

210
00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:29,019
and somehow someway they became

211
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:31,810
entrepreneurs and it's not obviously

212
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:34,000
like the entrepreneur business guy that

213
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:38,560
you're thinking they had to do a lot of

214
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,230
the the really hard labor work that put

215
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,790
in a lot of hours and I just kind of

216
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:45,250
want to mention a few of the things that

217
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:47,800
they've done so when I was in like

218
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:50,740
elementary and middle school they owned

219
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:53,560
a convenience store called Chang's

220
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:55,990
Food Mart and this store was in

221
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:59,800
Petersburg Virginia it used to have the

222
00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:01,870
highest crime rate in Virginia and it is

223
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:04,029
a bit different now certain parts of

224
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:06,550
Petersburg will always be rough but it

225
00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:09,399
over the years it has gotten a lot

226
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:12,790
better but back then when my parents

227
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:14,920
owned the store it was pretty rough so

228
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:17,199
yeah they had their first convenience

229
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,819
store and I remember as a kid just being

230
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:21,250
in the store all the time and there's

231
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:24,790
photos of my mom literally carrying me

232
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:27,339
and her little carrier like punching the

233
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:30,370
cashier and literally full-on working

234
00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:32,680
while raising me as a kid so that store

235
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:34,779
they had for quite a bit of time I

236
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:37,990
remember one day my mom calls me my

237
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:39,939
sister and says that we have to sleep

238
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:41,589
over are one of our best friends house

239
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:43,839
who was Elena and you guys have seen

240
00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:46,569
Elena in my vlog I literally grew up

241
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,819
with her but she told us to stay over

242
00:10:46,569 --> 00:10:50,860
there and coming from my mom that was

243
00:10:48,819 --> 00:10:52,930
like what do you want us to sleep over

244
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:55,480
our friend's house like what is going on

245
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:57,370
you know it was we were so excited and

246
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:59,379
we didn't know why she was being so nice

247
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:02,079
but you know we took the opportunity and

248
00:10:59,379 --> 00:11:04,600
we stayed at Elena's house and then from

249
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,310
one day he became like two days - three

250
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,440
days - four days - five days

251
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:10,120
and we were so confused why we were

252
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:13,389
staying here staying there for so long

253
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:15,579
and come to find out our convenience

254
00:11:13,389 --> 00:11:17,860
store got burnt down I don't think it

255
00:11:15,579 --> 00:11:20,440
was someone like maliciously trying to

256
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:24,310
burn down our store I believe it was

257
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:27,130
something with a gas tank or wire or

258
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:29,410
something and it had burnt down and I

259
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:31,690
thought I was just so confused I didn't

260
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:34,000
really know why what happened and why my

261
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:35,319
parents weren't super vocal about it

262
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,149
with us but I feel like they always

263
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:38,769
treated us that way where it's like

264
00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:40,329
where the parents will handle it like

265
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:42,370
you don't really need to know so after

266
00:11:40,329 --> 00:11:43,959
that store they opened up a Fried

267
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:46,149
Chicken business and it was called

268
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:48,399
chicken box and it was actually like 10

269
00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:50,500
minutes away from the other store that

270
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:54,160
got burnt down they did that for a few

271
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:55,149
years then it didn't do us well so they

272
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,699
stopped doing that

273
00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:59,769
and finally they bought a gas station in

274
00:11:57,699 --> 00:12:02,500
downtown Petersburg and my parents

275
00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:06,940
bought the gas station when I was

276
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:09,399
probably in junior high and this is a

277
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:10,000
store that they actually owned until

278
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:13,510
this day

279
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,690
so this store is super busy and it was

280
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:22,180
such a great business move for them

281
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:24,399
however like I mentioned Petersburg was

282
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:26,440
pretty rough back then and now it is

283
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,380
better but there are certain parts of

284
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:31,240
Petersburg that will always be rough and

285
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:33,579
where my parents store is happens to be

286
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:36,730
one of the most dangerous parts of

287
00:12:33,579 --> 00:12:40,930
Pittsburgh it's just a lot of drug

288
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:42,880
dealing crime robbery all of that my

289
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:44,529
parents have seen it all and they've

290
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,630
gone through so much with owning all

291
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:48,610
these different businesses because it

292
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:50,860
hasn't been in a great area I feel like

293
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:54,220
my parents got so judgmental of the kids

294
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:56,170
I was hanging out with during my high

295
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:58,420
school middle school years because of

296
00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:00,939
what they saw at their store they

297
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:03,430
naturally associated like black people

298
00:13:00,939 --> 00:13:04,720
all my black friends with what they saw

299
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:06,970
at the store because they didn't know

300
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,769
any better the way that these people at

301
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:12,459
the store would treat my parents was

302
00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:14,949
white trash you know my parents both can

303
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:17,620
speak English but it is broken and my

304
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:18,519
dad is better than my mom but they can

305
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,080
they mean they can have a full-on

306
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:22,200
conversation

307
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:23,940
it's just you can tell that they have

308
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,680
accent or they they don't say certain

309
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,870
words and some of their sentences don't

310
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,270
completely make sense but it was really

311
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:32,790
tough seeing my parents my whole life

312
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:35,070
just moved from business to business and

313
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:39,690
the area that the business was in would

314
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:43,020
get worse and worse fast forward to 2010

315
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:46,050
I graduate high school I move out to LA

316
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:47,670
to go to fit him in downtown LA I saw I

317
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:50,790
remember starting college and it was my

318
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:53,250
first week at fit him and I was super

319
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:56,460
excited to just kind of have my freedom

320
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:58,110
for my parents but also just to start

321
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:00,690
this new chapter in my life and I

322
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:04,560
remember clearly the first week that I

323
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:06,180
started fitting I was in class and I was

324
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,280
getting a lot of missed calls from my

325
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,390
friends back in Virginia and I was so

326
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,850
confused because I didn't know why

327
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:15,390
they'd be calling me blowing me up so

328
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:16,950
right when class finished I first talked

329
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:19,230
to my mom and just like telling her how

330
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:21,780
school was she sounded normal and

331
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:23,850
everything was good and we hang up and

332
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:26,370
then after that I checked my voicemail

333
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:29,640
because my friend left me a voicemail

334
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:32,220
and when I heard it she was pretty much

335
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:35,040
sounding so concerned and it went

336
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:36,780
something like hey Sophia like I saw the

337
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,320
news I just wanted to make sure you're

338
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:43,650
okay and you know I heard about your dad

339
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:46,710
and this is that and so I'm over here so

340
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:49,230
confused like what is she talking about

341
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:50,430
and so I called her back and I'm just

342
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:53,190
like I have no idea what you're talking

343
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:56,400
about and then she goes you know I saw

344
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:58,200
that your dad his store got robbed and I

345
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:02,100
heard that he got hurt and all this

346
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:04,080
stuff and I like I mentioned I had just

347
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,060
got off the phone with my mom and she

348
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,650
was completely normal so I told her like

349
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:09,540
oh no girl like I just got off the phone

350
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:11,190
with my mom like everything is fine like

351
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,630
she didn't mention anything I think you

352
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:15,030
got the wrong store but you know thank

353
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:16,890
you so much for being concerned and

354
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:18,930
reaching out to me and I thought it was

355
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:21,090
really weird but I didn't think about

356
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:22,860
calling my mom back and asking her

357
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:24,870
because that's my mom like if something

358
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:26,820
happened to my dad she'll call me right

359
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:29,010
then it's the next day and I believe

360
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:31,139
it's like a Saturday and me and my

361
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:33,410
sister are sleeping in and

362
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:36,749
then my sister gets a phone call from

363
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:38,519
Elena's sister and her name is Brittany

364
00:15:36,749 --> 00:15:39,959
and she's like we've pretty much called

365
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:41,730
her our cousin she's like our older

366
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:43,199
sister and we grew up with her because

367
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:45,899
we were always with Elena

368
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:48,569
and so she calls Robyn and we were

369
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:49,679
living in a loft at that time so even

370
00:15:48,569 --> 00:15:52,410
though we were in separate rooms the

371
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:55,859
ceiling was open so I can hear my sister

372
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:58,799
all I heard was hello and she just

373
00:15:55,859 --> 00:16:03,769
jumped up it was like screaming like

374
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:06,179
crying and at that moment I knew that

375
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:13,139
what my friend told me the day before

376
00:16:06,179 --> 00:16:14,910
was true and I was so confused on how my

377
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:19,439
mom could have sounded like everything

378
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:21,269
was okay so then I before my sister

379
00:16:19,439 --> 00:16:23,369
couldn't even get off the phone I called

380
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:25,379
my mom I remember calling her and I was

381
00:16:23,369 --> 00:16:27,350
so upset and I asked her the thing is

382
00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:31,259
like she tried to answer the phone and

383
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:33,419
sound like everything was okay still so

384
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:36,869
I call her and she's like hello and I'm

385
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:39,540
like in Korean mom are you lying to me

386
00:16:36,869 --> 00:16:43,079
like did something happen to dad

387
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:45,720
she literally breaks down and she tells

388
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:48,480
me the truth and she told me that our

389
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,819
store got robbed and my dad got shot in

390
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,769
the stomach and he's at the hospital but

391
00:16:50,819 --> 00:16:57,119
he's okay I started asking all these

392
00:16:52,769 --> 00:16:59,939
questions and my mom told me that the

393
00:16:57,119 --> 00:17:01,860
robber asked for all the money and my

394
00:16:59,939 --> 00:17:03,809
dad gave him everything and he still

395
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:06,360
decided to shoot my dad and leave I

396
00:17:03,809 --> 00:17:09,120
remember just screaming at my mom and

397
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:11,579
yelling like don't ever lie to me about

398
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:15,750
this like and I was like cursing at

399
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:17,730
her I was so upset oh I just wanted to

400
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:20,339
know why like how could you not tell us

401
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:22,049
and act like everything is okay like I

402
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:25,740
called you and you acted like everything

403
00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:28,860
was okay when my dad was not okay and he

404
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:32,610
was in the hospital and her answer is

405
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:35,010
what her answer always is for me and my

406
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:37,860
sister is life it's so frustrating and

407
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:39,539
it's because I didn't want to tell you

408
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,019
in Robin because I didn't want to worry

409
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:42,120
you

410
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:43,260
like I didn't want to worry you she

411
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,540
literally gave me the exam

412
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:47,490
like she was in her own head thinking

413
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:49,590
like what if I tell them and they're

414
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:51,570
driving and they get into a shock and

415
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:54,960
dig in a car accident like she worries

416
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:57,540
so much and she always is me Robin's

417
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,320
emotions come first and she just wants

418
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:01,350
us to be okay

419
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:03,150
but that doesn't make it okay and I get

420
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:05,070
what she's trying to do but it doesn't

421
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:08,040
make it right and I think I thought age

422
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:13,200
I was 18 I just left my home and moved

423
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:18,350
out to LA I think I deserve to know and

424
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:24,330
no matter what age you are um I remember

425
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:28,799
being in such disbelief that like my dad

426
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:32,030
my dad was robbed and got shot and

427
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:34,650
almost died that is something that I

428
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:37,530
never thought in a million years would

429
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:39,450
happen even though you know they had a

430
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:41,970
business that was pretty much in the

431
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:45,650
hood but it never crossed my mind that I

432
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:48,059
would experience that and it was

433
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:51,450
probably one of the hardest things I've

434
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:54,150
ever had to go through because like my

435
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:58,400
parents insisted that I didn't go home

436
00:18:54,150 --> 00:19:02,880
and because I had just started finem and

437
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:06,299
Finan wasn't cheap and my parents paid

438
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:09,360
for my entire tuition in two years they

439
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:12,870
paid it off and they have worked their

440
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:16,919
entire life for me and my sister to be

441
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:19,320
okay and for us to pursue our dreams and

442
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:21,179
that is why they sacrifice their lives

443
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,309
every single day until this day they

444
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:27,330
have that store I remember talking to my

445
00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:30,990
dad for the first time since he was in

446
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:33,290
the hospital and I just I just broke

447
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:38,640
down and like me and my dad we're not

448
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:43,559
super emotional with each other but the

449
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:45,960
feeling of almost losing him is I I was

450
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:49,679
torn to think that if that ever happened

451
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:53,970
again I I don't know what I would do

452
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:56,519
because my parents mean so much to me

453
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:58,019
and they have given

454
00:19:56,519 --> 00:20:01,109
me they have sacrificed everything for

455
00:19:58,019 --> 00:20:02,549
me my sister literally everything to

456
00:20:01,109 --> 00:20:05,099
think that they still have that gas

457
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:06,509
station today the one that my dad was

458
00:20:05,099 --> 00:20:10,589
shot at he's still working there right

459
00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:13,950
now but because my parents were in that

460
00:20:10,589 --> 00:20:18,389
kind of environment all the time working

461
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:20,279
and having a lot of the customers say

462
00:20:18,389 --> 00:20:22,169
racist things to them yell at them

463
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:25,559
because they can't understand them just

464
00:20:22,169 --> 00:20:27,629
talk so much to them and my parents

465
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:29,099
can see what goes on like literally

466
00:20:27,629 --> 00:20:31,469
right in front of my store there are

467
00:20:29,099 --> 00:20:34,679
drug transactions happening every single

468
00:20:31,469 --> 00:20:37,950
day I mean I went with Silas to Virginia

469
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:39,749
this past December and I showed him my

470
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:42,659
store for the first time and he was just

471
00:20:39,749 --> 00:20:44,339
like okay so you're just gonna sell

472
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:46,769
drugs right there and I'm like yep it's

473
00:20:44,339 --> 00:20:49,889
just part of it this I'm so used to it

474
00:20:46,769 --> 00:20:51,059
doesn't even faze me anymore it's it's

475
00:20:49,889 --> 00:20:52,859
something where you can't even really

476
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:54,659
get the police involved because even

477
00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:57,690
with them being involved they can't

478
00:20:54,659 --> 00:21:01,579
change what's going on sorry

479
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:04,649
so I feel like my parents had this bad

480
00:21:01,579 --> 00:21:05,549
connotation about black people and I

481
00:21:04,649 --> 00:21:09,149
feel like they didn't know any better

482
00:21:05,549 --> 00:21:13,070
but they just hated the fact that I only

483
00:21:09,149 --> 00:21:15,239
had black friends and I didn't have a

484
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:17,789
diverse group of friends where it was

485
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:19,529
like black white or Asian and I tried to

486
00:21:17,789 --> 00:21:21,299
explain my parents like I just connect

487
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:23,459
with who I connect with I do have white

488
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:25,259
friends I do like at school I have white

489
00:21:23,459 --> 00:21:28,409
friends but I you may just see me around

490
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:30,329
more with my black friends and like with

491
00:21:28,409 --> 00:21:31,559
the Asians kids it's like I was so

492
00:21:30,329 --> 00:21:33,479
frustrated with them so I remember

493
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:35,279
arguing with them telling them if you

494
00:21:33,479 --> 00:21:37,409
wanted me to have Asian friends then why

495
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:39,269
don't you have me in Korea why did you

496
00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:40,769
come to America and then now you're

497
00:21:39,269 --> 00:21:42,629
trying to dictate who I can be friends

498
00:21:40,769 --> 00:21:44,489
with you know how hard it is like

499
00:21:42,629 --> 00:21:45,899
already feeling like a minority and

500
00:21:44,489 --> 00:21:47,549
feeling different and then now you're

501
00:21:45,899 --> 00:21:49,379
telling me that you don't have approve

502
00:21:47,549 --> 00:21:52,499
of my friends because of this and that

503
00:21:49,379 --> 00:21:54,709
it was that conversation always happened

504
00:21:52,499 --> 00:21:59,369
in my household I tried to understand

505
00:21:54,709 --> 00:22:00,839
why they felt the way they did I'm not

506
00:21:59,369 --> 00:22:03,269
saying that it was right and I'm not

507
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:05,820
saying my parents are racist I have all

508
00:22:03,269 --> 00:22:08,360
sorts of different types of friends and

509
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:10,039
they are cool with it and they

510
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,870
they're so sweet to them when they come

511
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:14,090
over but when they think about me

512
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:16,610
overall they just they were concerned

513
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:18,980
about my future and like how I was gonna

514
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:21,679
end up because of the friends eyes I

515
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:24,429
kind of vibe with and to be honest my

516
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:28,399
choice of friends until like junior high

517
00:22:24,429 --> 00:22:30,289
was pretty poor I mean I was just a

518
00:22:28,399 --> 00:22:33,500
rebellious kid there's so much that my

519
00:22:30,289 --> 00:22:35,029
parents didn't understand and there was

520
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:37,039
so much that I didn't understand about

521
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:39,230
my parents I wouldn't say that I had a

522
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:42,769
great childhood going through all of

523
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:43,519
this because it was I I didn't know who

524
00:22:42,769 --> 00:22:45,740
I was

525
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:48,309
sorry I feel like I'm just all over the

526
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:53,059
board here and getting kind of off topic

527
00:22:48,309 --> 00:22:54,980
but I want to kind of refocus and get

528
00:22:53,059 --> 00:22:59,330
back to the questions to answer this

529
00:22:54,980 --> 00:23:03,289
question no I was never proud of my

530
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:06,799
heritage and my culture and I truly

531
00:23:03,289 --> 00:23:08,779
hated the fact that I was Korean I

532
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:11,179
didn't have like the relationship I

533
00:23:08,779 --> 00:23:13,460
wanted to have with my parents which I

534
00:23:11,179 --> 00:23:15,080
saw you know a lot of my close friends

535
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:17,720
had such great relationships with their

536
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:22,130
parents it just wasn't the case for me I

537
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:24,019
remember I had my first boyfriend who I

538
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:26,600
thought at the time I fell in love with

539
00:23:24,019 --> 00:23:29,480
and I remember he went to Target and he

540
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:34,250
stole some makeup for me and we were

541
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:37,100
together and he got caught we both had

542
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:42,580
to go to court and my parents found out

543
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:45,169
and when I tell you that I got beat I

544
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:48,049
agen parents don't play and I think that

545
00:23:45,169 --> 00:23:51,320
that's another thing like nowadays I'm

546
00:23:48,049 --> 00:23:56,779
so glad that that's happening less

547
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:59,960
because it's not like I'm trying to to

548
00:23:56,779 --> 00:24:02,750
beat you because I just want to beat you

549
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:07,010
it's really like a discipline thing but

550
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:09,049
I feel like a lot of Asian parents back

551
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:11,450
in the day they went a little overboard

552
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:14,000
and I'm not gonna lie my parents were a

553
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:18,050
little overboard with my beatings

554
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:22,700
and experienced a lot of them but I in

555
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:24,950
hindsight i I get what they were trying

556
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:27,920
to do I just don't think that that is

557
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:29,350
the best way to execute that but yeah I

558
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:32,270
got into a lot of trouble had to go to

559
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:35,650
court and when mom had to see my

560
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:41,570
boyfriend who she did not approve of and

561
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:43,940
there was just so much lying in my high

562
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:46,520
school years I really got into so much

563
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:49,880
trouble and my parents thought they were

564
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:51,740
so concerned about my future I remember

565
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:54,530
coming home one day and my mom is just

566
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:56,390
at the kitchen counter crying she was

567
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:58,360
saying things like I wish I never came

568
00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:02,060
to America and had you and I wish that

569
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:05,690
you were born in Korea and she was just

570
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:07,370
so worried about my life and I was so

571
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:09,290
worried that my parents were never going

572
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:11,960
to change they were always going to be

573
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:14,870
this judgmental about my friends and who

574
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:20,540
I date and all this stuff but it wasn't

575
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:22,820
until I moved to LA and I just obviously

576
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:26,630
had that distance from them I mean I

577
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:31,010
moved across the country and I was able

578
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:33,140
to just to live freely but I was put in

579
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:35,150
that position in the first place because

580
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:36,590
my parents supported me and they

581
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:38,540
supported what I was going to go to

582
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:41,390
school for even though they were very

583
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:43,430
traditional they didn't expect me to be

584
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:45,380
a lawyer or a doctor they let my sister

585
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:47,800
pursue fashion and they let me pursue

586
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:51,140
beauty and that is something that I was

587
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:52,880
so grateful for because everything else

588
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:54,680
my parents was very traditional but when

589
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,540
it came to this as far as like me my

590
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:59,480
sister's career they were so supportive

591
00:25:56,540 --> 00:26:02,360
and that was really a blessing and

592
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:04,700
that's the reason why I am even in LA to

593
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:06,800
begin with they paid for me and my

594
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:09,710
sister's tuition like they paid it off

595
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:14,150
two years they worked their asses off to

596
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:16,490
do everything for my sister and I that's

597
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:19,250
pretty much their life to make sure that

598
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:23,030
we're okay and that we we pursue our

599
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:26,120
dreams while their reality is going to

600
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:27,120
the gas station every day that's

601
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,250
dangerous

602
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,950
and not something that they want to do

603
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:35,550
but they sacrifice for my sister and I

604
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:40,290
so I feel like with that move I finally

605
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:43,650
came to LA and I'm like whoa there's a

606
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:45,240
lot of Asian people here and I was so

607
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:47,700
taken back because I've never been

608
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:50,040
around so many Asians and then I went to

609
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:54,780
k-town and I'm like oh my gosh like this

610
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:57,810
is crazy and I think from then I slowly

611
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:59,580
and gradually started to really feel

612
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:01,860
comfortable with who I am and want to

613
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:05,040
get to know my culture and and that is

614
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:07,620
where it all began and from then I I

615
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:10,650
started dating I dated my first Asian

616
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:12,450
guy and it's not that I was specifically

617
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:14,460
trying to date someone Asian it just

618
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:16,470
happened and even till this day I

619
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:18,960
wouldn't say that I only date agent guys

620
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:21,660
I would date anyone I've dated everyone

621
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,700
and I'm very open-minded about that but

622
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:26,760
I think that it was a real cool

623
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:31,950
experience to date my first Asian guy

624
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:34,710
who is Vietnamese and to learn about his

625
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:38,880
culture and then share stuff about my

626
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:40,320
culture it moving to LA had really was a

627
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,360
game changer for me

628
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,090
because I did not have that in Virginia

629
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:47,070
and where I'm from it was you just

630
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:49,410
there's none of that there there's no

631
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:52,350
culture there I think that moving to LA

632
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:57,150
was the best decision of my life yes I

633
00:27:52,350 --> 00:28:01,020
can speak Korean but it's like third

634
00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:03,930
grade level I'm really bad at it

635
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:06,270
but I can get by if I need to I did go

636
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:08,850
to Korean school every summer my mom

637
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:11,670
would send me Robin off to Korea I would

638
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:13,320
have to go to Korean school and learn

639
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:15,510
Korean but I don't know where all that

640
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:18,060
information is because I didn't retain

641
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:20,190
any of it my sister used to be really

642
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:22,200
good and fluent in Korean but then she

643
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:24,980
forgot most of it as well but her Korean

644
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:27,720
is definitely better than mine it sounds

645
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:32,580
decent and good and whereas mine is just

646
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:35,780
like like a little kid so yeah I am so

647
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:38,850
 proud to be korean-american I

648
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:41,040
wouldn't want to be anything else in

649
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,309
this world I love the fact that I can

650
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:44,220
say

651
00:28:41,309 --> 00:28:46,139
I'm Korean and I was born in America and

652
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:48,389
I'm korean-american that is what I

653
00:28:46,139 --> 00:28:50,190
identify with I love the fact that I can

654
00:28:48,389 --> 00:28:53,039
be both I don't need to choose because

655
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:55,139
they are both Who I am I feel like all

656
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:58,529
that embarrassment I went through my

657
00:28:55,139 --> 00:29:02,610
childhood years just feeling so shitty

658
00:28:58,529 --> 00:29:05,460
about being Korean I was able to really

659
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:07,559
overcome that and fill in those those

660
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:09,840
really sad moments in my life by

661
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:12,240
embracing it so much more now you guys

662
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,070

making it for my friends I love you know

668
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:32,369
putting it on my channel and I remember

669
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:34,649
reading some comments on the Korean

670
00:29:32,369 --> 00:29:36,539
students that I would make and this girl

671
00:29:34,649 --> 00:29:38,490
was just saying like I really love how

672
00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:40,440
you embrace Korean food like it was

673
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:41,190
always really hard for me and I was kind

674
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,159
of embarrassed

675
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:46,619
to embrace it and I didn't want my

676
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:49,529
friends to be around when I had it but

677
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:52,619
watching your videos really inspires me

678
00:29:49,529 --> 00:29:54,779
to just love it and be more proud about

679
00:29:52,619 --> 00:29:56,730
it and I'm like hell yeah that's how I

680
00:29:54,779 --> 00:29:58,740
felt back in the day and you do feel

681
00:29:56,730 --> 00:30:00,419
embarrassed and you feel like oh this is

682
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:02,669
different but why wouldn't you want to

683
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:03,749
be different and on top of that if it

684
00:30:02,669 --> 00:30:05,879
tastes good to you

685
00:30:03,749 --> 00:30:08,220
 what everyone else thinks like if

686
00:30:05,879 --> 00:30:10,559
it's su-sure tastebuds you better eat it

687
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:13,440
and love it it makes me so happy to know

688
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:16,200
that there are other Asian American kids

689
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,450
who watch my videos and at first they

690
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,519
felt the same way that I did growing up

691
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:22,889
but once they see me and other creators

692
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:25,889
who are Asian American embracing that

693
00:30:22,889 --> 00:30:28,049
and being proud of your culture and the

694
00:30:25,889 --> 00:30:30,480
food that you eat giving them the

695
00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:32,909
strength to do that as well it's really

696
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,669
empowering and I can't explain how much

697
00:30:32,909 --> 00:30:38,279
warmth that makes me feel I feel so

698
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:41,789
incredibly blessed to kind of have this

699
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:44,220
platform and encourage other Asian

700
00:30:41,789 --> 00:30:47,039
American kids who are minorities at your

701
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:49,379
school and who have felt like you're

702
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:52,440
different and alone I truly want to

703
00:30:49,379 --> 00:30:53,430
speak to you and and tell you that you

704
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,650
aren't alone

705
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:58,020
and I've been through it all - but at

706
00:30:55,650 --> 00:31:03,030
the end of it all I could not be more

707
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:04,920
proud to be a Korean American and it's I

708
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:07,410
wouldn't have it any other way

709
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:10,500
I want anyone who feels like a minority

710
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:14,700
or just different I want you to know

711
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:16,500
that being different is beautiful there

712
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:18,750
isn't supposed to be anyone like

713
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:21,060
yourself I love the fact that I have a

714
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:23,400
variety of different friends who are all

715
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:28,050
different races I highly recommend for

716
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:30,480
everyone to be open-minded and want to

717
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:33,090
meet new people different people people

718
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,760
who have a different ethnic background

719
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:37,170
than you the more knowledge that you

720
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,750
know about all of these different

721
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:42,480
cultures I feel like you're only gaining

722
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:45,060
from that it's all positive who wouldn't

723
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:49,080
want to know 20 different cultures and

724
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:52,830
try 20 different types of food then just

725
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:56,160
knowing one thing and that's it I aspire

726
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:58,860
to travel the world and get to know so

727
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:02,130
many more cultures than I do now and

728
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:05,160
live in in in their shoes and get to

729
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:08,550
know their beliefs and their values I

730
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:11,160
think that that is what makes this world

731
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:13,530
so great nothing is special about being

732
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:15,630
a 1-dimensional you want to be like the

733
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:17,460
rainbow you want to see different colors

734
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:20,310
being different is what makes you you

735
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:21,900
and no one can take that away from you

736
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:23,250
as long as you embrace it and you're

737
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:26,010
confident about it

738
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:28,740
everyone else isn't a thing you got it

739
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:31,500
going on and if they don't who the

740
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:33,180
cares it clearly tells you that that is

741
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:37,020
someone you don't need in your life and

742
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:39,210
they're just one opinion of many in the

743
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:41,940
world if they disagree with you on

744
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:44,850
things and so be it let them say their

745
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:46,920
piece and move on and that is the

746
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:49,710
biggest advice I can give to you guys or

747
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:51,240
anyone else who is going through

748
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:53,280
something similar that I went through

749
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:55,440
you get so caught up about being this

750
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:57,120
person that people want you to be if

751
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,100
your mind is wrapped around on that

752
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:01,470
you're not really living you're just

753
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:03,870
living because people tell you what to

754
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:06,120
do you have one life to live why not

755
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:07,260
live it with your own opinions your own

756
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:10,830
thoughts and

757
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:12,570
no one else's that's for me is is the

758
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:14,280
best life that you can live and for the

759
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:18,300
last question my favorite thing about

760
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:19,860
being asian-american is that I get the

761
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:22,590
best of both worlds

762
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:26,880
I love being Korean just as much as I

763
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:29,310
love being American I love American food

764
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,440
I love Korean food I love Korean people

765
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:33,810
I love American people I love it all and

766
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,690
the fact that I can be both

767
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:39,900
and not just one I feel like that's kind

768
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:43,140
of cool before I close this video I just

769
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:48,990
wanted to take the time to thank my

770
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:54,120
parents for raising two strong beautiful

771
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:56,340
independent girls and I just want them

772
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:59,670
to know that I love them so much and I

773
00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:02,250
would do anything for them and the

774
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:06,450
reason why that I work as hard as I do

775
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:10,310
is to one day retire them and to let

776
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:15,690
them finally be able to live a free life

777
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:19,350
their entire life they have been working

778
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:22,590
working working working and working in

779
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:26,370
very dangerous environments with very

780
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:29,879
long hours and they've pretty much I've

781
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:33,450
done that since I was a baby and even

782
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:36,270
till this day it still continues by

783
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:38,040
their own choice however still for my

784
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:40,669
sister and I they're always about

785
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:43,350
feeling comfortable and stable and

786
00:34:40,669 --> 00:34:45,780
looking towards the future I just want

787
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:48,320
to thank them so much and let them know

788
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:53,460
that I am beyond grateful and

789
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:56,520
appreciative and I just love them Wow

790
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:59,580

791
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:02,790
