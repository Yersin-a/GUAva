00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:05,520
channel today I'll be filming a Q&A

3
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,620
it's been a while since I filmed one of

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,599
these and I received a lot of questions

5
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,179
on Instagram so I'm gonna try my best to

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,980
answer as many as I can today so let's

7
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:17,760
get started when are you coming to LA

00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,170
I'm actually in LA right now and Abe is

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,910

10
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,449

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:27,599
it's Abe what's on your 2019 bucket list

13
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,490
I don't make these lists anymore made me

14
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,460
because I don't want to get disappointed

15
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:35,309
when I don't fulfill them but one of the

16
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,260
things I wanted to do this year was to

17
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:39,480
visit a country that I haven't been to

18
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,809
and I already did that I went to Spain

19
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:45,149
and then I'm gonna go to Philippines and

20
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:48,059
I don't know I want to travel as much as

21
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:49,559
I can before I settle down

22
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:52,770

23
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:55,079
settle down I don't know when are you

24
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:58,710

California and that transition is

32
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,659

don't plan on getting married anytime

110
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:37,420
soon

111
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,240
but if the right person comes into my

112
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:41,920
life then maybe I'll get married what is

113
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,050
the best thing that happened to you

114
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,490
during the past week since I'm in LA

115
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,470
I've been meeting up with a lot of my

116
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,240
friends and catching up with them so I

117
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:52,540
guess that has been the biggest

118
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:54,490
highlight and it just got to LA so he

119
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:57,010
doesn't want to be in the video cuz he

120
00:04:54,490 --> 00:05:02,050
looks like he just got off the plane

121
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:07,510
no seriously is not a good site not that

122
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:11,020

because he's a nerd but he's also very

129
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,729
powerful and when it comes to

130
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:28,570
