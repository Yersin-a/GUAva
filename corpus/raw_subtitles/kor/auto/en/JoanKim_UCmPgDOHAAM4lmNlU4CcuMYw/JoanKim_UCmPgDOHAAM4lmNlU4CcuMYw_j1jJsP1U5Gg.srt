00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:06,899
hi everyone welcome back to my channel

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,610
and in today's video I will be sharing

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:10,679
with you guys something that I have been

5
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:13,799
wanting to share on my channel and it's

6
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:16,350
about my life as a Korean American so

7
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:18,390
Amy actually tagged me to do the Asian

8
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,010
American tack but I wanted to do it a

9
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,500
little differently by sharing with you

10
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:25,260
guys my background story first before

11
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,170
getting into those details so I'm gonna

12
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,210
start my story now so if you didn't know

13
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,940
I was born and raised in Los Angeles

14
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:36,059
California and when I was about three

15
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:38,430
and when my brother was born our family

16
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:41,370
we moved to South Korea because my

17
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,649
grandpa was diagnosed with cancer and my

18
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,829
parents wanted us to spend time with him

19
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:50,039
and I remember going to preschool you

20
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:51,600
chew on in Korea and you know I just

21
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,899
grew up like learning how to speak

22
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,809
Korean and that's all I knew but then

23
00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:01,289
when I was five I moved back and then I

24
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:05,700
started attending school and I was the

25
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:08,340
only Asian in my school so obviously I

26
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:12,000
looked very different and I didn't know

27
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:14,729
the language so I mean as a kid I'm kind

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,130
of like very similar to what I am now

29
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:18,960
I'm very extroverted and I love meeting

30
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,180
new people so I didn't really have a

31
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,920
problem with making friends but of

32
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,049
course there was that language barrier

33
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,090
but I don't really remember like

34
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:30,420
traumatic experiences like from

35
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:32,670
kindergarten at all so in first grade

36
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,710
that's when I kind of realized that I

37
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:38,759
was different because during reading

38
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:40,920
time I was always asked to you know come

39
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:44,070
out of the room and then go to another

40
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,290
classroom and do ESL courses with

41
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:48,780
another teacher and you know that was

42
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,610
very helpful for me but I also hated it

43
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,530
because I felt very different from my

44
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:56,909
classmates and they would always be like

45
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:59,540
oh thank you - you - so that actually

46
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:02,189
motivated me to study harder and

47
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:05,130
actually I'll be going into details of

48
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:06,750
this later but every time people pointed

49
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,300
out that I was different or like a

50
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,840
certain stereotype I would always work

51
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,390
extra hearts just so that I would know

52
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,790
Irby and ESL and that I could get better

53
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:19,610
grades and things like that so yeah in

54
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:21,379
first grade I had to deal with feeling

55
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,510
different because I would always have to

56
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:26,660
step out of the classroom for those ESL

57
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:29,299
courses and then I also remember a time

58
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:32,420
when my like classmates they were

59
00:02:29,299 --> 00:02:34,790
looking through a magazine and it was a

60
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:36,709
Britney Spears magazine and I remember

61
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:38,090
not knowing who she was and my

62
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:41,239
classmates made fun of me for not

63
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:44,450
knowing who she was and like I grew up

64
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:47,180
liking kpop so I'm a very

65
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:49,840
oh gee kpop fan like i listened to it

66
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:54,819
back when pink girl is around baby books

67
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:58,400
geode ebola kannada like dolls were like

68
00:02:54,819 --> 00:03:00,530
those are my idols so for them to hate

69
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,019
on me for not knowing who Britney Spears

70
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:05,209
was like that was really sad on my end

71
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:08,440
but I remember like going to like

72
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:11,000
Ralph's and Albertsons just to study the

73
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:13,010
celebrities because I had no idea who

74
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,680
any of them were so 2nd grade comes

75
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:17,660
around and a Korean moved to our

76
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,880
district and I was like whoa that's

77
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:21,380
really cool and I remember teachers

78
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,750
asking me to come out of the classroom

79
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:26,299
just to help her because I knew how to

80
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:28,760
speak both English and Korean now so I

81
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:31,160
felt really good about doing that

82
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,650
because for the first time I felt a

83
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:36,440
sense of worth because now people were

84
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:39,019
praising me for knowing Korean and

85
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:41,329
Korean culture so I remember for like a

86
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:43,190
whole year the teachers would always let

87
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:45,470
me sit with this girl and I would always

88
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:48,079
translate for her help her do her work

89
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:51,410
and things like that but then like later

90
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:55,010
um I realized that she didn't want to do

91
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:57,620
anything Korean than you were so I kind

92
00:03:55,010 --> 00:04:00,019
of felt how do I explain this

93
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:01,639
so I remember this girl kind of avoiding

94
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:03,620
me because she just didn't want to

95
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:06,319
practice Korean anymore and I remember

96
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:08,090
coming back home and I told my brother I

97
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:11,480
was like Abe from now on we're gonna

98
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:13,220
only speak English at home and we

99
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,859
started doing that to our parents as

100
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:18,260
well and I remember my mom feeling so

101
00:04:15,859 --> 00:04:21,079
sad afterwards because if you think

102
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:23,750
about it now well if I think about it

103
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:25,490
now my parents Bulls sacrifice their

104
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:27,710
comfortable life in Korea

105
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:31,819
do move to America for me and my brother

106
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:34,759
and even after we moved we still came

107
00:04:31,819 --> 00:04:37,099
back after two years of living in Korea

108
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:40,190
because my parents wanted us to have an

109
00:04:37,099 --> 00:04:41,930
education in America so I felt terrible

110
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:44,389
about that and I also got in trouble for

111
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:46,130
trying to only speak English at home and

112
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:48,889
then after that I was like you know I'm

113
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:50,990
just gonna embrace Korean and at home it

114
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:53,930
will just be Korean and outside of it I

115
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:56,389
will just speak English so I always kept

116
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:58,550
it like I never shared this information

117
00:04:56,389 --> 00:04:59,750
with my friends at school just because I

118
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:02,389
don't know I was always embarrassed

119
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,919
about being Korean so there's a little

120
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:05,090
bit of my foundation now I'm going to

121
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,110
answer some questions from the

122
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:11,010
asian-american tag

123
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:13,350
I'm korean-american my parents were both

124
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:16,110
born in Seoul South Korea and then they

125
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:18,750
moved to America and then I was born so

126
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:21,150
I guess I would be 1.5 generation or

127
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:22,590
second generation my uncle always tells

128
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:25,889
me of second generation but I always

129
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:27,840
feel like I am 1.5

130
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:30,749
I kind of shared this in my background

131
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,069
story but definitely when my classmates

132
00:05:30,749 --> 00:05:33,659
were flipping through the magazine and

133
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:34,919
talking about Britney Spears I knew

134
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:37,169
there was something different about that

135
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:38,999
and also none of my classmates looked

136
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:41,789
like me we had different eyes we had

137
00:05:38,999 --> 00:05:44,180
different hair colors and yeah I knew

138
00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:47,069
for a fact that I was different but also

139
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:49,319
when we all started to learn about Asian

140
00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:50,879
culture in history class I remember

141
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:52,259
people were like Oh what kind of Asian

142
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:54,150
were you again were you Chinese or

143
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:58,770
Japanese and when I would answer I'm

144
00:05:54,150 --> 00:06:01,110
Korean no one knew what Korea was and I

145
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:03,389
was like oh that's so strange like I'm

146
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:06,180
Korean and I know the language and the

147
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:07,770
music and everything but I felt kind of

148
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,719
different there and then when we learned

149
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:12,330
about Korea people would ask me are you

150
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:14,639
north or south and actually I went back

151
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,740
home and asked my mom like am i north or

152
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,139
in my south korean and my mom answered

153
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:21,120
that I am South Korean because both my

154
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:24,389
parents were born in Seoul South Korea

155
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,699
but later I also learned that my grandpa

156
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:29,279
like one of my grandparents he is from

157
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:33,719
North Korea and then I got to learn more

158
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:36,110
about his story and his testimony things

159
00:06:33,719 --> 00:06:36,110
like that

160
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:42,130
even as a child I was always very proud

161
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:44,889
to be Korean and I remember trying to

162
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:47,050
share with my classmates who bola was

163
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:49,479
but of course I did mention in my

164
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:52,419
background story where I did want to try

165
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:54,910
to reject it but I respected my parents

166
00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:57,950
too much to reject my Korean heritage so

167
00:06:54,910 --> 00:07:00,020
I was very proud about it

168
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:03,410
this definitely changed throughout the

169
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:06,410
years so in elementary junior high and

170
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:09,140
high school the stereotype was Asians

171
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:11,090
are smart so I knew for a fact that I

172
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:13,010
wasn't born with the brains my brother

173
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:16,160
is actually really really intelligent

174
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:18,500
and I just kind of like got the grades

175
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,480
that I needed and it just went like

176
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,550
above and beyond but I definitely knew I

177
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,560
wasn't like smart compared to my brother

178
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:26,330
but because all of my classmates kept

179
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,210
telling me that Asians are smart

180
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:32,060
I would work extra hard like I mentioned

181
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:34,130
before I was the first child in my

182
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:36,290
family like I was the first born my

183
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:37,790
parents were both from Korea they went

184
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:39,890
to college in Korea and they didn't

185
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:42,350
really like they weren't too strict with

186
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:44,030
me but I feel like they became strict

187
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:46,700
with my brother because I would be like

188
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:48,650
no mom dad Abe has to do this this and

189
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,750
that so my brother always jokes around

190
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:52,520
saying that I am his second mother but

191
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,410
yeah one of the stereotypes that I did

192
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:57,110
struggle with was like Asians are smart

193
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:59,270
but that actually motivated me to take

194
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:01,400
the classes that I took and get the

195
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:03,590
grades that I got when I went to college

196
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:06,860
at UC Berkeley that's when I met the

197
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:08,570
most Asians so like I mentioned before I

198
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:10,520
went to a school where I was the only

199
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:13,130
Asian in the beginning and then I think

200
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:16,580
I can count like how many Asians

201
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:18,440
attended my school with my hands like in

202
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:20,930
elementary school and then it like

203
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:24,710
obviously grew the Asian community grew

204
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:27,560
in our neighborhood but in college I

205
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:31,430
never met so many Korean Americans

206
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:33,860
Koreans like Asians overall and I didn't

207
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:35,030
really feel a stereotype because we were

208
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:38,090
all the same

209
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:39,890
but then when I moved to Korea there was

210
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:43,070
another stereotype that I had to deal

211
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:45,670
with which is being korean-american how

212
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:48,650
do I explain this kind of situation

213
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:50,270
people would kind of assume that I had a

214
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:53,210
lot of money for speaking English but

215
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:55,070
that was definitely not the case and

216
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:57,380
then some people would just kind of

217
00:08:55,070 --> 00:09:00,500
point out that like oh I'm being very

218
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:02,570
ignorant even though I knew Korean so

219
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,490
like I remember like my friend and I we

220
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:05,930
were eating at this restaurant and like

221
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:07,610
the ladies right next to us we were like

222
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:09,860
oh my gosh she's so Curry

223
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,680
she looks Korean but she's not speaking

224
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,839
any Korean

225
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:15,629
that's like a shameful thing but then

226
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:17,339
when I was paying for the food I would

227
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:17,910
speak in like Korean and they were like

228
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:20,009
whoa

229
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:22,889
so ho like I always felt like I had to

230
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:25,819
prove myself that like oh I really try

231
00:09:22,889 --> 00:09:30,629
my best to learn both of the cultures so

232
00:09:25,819 --> 00:09:32,819
yeah yes I can and I'm nowhere where I

233
00:09:30,629 --> 00:09:34,980
want to be because I didn't go to school

234
00:09:32,819 --> 00:09:37,429
here but I can read speak and write

235
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,429
Korean

236
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:46,230
growing up I learned how to be an adult

237
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:48,360
a lot quicker than most because my

238
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:51,000
parents needed help translating

239
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:54,270
documents and every time they needed to

240
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,780
call like I don't know like an electric

241
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:59,430
bill company or a gas company I had to

242
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:02,610
do it with them sitting right next to me

243
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:05,220
so I remember like in the beginning I

244
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:07,470
liked doing it but then I also got angry

245
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:10,260
every time I had to do this but you know

246
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:12,720
like that kind of got me closer to my

247
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:14,460
mom because you know she was dealing

248
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,790
with all the finances and things like

249
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:18,900
that so I think growing up

250
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:20,910
korean-american like my relationship

251
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:23,580
with my like parents it was always like

252
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:26,040
a close one

253
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:28,110
I am very proud of being korean-american

254
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,360
and I was always proud of being

255
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:33,690
korean-american I love the food I love

256
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:36,090
the music I love the films are like you

257
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:38,250
guys watch Joan Day and this is actually

258
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:43,580

259
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:43,580
Korea in a more realistic view

260
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:48,610
definitely enjoying best of both worlds

261
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:51,160
in America there are diners and in Korea

262
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:53,890
there are pajamas and I identify with

263
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:55,900
both both has to do with food actually

264
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:58,570
