19
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:43,050
could go either way good or bad because

20
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,910
you guys know I have a lot of to

21
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:48,510
say about this I am a first generation

22
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:51,030
Korean American my parents immigrated

23
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:53,250
here the 80s that being said my first

24
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,770
language was actually Korean everyone in

25
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,660
my household spoke Korean so on that was

26
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:01,680
my first language well I grew up in a

27
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:03,600
very Korean heavily populated city and I

28
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,030
was like only surrounded by Koreans like

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,299
I was born and where there's a lot of

30
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:11,159
Korean people I went to church in k-town

31
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:13,049
so I was there every single Sunday just

32
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,869
surrounded by Koreans Koreans all around

33
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:18,299
me I went to a Korean daycare /

34
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:20,610
preschool that was at a Korean Church

35
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:23,189
around where I lived so I was just

36
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,240
surrounded by Koreans all throughout my

37
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:27,000
entire childhood

38
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,030
so as I was growing up like all I really

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,890
knew even though I was born in America

40
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,049
I was only surrounded by Korean people a

41
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,329
lot of us just spoke Korean so I wasn't

42
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:40,229
really surrounded by many other like a

43
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:43,829
diverse range as a kid that all changed

44
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:46,140
when I entered preschool I had a enroll

45
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:48,479
in a you know public school so it was a

46
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,570
I wasn't the only Korean person there

47
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,759
there was like a lot of other different

48
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:55,680
races and I was like the first kind of

49
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,450
culture shock for me because I was just

50
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,060
surrounded by Korean people and I was

51
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,460
like when I realized I'm a minority like

52
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,200
so since I was like the only I was

53
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:07,170
extremely shy like I'm already a pretty

54
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,420
shy person as it is but since I was I

55
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,730
was like the only Asian person in the

56
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,770
class I was just like extremely shy

57
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,840
didn't talk at all ice

58
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,070
spoke English and I could I understand

59
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,380
what I understood what everyone was

60
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:21,570
saying to me but I just was like just

61
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,740
chose to be mute that's a kid like I did

62
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:24,960
I just didn't want to talk to anyone

63
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:26,670
because I was so extremely shy but

64
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,680
eventually like during preschool I

65
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:30,090
started hanging out with or I started

66
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,040
talking to other people like all his

67
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,960
friends so I had like a little group

68
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,640
when I was in preschool it was like me

69
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,650
this white girl that's Hispanic girl and

70
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,570
another Hispanic girl and I was like

71
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,160
only Asian one so we were like friends

72
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:43,080
but then that's when I moved to a

73
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,030
different city which didn't have a lot

74
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,560
of Korean people at the time I think now

75
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,730
it's like more Korean people but I

76
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,500
thought time it was like mostly white

77
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:51,900
people Hispanic people so I was like the

78
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,670
only Asian kid in the class this this is

79
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,250
like first grade this is when I first

80
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:58,530
experienced like racism and this is when

81
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:00,360
I started to lose my fluency in Korean

82
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,160
because like this this is when the

83
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,410
school started making me speaking

84
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:07,370
English more rather than Korean so yeah

85
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:10,410
my first hand it racist experience

86
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:13,140
wasn't first grade like as I said I was

87
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:14,820
sheltered my entire life not knowing a

88
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,860
lot of different races I didn't know

89
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,600
anything about like I didn't know much

90
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,459
about other races like I didn't know

91
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,100
anything about like the racist

92
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:23,430
terminology being made fun of for who I

93
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,590
am

94
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,780
or I didn't make fun of other people for

95
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:30,240
who they were so like the first thing

96
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,250
that people said to me was like Lily

97
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,650
Hong - that's my last name Lily Hong

98
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:37,590
Kong change Hong ding dong Ling long

99
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:39,360
Tintin King Kong ping pong like people

100
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,400
were just making fun of my last name and

101
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,350
I was like what's so funny about my last

102
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,030
name is like it just seemed normal

103
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:46,890
who's like I mean a lot of other Asian

104
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:49,350
people we have like really short last

105
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:51,360
names like that so for me I was like it

106
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:52,709
didn't really hurt me it just annoyed me

107
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,600
like I was like pretty Savage I was a

108
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:56,790
kid too like I was just like the

109
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,770
like it's not funny I don't get it and

110
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:01,050
then like other times yeah dad these

111
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:03,750
kids were nasty like they're you know

112
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:06,060
like doing the whole eye thing like

113
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,880
making fun of how small my eyes were but

114
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:11,700
it's like like my eyes weren't even that

115
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,530
small or they would say I eat dog which

116
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,330
I didn't understand at that time because

117
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:18,270
like even though I grew up in a family

118
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:20,160
none of us ate dog so I like I wasn't

119
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:22,109
even told about dog meat so I was just

120
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,340
like why would I eat a dog what the hell

121
00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:25,050
like what are you people talking about

122
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:27,210
like how is that making fun of me what

123
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:29,520
never done it so like that stuff never

124
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:32,370
hurt me but it is just like weird that

125
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,870
all these kids like knew all the racist

126
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:35,550
 like who the taught them all

127
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:37,020
this like their parents like my

128
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,090
parents never taught me I know any of

129
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,889
this stuff so I never understood like

130
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,669
where this was coming from yeah kids are

131
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:44,610
so shitty

132
00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:47,370
but yeah so like this the teasing like

133
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:50,009
it just went on the my entire life even

134
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:52,139
though like I never really reacted I was

135
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:54,180
just like okay they would just still

136
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:56,970
continue to like make fun of me for who

137
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,949
I was like my name's and and like

138
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:00,900
they found out about my Korean name cuz

139
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:02,909
like my mom she dropped me off at school

140
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,740
and she was like bird nah I think I like

141
00:05:02,909 --> 00:05:06,659
my dad I don't know what my parents drop

142
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:08,819
me off and they're like have a good day

143
00:05:06,659 --> 00:05:10,800
hon BR and then like one of the kids is

144
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:12,840
like honey or when she called you hon BR

145
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,069
or whatever she called you and I was

146
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,930
like oh that's my Korean name and then

147
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:17,969
that girl went on and told everyone like

148
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:19,110
Oh Lily has a different name first of

149
00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:21,180
all not none of her business

150
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:24,060
like she shouldn't be telling everyone

151
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,889
that so then people like found out by my

152
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,930
name they all like it started to turn

153
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:30,330
into a game how do you spell Lily's

154
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:32,580
other names they try to butcher my name

155
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,770
so they would be like honey you'll hunt

156
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:36,659
by you'll like I don't understand what

157
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:38,699
was this whole fascination with like who

158
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:40,529
I was like just people just need to shut

159
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:42,150
up and mind their business like I minded

160
00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:43,560
not my own business as a kid I don't

161
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,490
understand why people had to like butt

162
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,009
into my business

163
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:49,440
I'm such an angry kid huh so like that

164
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:52,169
the teasing and stuff like went on for a

165
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,270
long time like I said followed me all

166
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:56,099
throughout elementary school so it kind

167
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:58,289
of like the the Bowling's all the

168
00:05:56,099 --> 00:06:00,870
teasing it started to get to my head

169
00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:02,550
around maybe fourth grade fifth grade

170
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:04,229
cuz you know that's when you're in

171
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:05,759
that's starting to get into that stage

172
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:07,379
where you just don't understand things

173
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,870
well anyways so then I started to like

174
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:12,900
believe what they're saying like maybe

175
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:14,430
maybe my culture is weird as I remember

176
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,949
this one time I think it was like third

177
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:18,810
grade third grade or second grade came

178
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:21,900
to school like this is Halloween and

179
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:23,520
people were like dressing up for it and

180
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,289
I remember the other the previous

181
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,389
Halloween days like first grade second

182
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:30,150
grade I didn't really have a costume

183
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:31,949
everyone else showed up in costumes and

184
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:34,800
I'll just say always going on there like

185
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:37,320
it's Halloween we all dressed up so then

186
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,719
I wanted to participate I told my

187
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,639
parents like well I want to participate

188
00:06:38,719 --> 00:06:43,459
this year and like I would see people

189
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,399
dressing up as princesses and stuff so I

190
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:49,159
had my humble my Korean my traditional

191
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:50,509
dress as a kid so I was like oh I'll

192
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:52,969
wear this because I always thought I

193
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:58,549
look so cute in it even as a kid I'm

194
00:06:52,969 --> 00:07:00,679
starting to tear up oh oh oh I might

195
00:06:58,549 --> 00:07:02,929
actually cry like if you guys follow me

196
00:07:00,679 --> 00:07:04,579
on Twitter I posted like pictures of me

197
00:07:02,929 --> 00:07:07,459
because my sister posted pictures of me

198
00:07:04,579 --> 00:07:10,999
crying during Coco this might happen in

199
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:12,769
today's video oh oh that's such a

200
00:07:10,999 --> 00:07:15,709
crybaby when it comes to this oh

201
00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:17,869
so anyways I decided to go show up to

202
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:20,509
school in my thumb book and then people

203
00:07:17,869 --> 00:07:23,389
like on me so hard for wearing this

204
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:24,769
oh god like I was made fun of for what I

205
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:25,639
wore I was like why are you people

206
00:07:24,769 --> 00:07:28,159

207
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:31,129
oh like my makeup is ruined now oh

208
00:07:28,159 --> 00:07:33,259
 this is gonna be the worst and get

209
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:37,159
ready with me video ever because my

210
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:38,989
makeup is fix my concealer on today so

211
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:41,479
these kids like on me for

212
00:07:38,989 --> 00:07:43,489
wearing like my traditional dress like

213
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:46,039
that part probably hurt me the most as a

214
00:07:43,489 --> 00:07:47,569
kid because I thought I look so cute but

215
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:49,369
then people like made fun of me so

216
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:51,889
that's what I think I like started to

217
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:53,719
try to assimilate try to fit in to the

218
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:56,389
culture that's when I started to like

219
00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:59,029
reject my culture or try to hide who I

220
00:07:56,389 --> 00:08:00,619
was and try to fit into who they were I

221
00:07:59,029 --> 00:08:02,239
might just have to wear glasses today

222
00:08:00,619 --> 00:08:04,519
because my makeup is just gonna be

223
00:08:02,239 --> 00:08:06,649
 up so then like I would watch a

224
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:08,389
whole bunch of TV so I watched like a

225
00:08:06,649 --> 00:08:11,089
bunch of Disney Channel and stuff and

226
00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:13,939
I'd always hear talk about like oh mom

227
00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:15,110
make me meatloaf make me leftovers and I

228
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:17,119
was just like what the is meatloaf

229
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:18,889
what the is leftovers so I'd this

230
00:08:17,119 --> 00:08:20,869
is when I tell my mom hey can you make

231
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:22,579
me meatloaf and leftovers cuz in my

232
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:24,319
family we didn't have leftovers cuz we

233
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:25,399
finish our plate so my mom's just

234
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,379
feeling the meatloaf what the

235
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:29,719
 is leftovers but she tried which I

236
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:32,240
appreciate I also like one and my mom to

237
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:34,430
enroll me into like softball because all

238
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,829
the white girls in my classes would talk

239
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:38,389
about being in softball and I just feel

240
00:08:36,829 --> 00:08:40,159
like what the is softball never

241
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:42,319
heard of this and before my life

242
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,389
so I wanted to fit in I asked my mom to

243
00:08:42,319 --> 00:08:46,040
enroll me but that didn't work out

244
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:48,230
because I wasn't athletic at all as a

245
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,279
kid so that didn't last feeling left out

246
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:53,089
as a kid

247
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:55,610
school made me really you know kind of

248
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:58,160
upset but every I still be going to

249
00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:00,079
church every Sunday where I'd be

250
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,249
surrounded by people like because it was

251
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:02,600
a Korean church I'd be surrounded by

252
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:04,699
people more like me so that's when I

253
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,370
felt you know the safest oh yeah that's

254
00:09:04,699 --> 00:09:09,259
like the only time I felt happy this was

255
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:12,189
also the time when I started to realize

256
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:15,410
how I'm dramatic and how scandalous

257
00:09:12,189 --> 00:09:17,779
Korean churches were because my parents

258
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:20,720
were pretty big and like they had a high

259
00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:23,029
suspicion at church so like once there's

260
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,790
like a scandal that happens at church

261
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:28,629
like or like a small dispute this church

262
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:31,759
splits in half people leave people stay

263
00:09:28,629 --> 00:09:33,350
like it just goes crazy my family were

264
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:35,749
always the ones to leave because like

265
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:37,579
they've worked there so we'd always have

266
00:09:35,749 --> 00:09:39,589
to jump around different churches like

267
00:09:37,579 --> 00:09:41,779
what like it was it was kind of annoying

268
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:44,089
as a kid because I would set this like

269
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:45,439
moving cities where you settle down make

270
00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:47,360
friends and all of a sudden you have to

271
00:09:45,439 --> 00:09:50,180
leave because like some goes down

272
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:53,360
this happened probably like six times in

273
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:54,769
my childhood where I had a where I made

274
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,629
friends and then we had to leave because

275
00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:58,639
all this so that kind of made me

276
00:09:56,629 --> 00:10:00,379
hate I just had just started to develop

277
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:02,629
some animosity towards the Korean

278
00:10:00,379 --> 00:10:04,939
churches which has followed me since now

279
00:10:02,629 --> 00:10:06,199
say I'm feeling left out of at school

280
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:08,899
follow me all throughout elementary

281
00:10:06,199 --> 00:10:11,209
school but like this is the time like

282
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:13,610
around 6:00 or 5th grade was the time

283
00:10:11,209 --> 00:10:15,829
when YouTube started becoming big this

284
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:17,540
was when a Higa remember him I

285
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:20,149
don't know why his name is digger first

286
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:21,740
of all or nigahiga I guess that's how

287
00:10:20,149 --> 00:10:24,110
you pronounce day I'm sorry he's like

288
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:26,600
the number one most popular youtuber and

289
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:28,339
like I think a lot at that time it was

290
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,480
like mostly Asian people who kind of

291
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:34,250
dominated Michelle Phan loves Beauty

292
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,410
nigahiga kept jumbo it was all like

293
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:38,179
Asian people who were popular online and

294
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:39,829
everyone watched them so that's I

295
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:42,139
started to like you know feel a little

296
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:43,910
bit better about being Asian like having

297
00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:47,029
some sort of Asian pride I was seeing

298
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:48,740
others do so well online I went to a

299
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:50,449
different middle school from everyone

300
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:53,089
else in my elementary school like I went

301
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:55,579
to a special one I forgot to mention I

302
00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:58,160
was in they enrolled me into the ESL

303
00:10:55,579 --> 00:11:00,019
program because I never spoke at school

304
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,250
so they assumed that I couldn't speak

305
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:03,139
English even though

306
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:05,839
fluent so they made me enroll into the

307
00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:07,879
ESL program and that this is what I like

308
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,529
started to stop speaking Korean and then

309
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:11,449
I started losing my fluency so I kind of

310
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:13,910
have like animosity towards my school

311
00:11:11,449 --> 00:11:16,370
for making me do that anyway so then I

312
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:18,139
go to middle school like a special

313
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:20,540
Middle School where they have like an IV

314
00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:22,519
program so it's like it's harder I guess

315
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:24,949
I don't know since I started this middle

316
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:26,750
school I there are a lot more agent more

317
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:28,339
Asian people at this school because you

318
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,779
know I was like this of course they're

319
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:31,100
few more Asian people at this school

320
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:33,470
so I'll surrounded by more people like

321
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:35,449
me like Asians became the cool kids for

322
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:38,329
the first time in my life I was still

323
00:11:35,449 --> 00:11:40,519
like getting teased by my non Asian

324
00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:43,040
friends at school like still making fun

325
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:45,290
of my eyes I wore glasses at a young age

326
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,879
and then I decided at contacts in middle

327
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:49,430
school and then I remember what my

328
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:51,769
friend at that time told me it's like oh

329
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:53,300
are your contacts little slits to fit

330
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:56,120
into your eye and I was like the

331
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:58,069
how dare you say that to me I started to

332
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,079
develop a thick skin at this time cuz I

333
00:11:58,069 --> 00:12:01,970
just like I really just didn't care like

334
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:04,250
I mean of course I care cuz it's like I

335
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:04,939
like how the could you say that but

336
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,009
it didn't hurt me

337
00:12:04,939 --> 00:12:09,319
he just annoyed me so I stopped speaking

338
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:11,149
Korean around this time I only spoke

339
00:12:09,319 --> 00:12:13,490
Korean to like my Korean friends parents

340
00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:15,019
or my Ida needs to be Korean to my own

341
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:17,329
parents I only spoke Korean to maybe my

342
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:19,699
grandma so around middle school was when

343
00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:22,009
a kpop I guess started becoming more

344
00:12:19,699 --> 00:12:24,319
globalized this was one I think so no

345
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:25,939
she did G or maybe that wasn't in

346
00:12:24,319 --> 00:12:27,559
elementary school for me it was I have

347
00:12:25,939 --> 00:12:30,019
6th grade or seventh grade when she

348
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:31,879
became popular I know sorry sorry my

349
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:34,220
Super Junior was big and middle school

350
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:36,050
for me and like 2 p.m. again and again

351
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,730
remember that so yeah that stuff

352
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:39,439
became popular and that became more

353
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:42,170
people who are non Korean started to

354
00:12:39,439 --> 00:12:44,209
find out what kpop was which was kind of

355
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:45,740
like at that time kind of exciting for

356
00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:48,050
me because a like a little bit of my

357
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:49,639
culture was getting spread out and we're

358
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:51,620
learning more about it which I thought

359
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:53,660
was really cool so I could like connect

360
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:55,610
to these people more like I had no idea

361
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:57,800
what the was gonna happen with all

362
00:12:55,610 --> 00:13:00,050
this also linked I remember Korean

363
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:02,660
dramas are getting bigger to like put

364
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:05,029
the nom de Boys Over Flowers was huge

365
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:07,129
Christian pure hahaha so yeah I really

366
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:08,930
liked it that people were acknowledging

367
00:13:07,129 --> 00:13:09,880
my culture a little bit middle school

368
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:12,009
was

369
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,959
do you sit for me like I didn't really

370
00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:15,459
have to do with a lot of bullying or

371
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:17,500
stuff because like most of my friends

372
00:13:15,459 --> 00:13:19,480
were Asian because there are more Asian

373
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,680
kids at this school but then once I was

374
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,829
getting used to being part of the

375
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:25,899
in-crowd my family decided to move and

376
00:13:23,829 --> 00:13:28,600
we moved to an even wider city like

377
00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:30,310
super white at that point I was so done

378
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,949
because of like I already told you guys

379
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:34,509
about how I had a move Church church to

380
00:13:32,949 --> 00:13:36,399
church to a different Church and stuff

381
00:13:34,509 --> 00:13:38,380
all the time because of like all the

382
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,569
scandals and stuff so this was like my

383
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,339
first time moving to a different place

384
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:44,170
having to adjust to a completely

385
00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:45,910
different new school with different

386
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:47,800
people once I looked like I was actually

387
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:49,329
trying to fit in fit in at a different

388
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,699
place where there was like no one like

389
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:53,560
me or barely anyone like me so I was

390
00:13:51,699 --> 00:13:55,930
like kind of angry this was when I

391
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:57,850
started to become like the emo kid like

392
00:13:55,930 --> 00:14:00,190
I had the sushi hair and stuff like if

393
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:02,709
you ask my friends now who I met in

394
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:04,149
middle school when I moved they'll tell

395
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:06,310
you how like different I was

396
00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:08,380
compared to now like they all know I

397
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:10,269
hated them when I moved because it was

398
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:12,639
just like I hate I just hated like

399
00:14:10,269 --> 00:14:14,170
having to adjust again but it's funny

400
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,930
because like once I moved to that city

401
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:19,089
the school assigned me cuz I moved in

402
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:21,459
the middle of eighth grade that school

403
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:22,930
assigned to me like someone to show me

404
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:24,910
around and it was like the only Kurt

405
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:25,779
like one Korean girl in my school and I

406
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:27,970
don't know if they did that on purpose

407
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:29,829
or ever yeah so like I had to restart

408
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:32,170
everything all over again I absolutely

409
00:14:29,829 --> 00:14:33,279
hated that school like I really didn't I

410
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,959
hated it

411
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,910
like this was when I start to dish a lot

412
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:40,149
because I was just like so done with

413
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:42,370
everyone also like at this school Asians

414
00:14:40,149 --> 00:14:44,170
were like at the bottom of like the

415
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:46,839
social pyramid everyone like just

416
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:49,240
 on Asians so much even at this

417
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:51,160
school they're like Asian boys who made

418
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,420
fun of Asians because they wanted to fit

419
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,279
in with the white kids and which I

420
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,660
thought was like so how pathetic but

421
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:58,120
then I actually started to become like

422
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:00,610
that kind of person later on so this was

423
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,500
a when my denial for my culture started

424
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:04,269
coming back when people would talk

425
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,250
about being Asians I just feel like yeah

426
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:08,050
yeah that's true just cuz I was just

427
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:10,240
like so done at that point which of

428
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:11,589
course I regret entirely now this is

429
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,449
when I started to be like I would never

430
00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:16,089
date an Asian guy because like I was

431
00:15:13,449 --> 00:15:18,850
just I was just really like denying my

432
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:20,709
culture heavily it is so hot in here

433
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:22,620
like I cringe looking back at how I

434
00:15:20,709 --> 00:15:24,300
acted before

435
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:26,520
how I just thought it was cool to hate

436
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:28,020
on my own my own culture alright I

437
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,550
didn't want people to hate me so I just

438
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:32,370
like wanted to fit in

439
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:34,050
cuz I was new moving on to high school I

440
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:36,720
think this was like the first time kpop

441
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:38,370
like really became globalized I mean

442
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,960
it's nothing compared to now but a lot

443
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:42,630
more people were getting into it like

444
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:45,360
this is what I think Korea brew started

445
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:47,010
to become prevalent in my life I already

446
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,530
told you guys about my whole high school

447
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:51,600
experience in a previous video I told

448
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:53,610
you how like guys Asian guys came up to

449
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,100
me because this was like people started

450
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:57,990
to fetishize me for being Korean which

451
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:01,170
was gross just because of the whole like

452
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:03,750
globalization of kpop at this time like

453
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:05,310
I didn't realize it until later on that

454
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:08,070
some people just wanted to be my friend

455
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:10,080
because I was Korean and once I figured

456
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:11,910
that out I just dropped those people I

457
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,500
just got really mad because it's like

458
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:15,450
really people are just using me for who

459
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,340
I like my race rather than it's like my

460
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:19,410
personality yeah this is a really

461
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:20,130
different part of my life compared to

462
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:22,560
how I grew up

463
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:24,390
people sign to be more interested in in

464
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,820
Korean culture but it wasn't exactly

465
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:29,250
Korean culture it was just the

466
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:31,410
entertainment side of like Korea like

467
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:33,030
kpop and Korean dramas this is like all

468
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:35,310
people were knew about Korea at that

469
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:38,400
time so then people just assumed what

470
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:39,870
they see on TV or whatever is my life

471
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,610
it's like no it's not

472
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:43,560
my life isn't a Korean drama

473
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:44,940
like none of that is true but

474
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,040
people just start to assume because

475
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:48,900
that's all they really knew this is when

476
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:52,500
I kind of like started developing a

477
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:54,270
hatred for anyone who like mentioned my

478
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,370
race it just kind of triggered me

479
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:58,860
whenever people brought up my race I was

480
00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:01,380
always just skeptical about people so I

481
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:03,690
kind of just wanted to deny my culture I

482
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:05,550
didn't want to date a Korean guy at this

483
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:07,110
point even though I did like in freshman

484
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:10,230
year but like after that I was just like

485
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:11,040
no I want a non-asian guy because Asians

486
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,720
aren't cool

487
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,090
that never happened though but it's just

488
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,430
cringy to see how I was as a person back

489
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:19,650
in the day after high school I kind of

490
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:22,320
like grew up started to feel a bit more

491
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:24,780
confident in Who I am and more

492
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:27,360
appreciation for my culture like even

493
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:29,430
though I don't speak Korean that well

494
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,500
like I mean I still speak it but not as

495
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:33,420
well as I used to but I still understand

496
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,559
it like fully I was still aware of like

497
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,690
Korean

498
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:40,139
like all the going down like I

499
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:41,759
can't escape from it who I am I don't

500
00:17:40,139 --> 00:17:45,769
know what the that noise is out

501
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:48,419
there so holy

502
00:17:45,769 --> 00:17:50,700
haha I told you people sorry to

503
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:52,860
fetishize me this is like even worse now

504
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,360
at this point after high school like

505
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:56,490
guys just wanting to get to know me

506
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:58,950
because I was Korean they wanted a

507
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:00,990
Korean girlfriend so badly cuz like they

508
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:03,600
assume we all look like k-pop stars

509
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:07,110
which I don't understand so I grew up

510
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:09,029
after high school I guess the gardener's

511
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:12,210
are out to there so then now it's like

512
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:14,730
not people are becoming more interested

513
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:17,309
in Korea so that stuff kind of bothers

514
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:19,559
me now because those thing people who

515
00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:22,740
made fun of me at in elementary school

516
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:25,379
for being Korean are now like totally

517
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:27,749
like kpop fetishizes and stuff and like

518
00:18:25,379 --> 00:18:30,299
I get it people change but it's just

519
00:18:27,749 --> 00:18:33,330
like really you bullied me all my life

520
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:35,519
for who I was but now you're trying to

521
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:37,769
you're trying to like go after that my

522
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:39,360
culture now I'm just dumbfounded by that

523
00:18:37,769 --> 00:18:41,039
now when non Korean people tell me about

524
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,289
they're learning Korean or like they

525
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:45,389
love Korea for the culture I'm always

526
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:47,490
like oh really like what about the

527
00:18:45,389 --> 00:18:49,649
culture do you like half the time it's

528
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:51,629
either tape blown up eighty percent of

529
00:18:49,649 --> 00:18:53,999
the time is cuz they watch a lot of

530
00:18:51,629 --> 00:18:56,100
Korean dramas or listen to a lot of kpop

531
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:57,389
and the other 20% of time they don't get

532
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,529
me a straight-up answer like they don't

533
00:18:57,389 --> 00:19:04,289
give me a good enough answer they're

534
00:18:58,529 --> 00:19:06,119
just like really you just like the

535
00:19:04,289 --> 00:19:08,580
culture for the superficial side of it

536
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:11,340
rather than the history behind of Korea

537
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:13,049
all my life only probably three people

538
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,970
have given me good at good enough

539
00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:16,379
answers to why they're interested in

540
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:18,480
Korea because most of the time is

541
00:19:16,379 --> 00:19:20,999
because of kpop and this is why I like

542
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,070
angers me so much to see people taking

543
00:19:20,999 --> 00:19:25,559
advantage of my culture making videos

544
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:27,210
about Korea like making videos about

545
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:28,860
Korea even though they never lived in

546
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:30,570
Korea or they don't even speak the

547
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:32,549
language I mean there are definitely

548
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:34,889
youtubers out there who have lived in

549
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:36,720
Korea who have good input on it and

550
00:19:34,889 --> 00:19:38,009
actually like learn the language there

551
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,049
are people who make like full videos

552
00:19:38,009 --> 00:19:41,490
about Korea who don't even like bothered

553
00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:43,139
about living in Korea who don't even

554
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:45,149
bother to learn the language which kind

555
00:19:43,139 --> 00:19:46,200
of just makes me irritate it a bit like

556
00:19:45,149 --> 00:19:48,150
how are you going to talk about the

557
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,410
culture when you don't even under

558
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:50,970
not what these people are talking about

559
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:53,160
this kind of turned into a really angry

560
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:54,810
video I don't know oh my my emotions

561
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:57,390
were all over the place like I was

562
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:58,680
crying I was laughing and now at this

563
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:00,780
point I'm just angry

564
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:02,580
I'm not saying only Koreans experienced

565
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:04,470
this of course I'm pretty sure lots of

566
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:06,600
different races experienced this like I

567
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:08,910
grew up around weeaboos now I'm just

568
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,200
surrounded by Korea boos I just think

569
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:12,000
it's disgusting how people take

570
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,860
advantage or like they look at Asian

571
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,660
culture as a whole and make like a

572
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:17,400
mockery out of it like I'm sure they do

573
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:20,970
that to other different races as well

574
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,710
but I just see it so much in a Japanese

575
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,630
and Korean culture especially Korean

576
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:26,730
culture now and it's just weird seeing

577
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:28,200
how my guys I said I grew up getting

578
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:30,600
 on for being Korean and now

579
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:32,490
people are just like worshiping my feet

580
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,960
because of who I am it's like maybe as a

581
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:35,970
kid I would have liked this but now that

582
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,620
I've grown up I'm like no this is not

583
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:39,390
what I wanted at all but every single

584
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:42,210
time I go back to Korea or whenever I

585
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:44,430
see my my grandpa in Korea who doesn't

586
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:46,830
live here with us he always has to put

587
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:48,570
my ass on blast about not being fluent

588
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:50,370
in Korean he already always like scolds

589
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:51,870
my parents for not teaching me Korean

590
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:53,190
even though like he doesn't hear he

591
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:55,500
doesn't know that Korean was my first

592
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:57,300
language and there's no really any use

593
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:59,370
for me to speak Korean here like yeah

594
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,540
it'd be helpful for me now but like when

595
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:01,950
I was growing up like you have to

596
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,360
understand all this that happened

597
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:05,160
to me so I was like I hate it how he

598
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,010
doesn't understand about that like I

599
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:09,840
wanted to fit in so badly that you know

600
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:12,210
the consequences was forgetting who I

601
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:14,370
was it's like not only my grandpa but a

602
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:15,960
lot of other Koreans from Korea feel

603
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:17,820
this way they're like they have like

604
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,170
hatred towards Korean Americans who

605
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,400
don't speak Korean that well because

606
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:22,500
they're like well you're Korean first

607
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,910
not American but it's like you have to

608
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,680
understand you know we don't get much

609
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:27,480
usage out of it so I just wish they

610
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:30,300
would understand that so it's like I get

611
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:32,340
 on for being American I get it

612
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:34,140
on for being Korean I don't know that

613
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:36,900
everything's so confusing for me at this

614
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:39,090
point in the end I'm still proud of my

615
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,890
culture I'm proud of Who I am even

616
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:43,640
though like sometimes the I talk a

617
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:47,040
lot about Korea of how light the whole

618
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:49,470
hierarchical system it has and how and

619
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:52,650
how homogeneous it is like despite all

620
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:54,540
that I'm still proud to be Korean I'm

621
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:56,970
proud of how far we've come

622
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:58,730
started off as a third world country now

623
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:00,740
we're flourishing so incredible

624
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:02,480
that now people just are really

625
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:03,860
interested even though like of course I

626
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,390
hate the fact that there's a bunch of

627
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:07,460
Korean booze out there I mean it's great

628
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:08,660
that people know more about us because

629
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:10,520
they're just always gonna be shitty

630
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:12,020
people along the way who make a mockery

631
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:14,179
out of your culture but of course there

632
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:17,030
are other people who actually fascinated

633
00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:18,830
by it and respect it so oh I'm finally

634
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:19,940
done with my makeup I'm gonna go fix my

635
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:23,240
hair and then I'll be back

636
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:25,010
as always my bangs are a mess god I hate

637
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:27,140
my hair so much I need a haircut anyways

638
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,880
that is pretty much it for this video I

639
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:30,919
feel like I'm gonna offend a lot of

640
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,780
people through this video but honestly

641
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:35,150
it just really is my opinion and

642
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:37,250
standpoint on everything growing up as a

643
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:39,500
Korean American no hard feelings for

644
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:41,179
anyone I really hope you guys don't take

645
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,580
this the wrong way but feel free to

646
00:22:41,179 --> 00:22:45,169

647
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:47,660
don't have to be Korean or American or

648
00:22:45,169 --> 00:22:49,730
whatever to grow up feeling a bit you

649
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:51,919

00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:54,620

cultural differences and whatnot

654
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,370
