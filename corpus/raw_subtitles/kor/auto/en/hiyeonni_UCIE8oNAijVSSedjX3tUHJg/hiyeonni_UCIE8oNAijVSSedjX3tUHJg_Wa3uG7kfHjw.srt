I've already filmed everything this is a

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,439
long video clearly I was gonna make it a

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:23,900
part 1 in part 2 but then I think it's

6
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,730
such an important story art that it's

7
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:29,269
just better that it's one video so you

00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:32,300

18
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,600
hi guys it's me Annie welcome back to my

19
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:55,280
channel I apologize for the background

20
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,850
situation right now I'm in the middle of

21
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,289
a move

22
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:02,930
today is Tuesday April 21st and I'm

23
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:04,070
moving to Seattle finally this Saturday

24
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:06,440
so I've been living out of a suitcase

25
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:08,180
for the past week but I can't make a

26
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,340
camera because I knew if I felt inspired

27
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:13,039
making a video would be really good for

28
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:15,470
my mental health and self-care so here I

29
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:17,720
am making a video today on a topic that

30
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,920
I think is really really important and I

31
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,770
think it's really important to make this

32
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:24,590
video because so much of my identity is

33
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:26,240
morphed into my work and what I do I

34
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:28,160
started doing some research into how I

35
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,319
would put this video together and then I

36
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:33,410
remembered a few months ago I actually

37
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:36,860
did a quick interview with a non-profit

38
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:39,530
up in Canada called Project T like te a

39
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:41,750
and I spoke to the founder her name is

40
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:44,539
Lexi I believe Lexi and the founder

41
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:45,800
Alexei reached out to me asking if I if

42
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:48,560
she could ask me a few questions about

43
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:50,479
my identity as an Asian American and how

44
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,550
that has shaped you know where I am

45
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,050
today being a mental health provider and

46
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:56,869
you know answering those questions was

47
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:58,640
such a cathartic experience for me and I

48
00:01:56,869 --> 00:02:01,039
was really happy to be able to share a

49
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,739
little bit of my experience to maybe

50
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:05,090
help with what their missions and values

51
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:07,099
are and you know getting into that I

52
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:10,009
have their website open here their

53
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:12,200
project TTA because they want to teach

54
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:14,510
and educate the East Asian community

55
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,610
about the concept of self identity and

56
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:18,920
emotional wellness and how they're doing

57
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:19,650
that is they want to engage the youth in

58
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,909
the East Asia

59
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,159
communities through like open

60
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:24,450
conversations and hosting events so a

61
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:26,519
lot of what I wanted to say in this

62
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,709
video I already said in the interview so

63
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:31,379
I'm pretty much going to regurgitate my

64
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:32,939
answers in that interview in video form

65
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:35,129
today and kind of add on a little bit

66
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:38,040
more at the end of what it's like being

67
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:39,720
an asian-american therapist and the

68
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,579
challenges and the rewards that have

69
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,799
come with that so it's gonna be kind of

70
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:45,959
a long video so let me just get straight

71
00:02:43,799 --> 00:02:48,030
into it so the first question that they

72
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:49,739
asked me was what's your ethnicity and

73
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:52,500
multicultural experience

74
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:53,879
I am South Korean born in Seoul I moved

75
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,579
to the state's when I was six years old

76
00:02:53,879 --> 00:03:00,569
in 1999 I believe I was born on April

77
00:02:56,579 --> 00:03:02,940
4th 1994 I was only in first grade at

78
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:05,879
the time when I moved but I distinctly

79
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:08,549
remember how stark the transition was

80
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:11,400
for myself and my family I just remember

81
00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:13,889
feeling like my family had landed into

82
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,780
this vacuum where I could not understand

83
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:18,299
anything going on because of a language

84
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,859
barrier all of the signs and everything

85
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:21,870
was so confusing they all looked like

86
00:03:19,859 --> 00:03:23,970
worms to me you know we moved to a

87
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:25,859
predominantly Caucasian town there were

88
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,900
not many Asians especially we first

89
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:30,540
moved there there was like no Asians and

90
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:33,810
at the time we didn't have the language

91
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:36,120
or the awareness necessary to put like

92
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:38,370
labels on what our experiences were like

93
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,799
my family and I but now that I look back

94
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:42,329
we faced a lot of racism and

95
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,299
discrimination while living in that

96
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:46,949
community one example would be like when

97
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:48,720
I would go grocery shopping with my mom

98
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:50,040
and my mom would you know my mom doesn't

99
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,989
know English she was just trying her

100
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,900
best and I remember we were at the

101
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:57,569
checkout line and the cashier

102
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,379
started laughing at my mom because she

103
00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:01,470
had an accent

104
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:04,500
and then he I remember specifically

105
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:07,859
being angry because laughter that kind

106
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,389
of nonverbal cue is clearly something

107
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:11,609
that you don't need words to understand

108
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:12,150
mime I could see my mom was visibly

109
00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:15,599
upset

110
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:17,459
this man was laughing at her I became so

111
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,590
angry and he brought more of his friends

112
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:21,810
over from like the other cash registers

113
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:23,820
and if I remember correctly they were

114
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:25,380
like egging her on to keep speaking so

115
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,909
they could make fun of her and no one

116
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:29,580
stepped in we didn't have smartphones

117
00:04:26,909 --> 00:04:32,040
back then to document it and you know

118
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,450
expose these people so

119
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,880
it was really rough growing up in that

120
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:37,860
environment and it really really mess a

121
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,720
lot with my identity the second question

122
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,520
that they asked me was growing up as an

123
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,020
Asian American if you felt that you

124
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,700
faced more expectations from your

125
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:47,250
parents to achieve greater success in

126
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:50,700
your peers who are not Asian and I said

127
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:54,600
of course at the time it felt so unfair

128
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:57,450
that like susie-q and Jeremy and Stephen

129
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,280
and all these people were like they

130
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:02,640
whether they were trying their best or

131
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:06,690
not it felt like their interactions with

132
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:10,050
their family was a lot more casual like

133
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:12,360
not as scary or strict as my

134
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:15,290
interactions were with my parents I felt

135
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,340
like my parents are being really strict

136
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:19,260
unreasonable and having really

137
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:21,060
unrealistic expectations for a child

138
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,950
because you know like when you're a

139
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,720
child I think at least for me I was

140
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:26,760
aware I was a child you know that I'm

141
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,710
not gonna be perfect and and I was in

142
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,390
like first grade I'm like if I screw up

143
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:31,590
first grade like I'll try again and

144
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,930
second grade and third grade now I'm

145
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:35,610
like you know I learn and whatever but

146
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:37,080
now that I look back you know there's

147
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:39,120
always a lot of more clarity in

148
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,100
retrospect that kind of stepping into my

149
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,590
parents shoes at the time in their

150
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:47,010
perspective what a good parent was and

151
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:48,660
what a good child was those terms had

152
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:50,970
very different they looked very

153
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:53,460
different to them then they looked to me

154
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:55,620
or to my environment so their standards

155
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,540
were different but I you know I can't

156
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:00,150
blame them for that there were cultural

157
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:02,910
reasons for that generational issues for

158
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:04,410
that and me having been thrown into this

159
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:07,800
kind of like Western culture and

160
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:09,300
education I was coming home with a lot

161
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,890
of information that my parents had never

162
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,600
learned before like they learns

163
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:15,000
differently from their Korean background

164
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:18,630
educational background so it was kind of

165
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,680
the beginning of like a wall that I felt

166
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:24,330
between me and my parents because I was

167
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,730
starting to kind of come into my own

168
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:30,450
identity of who I am and blah blah blah

169
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:31,890
and Who I am in the outside world was

170
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:34,920
very different from who I was in the

171
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:36,510
inside world with my parents and yet no

172
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:39,000
matter where I was I didn't really feel

173
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:41,010
like I truly belonged and that leads to

174
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,780
the third question which was which

175
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:44,580
mental wellness related issues have you

176
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,270
personally experienced or thought deeply

177
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,560
about

178
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:48,000
and I'm gonna just read this part

179
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,680
because you know when you type something

180
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,210
out you have more time to edit things so

181
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,980
I feel like I've worded this pretty well

182
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,930
so I'm just gonna read it I think as far

183
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,940
as I can remember I struggle deeply with

184
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,560
wanting to feel like I belonged whether

185
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,330
it was the family environment that I

186
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,820
grew up in as a child or being the only

187
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:05,040
Asian kid in town or honestly probably a

188
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:07,470
lot of both I always wanted to belong

189
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,600
this desire led to many childhood and

190
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:11,400
adolescent years of self-criticism and

191
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,350
people-pleasing behavior that were

192
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,360
absolutely debilitating to my sense of

193
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:17,040
self when I entered college I

194
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,570
experienced some severely traumatic

195
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,940
experiences that hurt me physically

196
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:22,380
emotionally and mentally I have been

197
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,020
dealing with things that I'm not crying

198
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:26,760
it's just allergies I promise I have

199
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:29,460
been dealing with anxiety panic attacks

200
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:31,140
and depression all my life and only

201
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:33,330
through finding my own coping skills

202
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:35,430
supportive circles and therapy have I

203
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:37,290
been able to deal learn and move forward

204
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:39,060
but it's a continuous journey of

205
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,190
checking in with myself and doing soft

206
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,920
care like eating food to sustain my body

207
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:46,230
I need to engage in self-care to sustain

208
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:48,300
my mental health you know this part when

209
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:50,010
I answer this it's initially an essay I

210
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,710
had to kind of shorten it up for up for

211
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:56,430
them but I struggled a lot with wanting

212
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:59,100
to belong I wanted to just I wanted to

213
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:01,680
belong with my family but I felt like I

214
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:03,630
was already so different I wanted to

215
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,430
belong at school with the other kids but

216
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:07,680
I looked different I spoke a different

217
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:09,960
language I came from an entirely

218
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,280
different background moved from another

219
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,380
freaking country on the other side of

220
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,260
the world I wanted to belong in my

221
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:18,990
community and wanted to belong and that

222
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:21,620
kind of wanting to belong as I already

223
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:25,680
kind of said in the interview led to

224
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:27,450
excuse me led to a lot many years of I

225
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,970
think I just kind of blamed it on myself

226
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:32,730
a lot I had a lot of social anxiety

227
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:35,280
growing up because I was eager to please

228
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:39,270
anyone who would help me to feel like I

229
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:41,370
belonged and I was a people pleaser I

230
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:44,130
was a goody two-shoes and that people

231
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:45,480
step all over me I was fake that was a

232
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:47,790
big thing like you know I can admit that

233
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,890
now I was really fake I didn't want to

234
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:51,750
do certain things for people but like I

235
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:53,340
did it just so they would give me

236
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,960
something out of it which was the

237
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:57,570
feeling of acceptance and feeling of

238
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,910
belonging so but then like when kids

239
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,880
would accuse me of being fake

240
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:04,130
I'd be like so heartbroken because I

241
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,680
couldn't connect like the deeper issue

242
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:08,960
that I had with why was I being such a

243
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,660
people-pleaser I just thought I'm just a

244
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:14,060
nice person why are people so mean to me

245
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:15,860
and I do think I was still a nice person

246
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:19,820
I think my intentions were pure but the

247
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:22,820
execution was just not transparent to my

248
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:25,280
peers because it was so really quick

249
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:27,920
what I start explaining to them that all

250
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:30,350
of this stems from my deeper issues of

251
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,940
wanting to belong like where do you even

252
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,800
begin a conversation like that

253
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:35,660
how has your culture shaped your

254
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:39,530
identity yeah so I struggled immensely

255
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:40,850
with my cultural identity maybe because

256
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,980
it was the age that I moved to the

257
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:45,530
states where I wanted to you know belong

258
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:47,720
so much but the way I looked the food

259
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:50,600
that my parents packed for me for lunch

260
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:53,600
the language that I spoke it all was

261
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,640
like other other outsider outsider and I

262
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,380
hated that you know so I did not want to

263
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,540
be Korean I didn't want to look like

264
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:01,460
this or speak my language I felt like

265
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:03,860
because I was like this no one was

266
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:06,170
liking me and I had a lot of like

267
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:07,640
aggression and anger towards myself and

268
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:10,760
a lot of aggression and anger towards my

269
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:13,040
parents and there was an incident that

270
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:15,650
happened when I was eight so two years

271
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,320
after moving to the States and I still

272
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:21,110
remember it now and it's just kind of it

273
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,540
speaks volumes on how like my childlike

274
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:27,260
brain was struggling so much with my

275
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:29,480
cultural identity it was Halloween and I

276
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,800
remember you know the burette there was

277
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,240
like a Halloween party at school you

278
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,040
know so like kids can stay safe and

279
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,140
stuff so like they would change the

280
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,670
gymnasium and put like games in there

281
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:40,400
and kids would come and like all dressed

282
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:42,170
up and blah blah blah and I remember I

283
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:44,030
wanted to be a fairy that year you know

284
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:46,250
eight year old girl you know I wanted to

285
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:49,070
be a fairy and then there was a blonde

286
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:52,220
wig that came with the fairy outfit and

287
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:53,660
honestly I was so excited my parents

288
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:55,250
didn't want me to wear the way cuz it

289
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:57,860
was it was like a cheap wig it looked

290
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:59,390
really ugly but when I put that blonde

291
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:03,290
wig on and looked at myself in the

292
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:04,850
mirror I felt was so beautiful and okay

293
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:08,960
now I'm a little teary eyed now thinking

294
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:10,430
of like like poor baby girl like having

295
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,620
that blonde wig and not having this

296
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:13,390
black hair I felt

297
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:15,490
and I felt like I belonged him when I

298
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:19,690
went to that Halloween party I was like

299
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:21,670
I am so cute I had the best time and

300
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:23,650
even when I got home that night I took

301
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:25,720
off my fairy costume I was in my PJs but

302
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:27,130
I wore that blonde wig and I almost

303
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,780
worked at school the next day but my mom

304
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:30,550
yelled at me so I could have but thank

305
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:33,280
God thank you mom now that I look back

306
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:35,500
but I struggled a lot with my cultural

307
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,900
identity as you can see and before I

308
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:40,990
move on to the next part like because it

309
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:44,860
took me so long to appreciate and love

310
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:47,350
my culture and being Korean I cherish it

311
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:50,020
so much more now I think I feel so

312
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:53,590
thankful that through those difficult

313
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:56,560
times it's like I had to kind of like

314
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:58,750
claw my way to the appreciation part

315
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,540
where I pushed it away and I hated it

316
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:03,490
and now I'm just like it's a it's a part

317
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:07,270
of me that makes me so much stronger

318
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:10,480
than I was ever before and it's just

319
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:12,460
like my cultural identity is it doesn't

320
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,770
look like my parents identity you know

321
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:16,600
if there was like a color to it or like

322
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:18,160
some sort of artistic representation of

323
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,510
what my cultural identity looks like

324
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,960
that's a really great art therapy

325
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:25,470
project actually anyway sorry the

326
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:28,060
therapist in music I could use that

327
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:30,850
anyway so yeah my cultural identity

328
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:32,890
looks so different from my parents and

329
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:34,840
how their canvas will look looks so

330
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:37,060
different from any other korean-american

331
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,740
out there and because of that it's so

332
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:40,510
important and because of that I cherish

333
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:42,520
it so much more now how did you think

334
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:44,170
your degree in psychology helped you

335
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,700
find your calling I love to this

336
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:47,140
question because I never really thought

337
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,100
about it until they asked me I really

338
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:50,170
had to sit down

339
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:53,050
I like held on to these questions for

340
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:55,060
days really processing the answer so I

341
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:57,490
could be as transparent as possible but

342
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:59,590
I didn't go into college wanting to

343
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:02,590
study psychology I was actually when I

344
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:04,540
was going into college I had turned down

345
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:07,780
like a full scholarship to an art school

346
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:10,720
I got full presidential scholarship to

347
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:12,070
Pratt Institute in Brooklyn and all of

348
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,960
high school was prepping for art school

349
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:15,640
because I really loved art and then I

350
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,200
ended up going to a big like state

351
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,350
school because my parents didn't really

352
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:23,050
want me to dive so like hard into such a

353
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:24,300
niche like art you know studio art they

354
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:26,520
wanted me to try out

355
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:29,340
friend degrees in different kinds of

356
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:31,530
classes and I don't know why I didn't

357
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:32,700
fight it more I don't know everything

358
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:35,280
happens for a reason so I ended up going

359
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,970
to a bigger state school and so I was

360
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,980
like I still want to do something

361
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:40,110
related to art so I thought I was gonna

362
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:43,560
be an art historian so I went into

363
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:44,970
school with an art history major and I

364
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,830
took an art history course and I needed

365
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:49,170
to you know take some random extra

366
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:50,790
courses so I took a psych 101 course cuz

367
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:54,840
everyone was taking and apparently was

368
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:57,540
easy and faint just kind of had its way

369
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:59,370
of working with me where and then again

370
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,480
like it wasn't after that psych class

371
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:03,870
where I was like I'm gonna be a

372
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:07,230
therapist but I've loved that psych 101

373
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:09,480
class everything was so fascinating like

374
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:11,070
studying the way people think and the

375
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,530
way they feel and how it's all connected

376
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:15,900
and how people like respond and react to

377
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:17,820
one another and in contrast our history

378
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:20,790
was so boring for me I'm sorry like I

379
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:23,550
love museums I love going there but like

380
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:25,320
the act of shoving so much information

381
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:27,390
into my head like this was painted in

382
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,400
this period by this person using this

383
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:30,900
technique using these materials like I

384
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,610
didn't give me a chance to really

385
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:34,650
appreciate art so that's when I realized

386
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:36,420
okay it's not really for me but that's

387
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:38,160
really what sparked my interest in

388
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:40,860
psychology and I wanted to take more

389
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:43,050
classes and I feel like as I was getting

390
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,370
to know more about psychology and these

391
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:46,530
concepts and terms

392
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:50,060
I think deep inside of me I wanted to

393
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:52,200
find out what was wrong with me in a way

394
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:53,220
growing up you know I kind of explained

395
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,960
you a little bit of what it was like

396
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:57,330
first moving to the states and growing

397
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,800
up in the environment but I always felt

398
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,030
like there was something wrong with me

399
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,100
you know like maybe that's why I

400
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:04,230
couldn't belong with my family or like

401
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:07,620
my friends there was always like this

402
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:10,130
idea or a theme of like I explore my

403
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:12,750
feelings too much and it's like a

404
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:15,060
detriment to me and it's not good to

405
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:18,570
linger too much on feelings that was

406
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:20,970
kind of like what I was taught at home

407
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:22,710
and so I was like okay there's something

408
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:24,870
wrong with Manny to figure that out and

409
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:26,790
I think that kind of subconsciously made

410
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:28,830
me more interested in psychology and

411
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:32,670
little did I know this journey to kind

412
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:35,280
of fix myself became this journey of

413
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:37,020
self-discovery where I realized this

414
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,620
this thing that I thought was a weakness

415
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,300
or an

416
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,010
shuh that i had was actually kind of a

417
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:43,140
gift in a way something that i could be

418
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:45,390
proud of something I could really use to

419
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:47,279
not only get to know myself better but

420
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:50,850
help others and get to know others

421
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:53,070
better and the fact that like processing

422
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:55,500
emotions is good like having good

423
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:57,540
insight and being a good listener and

424
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:00,779
understanding and wanting to know more

425
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:02,990
about feelings is good and it's good for

426
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:06,570
me because I'm human and humans have

427
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:10,770
feelings and it's good to talk about it

428
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:13,290
was like psychology gave me like a new

429
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:16,080
language that I feel like all my life I

430
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:19,290
was just screaming to try to understand

431
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:21,690
and try to put into words my experiences

432
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:23,550
and it was like an enlightening

433
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:26,460
experience when I started to learn more

434
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:27,990
about psychology number six what is your

435
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:30,420
current profession and how did you

436
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:32,460
decide to pursue this career path this

437
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:34,860
was while I was still at my last job but

438
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:36,360
I said I make I am a clinical team lead

439
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,490
therapist at a substance abuse

440
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,650
outpatient program after setting

441
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:42,660
undergrad I knew I wanted to get into a

442
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:44,640
field where I could have more human

443
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,350
interactions and help people and I

444
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,850
actually didn't know about the field of

445
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:51,180
Social Work until senior year of college

446
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:53,430
I knew I wanted to do like clinical

447
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:56,640
psychotherapy I cared a lot about a lot

448
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:58,320
of social justice and advocacy and when

449
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,779
I learn more about Social Work and like

450
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,580
the ethics of Social Work and how it's

451
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:05,250
so client centered and where it's so

452
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:07,140
empowering for the client I really felt

453
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,910
like this was the right field for me we

454
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,300
know that you have a successful YouTube

455
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,890
channel

456
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,569
what was your initiative for starting

457
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:14,309
this YouTube channel you know this isn't

458
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:16,110
my first YouTube channel actually in

459
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:17,939
high school I had a YouTube channel for

460
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:20,130
song covers because I like to sing it's

461
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:21,660
deleted now so don't try to look for it

462
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:23,490
the second time around when I started

463
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:27,120
this YouTube channel I think it was in

464
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:28,770
2014 when I started uploading like my

465
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,690
face onto YouTube

466
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:32,670
I wanted a channel where I held

467
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:35,190
discussions on mental health and social

468
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:37,110
justice topics because I couldn't find a

469
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:39,390
lot of those on YouTube and maybe

470
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:41,370
YouTube isn't the place for those kinds

471
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:43,590
of serious discussions sometimes when I

472
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:45,360
have controversial videos controversial

473
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:48,300
my videos they aren't that controversial

474
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,980
but a lot of people are like why did you

475
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,910
post this people come to YouTube for

476
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,190
entertainment and

477
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:55,530
I understand that but my mission is if

478
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:57,750
they can stop by one of my videos and

479
00:17:55,530 --> 00:18:00,960
get some tips on how to deal with their

480
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:03,270
anxiety or if they've been depressed and

481
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,430
they've been watching 20 hours of cat

482
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:07,800
videos to deal with it but if they come

483
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:09,030
across on my videos on you know letting

484
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,250
them know that it's okay to feel

485
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:13,350
depressed and if they get something

486
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:15,360
positive out of my videos I could help

487
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:16,380
them with their mental health that is

488
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,720
amazing

489
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:20,340
so it's like a gateway in a way and what

490
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,170
I make like fashion videos and vlogs

491
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:24,660
like not only are those fun for me

492
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:26,820
creatively but I make those videos

493
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:28,860
because I understand that they there's a

494
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:31,590
lot of them so they get recommended more

495
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:33,270
so they get a lot more views so which

496
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:34,980
means that other people will come to my

497
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:36,960
channel and when they click on my

498
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,820
channel I want them to see that like

499
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,740
this channel has other videos that could

500
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:43,260
potentially help me and it means so much

501
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:46,290
to me that I can just sit down and make

502
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:48,000
these videos and talk and it could make

503
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:52,410
someone's day a little bit better it

504
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,690
it's so powerful and just reminds me

505
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:57,300
that this isn't just a job for me this

506
00:18:54,690 --> 00:19:00,450
is a joy and this is such a passion of

507
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:02,700
mine to talk about these topics and yeah

508
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:04,500
that's why I do my YouTube so I can

509
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,000
connect with you guys who I could

510
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,430
hopefully help out even just a little

511
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,960
bit number 8 are there any changes in

512
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:12,450
people's perceptions of mental wellness

513
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:14,100
that you hope to see in our Asian

514
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:15,330
community I'm gonna read this one too

515
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,190
just because it's really important and

516
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:20,040
took me a while to word it succinctly

517
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:21,810
I am hoping for more safe discussions on

518
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:24,000
mental health in our Asian community I

519
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:26,220
emphasize safe because of the strong

520
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,690
negative stigma that exists there are so

521
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:29,670
many Asian Americans who suffer in

522
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:31,350
silence and I envision a future where we

523
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:33,570
can begin to explore and embrace

524
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:35,340
conversations on dealing with mental

525
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:37,560
illness and grappling with asking for

526
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:39,480
help when you say vision I find myself

527
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,950
seeing a physical vision of a group of

528
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,990
Asian Americans sitting in a room

529
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:46,230
together Asian Americans who are young

530
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:48,000
old members of the LGBTQ community abled

531
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:49,530
and disabled and everyone else sitting

532
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,630
in a room together sharing their

533
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:54,240
thoughts feelings and experiences and

534
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:56,190
crying laughing experiencing anger and

535
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,440
all of the range of emotions because

536
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:59,940
they can and they want to I work hard

537
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,770
every day and keep speaking up as a

538
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,460
mental wellness advocate to work towards

539
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:06,450
such Empire

540
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:08,730
some day I totally even now have those

541
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:10,650
interactions with people in my community

542
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:12,420
where they ask me what do you do for

543
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:18,000
work and I tell them I'm a therapist and

544
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:19,560
there's always like a dot dot dot just

545
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,180
because and you know there's probably

546
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:24,000
lots of layers to that as well depending

547
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:26,130
on who I'm talking to but I want to be

548
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,870
able to have these conversations that

549
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:29,430
I'm having with you right now the camera

550
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:31,380
and see my camera died because this is

551
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:33,630
too long but what was I saying

552
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:35,310
that's what I want I want to be able to

553
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:37,590
have these candid conversations with

554
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:39,510
people in my community whether it's my

555
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:41,700
friends my asian-american friends

556
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:44,400
whether it's my asian-american family

557
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:47,880
that's that's a whole nother mountain to

558
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,260
climb but you know I want it that's my

559
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,570
vision that's what I work hard for

560
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:54,810
that's why I make these videos and do my

561
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:56,250
work and why I speak up that's my that's

562
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:58,290
what I want number nine

563
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:00,420
any advice for East Asian peers who are

564
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:02,940
struggling with self identity or mental

565
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:05,610
challenges my answer was remember that

566
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:08,250
you are not alone while we are at times

567
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:10,140
grossly underrepresented in mainstream

568
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:13,020
conversations on mental health and

569
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:15,060
mental illness we exist like we're here

570
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:16,800
I'm feared and I know for a fact I've

571
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:18,900
spoken to a few of you a lot of you and

572
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:21,540
you are there you exist and it's

573
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:23,550
important to not isolate and support

574
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:25,860
ourselves and support circles whether

575
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:28,800
it's friends campus counseling centers

576
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:31,650
entities like Project T I want to tell

577
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:33,660
everyone who may identify with me in my

578
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:35,670
situation in this conversation in any

579
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:38,250
way that you're not alone your story

580
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:40,080
whatever your story may be is essential

581
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:43,260
to this movement of raising awareness

582
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:45,510
and combating negative stigma in our

583
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:47,940
Asian communities like your story can

584
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:49,530
change lives and that's powerful when

585
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:51,630
those are the answers that I gave to

586
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:53,970
project T for my interview but I wanted

587
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:55,620
to finish off this video by talking a

588
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:57,450
little bit about what it's like for me

589
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,980
being korean-american and what it's been

590
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:01,470
like for me being a mental health

591
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:04,170
provider and certain words that came up

592
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:06,480
for me isolation under representation

593
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:09,360
and complacency and let me dive into

594
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,920
those real quick and isolation I feel

595
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,680
like being in this path for me for the

596
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:17,370
past when did I really like commit

597
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:19,320
this it's like 2014 2015 because before

598
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:22,440
2014 I was kind of like a dead person on

599
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:24,480
the inside and 2014 is when like my this

600
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:28,290
journey of self-discovery really started

601
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:30,300
so for the past six years I'd say it's a

602
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:32,070
pretty lonely road I'll say that I have

603
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:33,870
really amazing friends really amazing

604
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:35,820
family but specifically when it comes to

605
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:38,790
age in America mental health and social

606
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:41,910
justice in these topics it's been it's

607
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:43,140
been kind of a lonely road and a lot a

608
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:45,450
lot of the times that's been really hard

609
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:48,060
for me because it's hard to talk to my

610
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:49,790
family about the job that I do because I

611
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:53,160
know it makes them uncomfortable and

612
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:54,840
because I know more now about why I like

613
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:57,930
the cultural implications of the things

614
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:59,370
that I'm talking about I understand but

615
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:01,470
it doesn't mean that it makes it any

616
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:03,330
easier on me who was a mental health

617
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:06,000
professional but because of the

618
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:07,950
isolation I think I've really been

619
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,700
training and doing a lot of advocacy

620
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:13,800
speaking up more you know agreeing to do

621
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,650
these kinds of interviews and putting it

622
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:19,770
out there I am an Asian American

623
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:22,260
therapist I am here we are important

624
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:25,020
putting it out there speaking up

625
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:28,020
visibility trying to find a community in

626
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:30,720
that sense and trying to it's it's an

627
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:33,090
ongoing process you know there it's hard

628
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,700
to find community when there is such

629
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:36,930
there's not many people out there and

630
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:39,300
that goes into the second one which is

631
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:40,620
under-representation Asian Americans

632
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:42,930
just in general are underrepresented

633
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:44,390
when it comes to the conversations on

634
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:46,830
mental health and mental illness

635
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:48,990
treatment and not only in the sense of

636
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:51,390
like patients there's not that many

637
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:54,030
patients because many Asians it's hard

638
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:55,140
for them to seek help or they a lot of

639
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:57,750
them they don't even understand that

640
00:23:55,140 --> 00:24:00,120
this kind of help exists I had a Korean

641
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:02,490
client like my last month of work and I

642
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:04,050
wanted to work with her so badly but I

643
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:06,030
knew I was leaving so that won't be good

644
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:07,830
for her but I had to explain to her what

645
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:09,720
therapy was and she was like why would I

646
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:11,820
do that I'm on medicine and like there's

647
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:14,270
so much like countertransference or as a

648
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:18,990
girl I feel you I know what you mean

649
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:20,700
because so much of like Asians so much

650
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:22,200
of the asian community of understanding

651
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:24,030
mental illnesses there is no

652
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,280
understanding there's a you're sick

653
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:27,299
here's medicine take it you'll be fine

654
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,429
like when someone

655
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:31,379
answer you wouldn't be like oh you have

656
00:24:29,429 --> 00:24:32,700
cancer okay take medicine you'll be fine

657
00:24:31,379 --> 00:24:35,159
don't talk about it anymore

658
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:38,460
no like there is an outpouring of love

659
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:41,210
and the community and like solidarity oh

660
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:43,619
yes when you hear that someone is

661
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:46,110
schizophrenic you know or has some sort

662
00:24:43,619 --> 00:24:49,590
of is bipolar borderline there's all of

663
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:51,539
these the trigger labels that make

664
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:55,259
people treat others in ways that are not

665
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:56,999
fair and are not accurate and add with

666
00:24:55,259 --> 00:24:59,159
that already and like add on the layer

667
00:24:56,999 --> 00:25:01,889
like the cultural stigma and generations

668
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:03,690
of that it's just there's a lot of

669
00:25:01,889 --> 00:25:06,090
under-representation of us when it comes

670
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:08,669
to patients but also in the field of

671
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:11,220
mental health and interestingly from

672
00:25:08,669 --> 00:25:12,480
what I noticed in undergrad and also in

673
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:15,570
Social Work school and also working

674
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:18,239
there are more Chinese Americans I

675
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:21,119
realize more chinese-american providers

676
00:25:18,239 --> 00:25:22,350
not that many korean-american providers

677
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:24,989
and I don't know what that's about but

678
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:26,489
it's fascinating and obviously I want to

679
00:25:24,989 --> 00:25:28,889
do more research and figure that stuff

680
00:25:26,489 --> 00:25:32,279
out because being korean-american I

681
00:25:28,889 --> 00:25:35,220
obviously have like a very strong desire

682
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:37,649
and will and passion to help my

683
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:39,869
community as well and there's not that

684
00:25:37,649 --> 00:25:41,669
many korean-american providers out there

685
00:25:39,869 --> 00:25:43,169
and the way I deal with the

686
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:44,609
under-representation I think is I

687
00:25:43,169 --> 00:25:47,820
represent myself

688
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:49,799
I don't quit I go to conferences I sign

689
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:53,159
up for trainings I know I'm the only

690
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:55,350
Asian American they're like 95% of the

691
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:59,100
time if there's like one other Asian oh

692
00:25:55,350 --> 00:26:01,049
my hey hey what's up and I try to engage

693
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:02,460
with them share numbers like follow each

694
00:26:01,049 --> 00:26:04,619
other on LinkedIn do that kind of

695
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:07,169
networking stuff but the networking is

696
00:26:04,619 --> 00:26:10,830
like not important it's the fact that I

697
00:26:07,169 --> 00:26:12,779
see you you see me we're here

698
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:14,039
representing and there's kind of like a

699
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:16,529
yes

700
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:19,440
like you know I'm representing my people

701
00:26:16,529 --> 00:26:22,350
and I'm gonna keep doing this and this

702
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:25,259
is a statement in itself that we exist

703
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:27,659
and thirdly was complacency I believe

704
00:26:25,259 --> 00:26:30,210
and this is just something I've come

705
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:33,210
across a lot in school where everyone

706
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:36,480
seems to a lot of people seem to know

707
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:38,559
that Asians are underrepresented both in

708
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:41,799
both sides where the clients

709
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:43,419
patience and like providers especially

710
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:45,279
mental health there's a lot of Asian

711
00:26:43,419 --> 00:26:48,220
doctors that's for sure but mental

712
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:50,409
health providers but I come to wonder

713
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:52,679
what's being done about that I've read a

714
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:55,059
lot of journals about you know like

715
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:56,769
engage them there's some articles that

716
00:26:55,059 --> 00:27:00,450
were like engage them but don't talk

717
00:26:56,769 --> 00:27:03,340
about like the big words mental health

718
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:05,230
I'll keep them coming by doing case

719
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:06,879
management helping them with practical

720
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:08,620
things and then eventually like you'll

721
00:27:06,879 --> 00:27:10,600
work on your rapport and they'll start

722
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:13,450
to trust you more so there are papers

723
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:15,460
out there but it's like I feel like so

724
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:18,480
much more can be done outreach is so

725
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:21,909
important in this field outreach and

726
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:24,279
engaging and using words and terms that

727
00:27:21,909 --> 00:27:26,289
are friendly and understandable to asian

728
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:28,330
communities as a provider there have

729
00:27:26,289 --> 00:27:30,639
been times where I was like it is what

730
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:32,889
it is there's like no one that looks

731
00:27:30,639 --> 00:27:34,299
like me is in this field oh oh she came

732
00:27:32,889 --> 00:27:35,590
for the intake but didn't show up for

733
00:27:34,299 --> 00:27:38,110
the therapy session

734
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:40,899
oh she's Asian okay it makes sense it's

735
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:42,639
like no no it shouldn't end there it

736
00:27:40,899 --> 00:27:45,279
makes sense understanding the numbers of

737
00:27:42,639 --> 00:27:47,259
Statistics that many Asians don't follow

738
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:49,179
up and there's a lot of different

739
00:27:47,259 --> 00:27:49,899
reasons for that however what's being

740
00:27:49,179 --> 00:27:53,679
done about it

741
00:27:49,899 --> 00:27:55,059
and I myself have my personal mission of

742
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:58,899
what I'm serving my clients and my

743
00:27:55,059 --> 00:28:00,580
agency is that I offer my opinion and

744
00:27:58,899 --> 00:28:02,230
two cents all the time especially when

745
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:03,970
it comes to working with Asian clients

746
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:05,769
and a lot of times it's hard for

747
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:07,659
minorities because we are expected to

748
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:09,820
represent ourselves in every situation

749
00:28:07,659 --> 00:28:13,059
and like that's a lot of pressure on one

750
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:14,710
person and I get that but I make it my

751
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:17,470
mission to represent myself and my

752
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:19,450
people in this field because who else is

753
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:21,850
gonna do it if I don't so if I have a

754
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:23,830
client who's Asian and who doesn't want

755
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:25,480
to do group therapy but like it's better

756
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:27,460
for their substance use treatment that

757
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:29,590
they do group therapy I have advocated

758
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:32,139
for those clients saying hey you know

759
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:34,659
because this person is Asian you know

760
00:28:32,139 --> 00:28:36,100
talking about their substance use issues

761
00:28:34,659 --> 00:28:37,809
with one person is already hard enough

762
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:39,759
but in a group setting that's really

763
00:28:37,809 --> 00:28:41,830
really kind of unheard of in our culture

764
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:43,600
and I'm not saying that I like put my

765
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:44,679
experience on that person but it's kind

766
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,659
of like putting it when we have like

767
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:48,129
kind of clinical meetings it's kind of

768
00:28:46,659 --> 00:28:49,560
like putting it out there by the way

769
00:28:48,129 --> 00:28:51,750
don't forget

770
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:54,390
this person is asian asian american this

771
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:56,340
person's culture is very against what

772
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:59,040
we're all doing here and we want to be

773
00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:01,200
as extra sensitive and caring and

774
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,910
accommodating to this person to help

775
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,170
them the best because if we lose them we

776
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:05,460
can't help them that's what I've been

777
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:07,040
experiencing and seeing a lot of

778
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:10,140
isolation under-representation

779
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:12,780
complacency and as you can see it roused

780
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:14,430
me up because yeah it gets me down

781
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:18,420
sometimes it's hard it's a lonely road

782
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:20,910
like I said however I exist other Asian

783
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:23,400
providers exist like I said I see them

784
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:25,770
across serve and I'm like hey I see you

785
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:27,810

793
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:49,530
world that we exist so yeah this video

00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:51,510
is so long I apologize that it was such

795
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:54,570
an important video I brought you guys

796
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:57,120
along on a journey of where I'm from how

797
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:59,550
I grew up how my identity and my

798
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,260
cultural identity my mental health has

799
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:03,750
been affected throughout the years of my

800
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:05,580
life and how that has led ultimately to

801
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:08,040
where I am I'm sitting today being an

802
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:09,870
Asian American mental health provider I

803
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,550
kind of gave you more of an insight into

804
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:14,010
what that's been like for me the

805
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:17,040
challenges but clearly the rewards of it

806
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:19,740
all and just what I do on my channel I

807
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:22,500
