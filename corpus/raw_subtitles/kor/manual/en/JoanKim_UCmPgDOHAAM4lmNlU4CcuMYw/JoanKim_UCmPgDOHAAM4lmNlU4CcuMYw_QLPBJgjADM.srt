00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,060
Hi, everyone welcome back to my channel!

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,940
Today I will be filming a Q&A

3
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:05,660
It's been a while since I filmed one of these

4
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,580
And I received a lot of questions on Instagram

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,720
So I'm gonna try my best to answer as many as I can today, so

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,860
Let's get started!

7
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,720
I'm actually in LA right now

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,040
And Abe is actually here as well

9
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,540
he's actually helping me film this, so

10
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,600
If you hear his voice, it's Abe

11
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,340
I don't make the list anymore

12
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,400
Mainly because I don't want to get disappointed

13
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,920
when I don't fulfill them

14
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,680
but one of the things I wanted to do this year

15
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,540
was to visit a country that I haven't been to

16
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,840
And I already did that

17
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,880
I went to Spain,

18
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,180
and then I'm gonna to Philippines, and

19
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:46,080
I don't know, I wanna travel as much as I can

20
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,280
before I settle down

21
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,980
but I don't even know when I'm going to settle down

22
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,500
... I don't know

23
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,960
I'm finally going

24
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,700
in the first weekend of May with Christine!

25
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,700
We're going to Boracay

26
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:04,840
Israel

27
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,740
Eventually, I want to move back to California and

28
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,180
that transition is probably going to take a few years

29
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,960
You don't have to drive

30
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,680
and everything can get delivered to you

31
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,200
everything and anything can get delivered to you

32
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,980
I'm a full time YouTuber and

33
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,940
I also talk on the radio!

34
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,920
Are you not doing Joanday vlogs anymore?

35
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,940
I kinda answered this answer in my video with Charlotte

36
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,220
And I'm taking a break

37
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:41,400
I am thinking of a way to start Joanday again

38
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm still in the process of thinking...

39
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,440
Abe: Uhh... you can just watch my vlogs

40
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,640
ehe Abesfigures!

41
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,120
Abe: There you go! *chuckles*

42
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:55,160
What is your favourite thing about having all of the Joanday vlogs to look back on

43
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,740
Their memories! And

44
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,320
I documented them and I could go back and watch them and

45
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,280
relive that moment

46
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,800
They're extensions!

47
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,640
I have a video dedicated to my hair extensions so

48
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,220
click up there to watch!

49
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,980
I got a lot of questions about products

50
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,980
so I'm going to answer them all right now

51
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,000
and I'll link it for you guys in the description box!

52
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,560
Currently, I love MAC 'Chilli'

53
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,260
I love Le Labo Santal 33

54
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,420
YesStyle!

55
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,280
Rifle Paper!

56
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,100
Reformation

57
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,820
For skincare I really like Drunk Elephant and

58
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,580
for Make Up I love Hourglass

59
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:46,340
Currently I'm using 3CE in 'Smoother'

60
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,660
Abe do you wanna just throw them out?

61
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,160
Abe: Oh yeah so the MVP cream..

62
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,280
Centella Blemish Cream...

63
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,380
Abe: The Fire Lotion

64
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,300
What Lotion... the Ph?

65
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:56,860
Abe: The Birch Sap lotion...

66
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,030
Oh the Birch Sap! Fire? *chuckles*

67
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:58,580
Abe: And also...

68
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,460
Abe: that Ceramide Cream I've been really into these days..

69
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,475
Oh really??

70
00:03:02,475 --> 00:03:03,860
Abe: And.. um..

71
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,440
Abe: of course the patches! That's like a no-brainer and

72
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,600
Abe: their cleansers are fire too, so

73
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,260
Okay

74
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,500
My personal favourite would have to be the patches

75
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,260
I love the patches and the Snail Essence because

76
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,740
that actually help me fade a lot of my shingles scar on my leg

77
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,940
I know I used it on my leg! *Abe laughs*

78
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,040
But I was like,

79
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,300
"It has to help fade everything on my body"

80
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,760
So I tried it out and I love the Snail Essence

81
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,440
Who are the YouTubers you like to watch?

82
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,800

83
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,720
Abe is like *pointing at himself*

84
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,820
Um, I really like David Dobrik yeah

85
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,740
Abe: you know like, PewDiePie?

86
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,700
You like PewDiePie

87
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,560
Abe: I love him

88
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,080
I love David Dobrik because he does the vlogs

89
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:44,960
Abe: Oh yeah

90
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,960
and those are vlogs that I can never do cause

91
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,600
he's just wild. You've watched his vlogs, right?

92
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,760
Abe: This means that you have to do

93
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,960
No! People are gonna get hurt!

94
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,540
Abe do you want to answer this?

95
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:02,060
Abe: What kind of question is that makes question?

96
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,580
Are you hyped for Endgame?

97
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,880
Did you buy your tickets yet?

98
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,520
Abe: Of course I did!

99
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,900
Who you're going to watch it with?

100
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:08,660
Abe: Dad *laughs* (LOL)

101
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,180
Are you gonna vlog it??

102
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,380
You should vlog it!

103
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,000
Abe: I might

104
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,140
You might vlog? Watching Endgame with dad?

105
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,280
Abe: Well I might be vlog my dad's reaction like he would insecure

106
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:17,880
Fun fact!

107
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,780
You can't film in there tho?

108
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,780
Abe: No, but I'm gonna ask him questions

109
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,520
Fun fact I'm gonna see Endgame before Abe

110
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,760
Because it releases in Korea before America!

111
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,940
Um I got a lot of questions about marriage

112
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,500
I don't plan on getting married anytime soon but

113
00:04:35,515 --> 00:04:38,375
if the right person comes into my life

114
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,700
then maybe I'll get married!

115
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,100
What is the best things that happened to you during the past week?

116
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,480
Since I'm in LA I've been meeting up with a lot of my friends and

117
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,600
catching up with them so I guess that has been the biggest highlight

118
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,340
and Abe just got to LA so

119
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,640
He doesn't want to be in the video cause

120
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,500
looks like he just got off the plane

121
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,440
Abe: No seriously.. Like I

122
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,100
It's not a good sight!

123
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,040
Not that he's a good sight! ( LMAO YOU TWO )

124
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,620
Abe: Dude yeah yeah I was about to say that!

125
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,080
Subscribe to Abesfigures!

126
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,680
2002 World Cup!

127
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,300
I really like 'Kick It'

128
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,040
Spiderman, because he's a nerd

129
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,140
but he's also very powerful and

130
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,080
when it comes to superheroes

131
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,740
I really like characters with a brain, so

132
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:30,240
I love Iron Man, Hulk, Rocket Racoon

133
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,380
and who else who's really smart? Abe?

134
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,380
Abe: Doctor Doom..

135
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,920
Doctor Strange!

136
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,380
This might sound sad to you but

137
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,480
I never been in love, so

138
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,060
I don't know

139
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,760
Abe how do you deal with heartbreak?

140
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,320
He's just cries for a week

141
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,220
Abe: *argues in the back*

142
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,040
Abe.. Abe *chuckles*

143
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,720
Abe is so emotional

144
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,300
It's annoying!

145
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,320
Oh my God!

146
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,680
He does! And he gets over it so quickly

147
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,240
Abe is a serial dater. I've never seen him single.

148
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,480
I've never seen him single! Maybe for like two weeks

149
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,880
And he's like "I'm lonely."

150
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,060
Abe: This is your Q&A!

151
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,920
Roasting Abe!

152
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,800
Oh my gosh, Okay last question

153
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,700
My favourite scene is when Thor has like

154
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,760
the magnificent comeback.

155
00:06:22,765 --> 00:06:23,765
With his new hammer

156
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,340
and he's like... yelling

157
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,680
"Bring me Thanos."

158
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,480
Is it "Bring me Thanos" ?

159
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,000
Abe: Yes

160
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,160
Yeah, I watched that scene like so many times on replay

161
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,180
So good

162
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,980

00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,920
