00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:06,089
Hi everyone welcome back to my channel and in today's video

2
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:10,109
I will be sharing with you guys something that I have been wanting to share on my channel

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,280
And it's about my life as a Korean American so

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,039
Amy actually tagged me to do the Asian American tag

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,369
but I wanted to do it a little differently by sharing with you guys my

6
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:26,310
Background story first before getting into those details, so I'm gonna start my story now

7
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:31,620
So if you didn't know I was born and raised in Los Angeles, California

8
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,289
and when I was about three and when my brother was born

9
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,430
our family we moved to South Korea because my

10
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,649
Grandpa was diagnosed with cancer and my parents wanted us to spend time with him

11
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:48,299
And I remember going to preschool, in Korea

12
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,789
And you know I just grew up like learning how to speak Korean and that's all I knew

13
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:59,069
But then when I was five I moved back, and then I started attending school

14
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:04,589
and I was the only Asian in my school so

15
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:10,889
Obviously I looked very different, and I didn't know the language so I mean as a kid

16
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,699
I'm kind of like very similar to what I am now

17
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:20,429
I'm very extroverted, and I love meeting new people so I didn't really have a problem with making friends

18
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:25,320
But of course there was that language barrier, but I don't really remember like traumatic

19
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,419
Experiences like from kindergarten at all so in first grade

20
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,300
That's when I kind of realized that I was different because during reading time

21
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:42,080
I was always asked to you know come out of the room and then go to another classroom and

22
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:47,130
Do ESL courses with another teacher and you know that was very helpful for me

23
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:52,740
But I also hated it because I felt very different from my classmates, and they would always be like oh

24
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,169
It's like 11 o'clock, its time for you to leave the classroom

25
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,520
so that actually motivated me to study harder and

26
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,400
Actually, I'll be going into details of this later

27
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,980
But every time people pointed out that I was different or like a certain stereotype

28
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,200
I would always work extra hard

29
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:15,800
just so that I would no longer be in ESL and that I could get better grades and things like that so

30
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,169
Yeah in first grade I had to deal with

31
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:23,899
Feeling different because I would always have to step out of the classroom for those ESL courses

32
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:31,320
and then I also remember a time when my like classmates they were looking through a magazine and

33
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,760
It was a Britney Spears magazine

34
00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:39,859
and I remember not knowing who she was and my classmates made fun of me for not knowing who she was and

35
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,410
Like I grew up liking kpop

36
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:45,800
So I'm a very OG kpop fan

37
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,249
like I listened to it back when Fin.K.L was around Baby VOX

38
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,530
GOD, Boa, Jang Nara like those were like

39
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:57,120
Those are my idols

40
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,789
so for them to hate on me for

41
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:03,019
Not knowing who Britney Spears was like that was really sad on my end

42
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:08,089
but I remember like going to like Ralph's and Albertsons just to study the

43
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,997
celebrities because I had no idea who any of them were

44
00:03:11,997 --> 00:03:13,639
so 2nd grade comes around and

45
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:18,379
A Korean moved to our district, and I was like whoa that's really cool

46
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:19,920
And I remember teachers

47
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,380
Asking me to come out of the classroom

48
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:25,339
Just to help her because I knew how to speak both English and Korean now

49
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:31,880
So I felt really good about doing that because for the first time I felt a sense of worth

50
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,489
Because now people were praising me for

51
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,040
knowing Korean and Korean culture

52
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:42,349
So I remember for like a whole year the teachers would always let me sit with this girl

53
00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:46,129
And I would always translate for her help her do her work and things like that

54
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:54,380
but then like later um I realized that she didn't want to do anything Korean anymore so I

55
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,120
kind of felt

56
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,940
How do I explain this

57
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:02,779
so I remember this girl kind of avoiding me because she just didn't want to practice Korean anymore

58
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,049
And I remember coming back home, and I told my brother

59
00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:10,189
I was like Abe from now on we're gonna only speak English at home

60
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:13,429
And we started doing that to our parents as well

61
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:18,919
And I remember my mom feeling so sad afterwards because if you think about it now

62
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:25,129
if I think about it now my parents both sacrificed their comfortable life in Korea

63
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:30,229
To move to America for me and my brother and even after we moved

64
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,780
We still came back after

65
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,660
Two years of living in Korea because my parents wanted us to have an education in America

66
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:45,559
so I felt terrible about that and I also got in trouble for trying to only speak English at home and then after that I

67
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:50,810
Was like you know what, I'm just gonna embrace Korean and at home it will just be Korean and outside of it

68
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:54,139
I will just speak English so I always kept it

69
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,559
Like I never shared this information with my friends at school

70
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:02,020
Just because I don't know I was always embarrassed about being Korean

71
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,380
so there's a little bit of my foundation now

72
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,079
I'm going to answer some questions from the asian-american tag

73
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,210
I'm korean-american

74
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,030
My parents were both born in Seoul South Korea

75
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:15,570
And then they moved to America and then I was born

76
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:21,689
So I guess I would be 1.5 generation or second generation my uncle always tells me of second generation

77
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,120
But I always feel like I am 1.5

78
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:28,288
I kind of shared this in my background story

79
00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:33,179
But definitely when my classmates were flipping through the magazine and talking about Britney Spears

80
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:40,900
I knew there was something different about that and also none of my classmates looked like me we had different eyes we had different hair colors and

81
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,480
Yeah, I knew for a fact that I was different, but also

82
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:50,279
When we all started to learn about Asian culture in history class I remember people were like Oh

83
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:56,069
What kind of Asian were you again were you Chinese or Japanese and when I would answer I'm Korean no one knew

84
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,279
What Korea was and I was like oh

85
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:04,619
That's so strange like I'm Korean and I know the language and the music and everything

86
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:06,749
But I felt kind of different there

87
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,739
and then when we learned about Korea people would ask me are you north or south and

88
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,699
actually

89
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:16,139
I went back home and asked my mom like am I north or in my south korean and my mom

90
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,500
Answered that I am South Korean because both my parents were born in Seoul South Korea, but later

91
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:29,519
I also learned that my grandpa like one of my grandparents he is from North Korea, and then I got to learn more about

92
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,250
his story and

93
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,319
His testimony things like that

94
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,360
Even as a child

95
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:44,889
I was always very proud to be Korean and I remember trying to share with my classmates who Boa was

96
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:52,419
But of course I did mention in my background story where I did want to try to reject it, but I respected my parents

97
00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:56,529
Too much to reject my Korean heritage, so I was very proud about it

98
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,320
This definitely changed throughout the years so

99
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,320
In elementary, junior high and high school the stereotype was

100
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:11,600
Asians are smart so I knew for a fact that I wasn't born with the brains my brother is actually

101
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,020
really really intelligent

102
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:19,249
And I just kind of like got the grades that I needed and Abe just went like above and beyond

103
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,550
But I definitely knew I wasn't like smart compared to my brother

104
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:26,180
But because all of my classmates kept telling me that Asians are smart

105
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,469
I would work extra hard

106
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:32,090
Like I mentioned before I was the first child in my family

107
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,779
Like I was the first born my parents were both from Korea

108
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:40,190
They went to college in Korea, and they didn't really like they weren't too strict with me

109
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:46,700
but I feel like they became strict with my brother because I would be like no mom dad Abe has to do this this and that

110
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,270
so my brother always jokes around saying that I am his second mother

111
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:54,409
But yeah one of the stereotypes that I did struggle with was like Asians are smart

112
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:58,279
but that actually motivated me to take the classes that I took and

113
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:02,419
Get the grades that I got when I went to college at UC Berkeley

114
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,869
That's when I met the most Asians so like I mentioned before

115
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,740
I went to a school where I was the only Asian in the beginning

116
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:15,289
And then I think I can count like how many Asians attended my school with my hands

117
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:22,520
Like in elementary school, and then it like obviously grew the Asian community grew in our neighborhood

118
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,210
but in college

119
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:27,660
I never met so many Korean Americans

120
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:32,180
Koreans like Asians overall and I didn't really feel a

121
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,100
Stereotype because we were all the same

122
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:41,860
But then when I moved to Korea there was another stereotype that I had to deal with which is being korean-american

123
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:45,590
How do I explain this kind of situation?

124
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:51,979
People would kind of assume that I had a lot of money for speaking English, but that was definitely not the case

125
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:58,879
And then some people would just kind of point out that like oh, I'm being very ignorant even though

126
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,499
I knew Korean so like I remember like my friend and I we were eating at this restaurant

127
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,470
And like the ladies right next to us. We were like oh my gosh

128
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,520
She's so Korean. She looks Korean, but she's not speaking any Korean

129
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:15,329
An that's like a shameful thing, but then when I was paying for the food

130
00:09:15,329 --> 00:09:17,549
I would speak in like Korean and they were like whoa

131
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,300
So like I always felt like I had to prove myself that like oh

132
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,439
I really try my best to learn both of the cultures so

133
00:09:26,319 --> 00:09:28,149
Yeah

134
00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:33,268
Yes, I can and I'm nowhere where I want to be because I didn't go to school here

135
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:35,578
But I can read speak and write Korean

136
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,480
Growing up I

137
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:47,370
Learned how to be an adult a lot quicker than most because my parents needed help

138
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,779
Translating documents and every time they needed to call like

139
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:56,820
I don't know like an electric bill company or a gas company

140
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,760
I had to do it with them sitting right next to me so I

141
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:05,820
Remember like in the beginning. I liked doing it, but then I also got angry every time

142
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,610
I had to do this

143
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:10,289
But you know like that kind of got me closer to my mom

144
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:16,760
Because you know she was dealing with all the finances and things like that so I think growing up

145
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:21,620
Korean-american like my relationship with my like parents. It was always like a close one

146
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:29,819
I am very proud of being korean-american and I was always proud of being korean-american. I love the food

147
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,470
I love the music

148
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:34,889
I love the films are like you guys watch Joan Day

149
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:41,580
And this is actually one of like my biggest goals is to share Korea in a more realistic view

150
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,700
Definitely enjoying best of both worlds

151
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:51,729
in America there are diners and in Korea there are snack carts and I identify with both

152
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:55,900
Both has to do with food actually, but you get what I'm trying to say here

153
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,560
So that was my story about growing up

154
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,880
korean-american

155
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:04,300
and of course I answered the questions that Amy created for the asian-american tag

156
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,840
if you guys

157
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,899
identify with any of this please share your

158
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:11,660
Stories in the comment section below because I would love to read about it

159
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,479
if you guys enjoyed the sit-down chat

00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,700
please give this video a thumbs up and

161

Here are the people that I tagged to do this Asian American tag.

162
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:23,160
I would love to watch my friends share their experiences

163
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,500
so bug them about it too.

164
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,160
