1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,560
good morning my frens

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,060
it's actually noon

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:06,380
hello my frens it's nina

4
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,180
and i am currently bare-faced

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,700
as you can tell by the title of this video

6
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,520
i am doing a get ready with me

7
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,100
i'm going to do my makeup with you guys because

8
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,700
i'm going to be talking about a certain topic

9
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,280
and i need to be doing stuff with my hands

10
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,820
so i'm doing my makeup

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,360
so i was sick for like 16 hours

12
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,040
i don't know what that was

13
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,460
i thought i was actually sick

14
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,680
i had a sore throat and all that

15
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,940
so i thought i was actually sick

16
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,380
and i was really shook

17
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,020
i thought i couldn't film a video

18
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,140
but i took one day to rest

19
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,280
then i'm fine now

20
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,520
i don't know what happened

21
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,420
that was a weird experience

22
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,740
but i'm okay for now

23
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,540
my throat is kind of okay

24
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,920
my nose, i might sound a little different

25
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,580
but that's fine

26
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,820
but as you can tell by the title of this video

27
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,380
i am going to be doing a get ready with me

28
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,240
as i talk about a certain topic

29
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,640
and i'm going to talk about a topic

30
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,960
that i feel like is interesting for you guys

31
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,140
and really just explains a lot about me

32
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,980
so i am korean american

33
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,780
i was born in america

34
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,220
but ethnically

35
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,820
my family is entirely from korea

36
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,780
i was the first one born in america

37
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,420
and so, korean american

38
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,120
i also don't know what that is

39
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,540
i don't know if it's a pimple or if it's a mosquito bite

40
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,120
whatever it is i haven't touched it

41
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,180
because i'm not dealing with it

42
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,020
i'm just gonna let it heal on its own

43
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:22,580
whatever it is

44
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,980
i don't know what you are but

45
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,380
you better leave soon

46
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,460
my makeup routine's actually really short

47
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,820
so i might finish my makeup

48
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,680
before i even finish talking about my story

49
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,720
so don't mind that

50
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,460
just, if you're actually getting ready

51
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,400
just keep going

52
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,460
anyway, so about being korean american

53
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,120
even though i'm the first to be born in america

54
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,820
i am a second generation korean american

55
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,960
now you're probably wondering how that works

56
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,460
well

57
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,360
so i was born in america

58
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,060
which makes me culturally very american

59
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,260
because that's all i've ever known

60
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,920
so my dad grew up in korea

61
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,960
he was born there

62
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,620
but then when he was 9 he moved to the US

63
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,460
with his family

64
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,280
with his mom and sister

65
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,120
and then started a life here

66
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,140
so he's considered the first generation or 1.5 generation

67
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,220
because he was the one to really first experience

68
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,320
transitioning to the american lifestyle

69
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,660
so his story is definitely very different from mine

70
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,720
because he was an actual immigrant

71
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,660
who came to the US and had to deal with a lot

72
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,280
anyway

73
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,980
he came here when he was still very young

74
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,620
so he was able to pick up the american culture

75
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,320
he had to pick it up really fast because

76
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,200
obviously he had to blend in with everyone else

77
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,640
and he was kind of like

78
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,900
he was the new kid, you know

79
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,960
there weren't a lot of asians where he grew up

80
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,380
i don't think there were really any koreans

81
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,760
or asians around him

82
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,060
but my dad definitely picked up

83
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,800
the american culture very fast

84
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,820
and he can speak english perfectly

85
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,840
he speaks both korean and english very perfectly

86
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,060
the first language he will speak is english

87
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,660
he'll speak korean if he has to

88
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,960
but otherwise he'll just speak in english

89
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,840
he spent literally most of his life in america

90
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,940
so he's definitely very americanized

91
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,940
now moving on from that, my mom

92
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,720
she came to the US for college so she spent

93
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,360
her entire adolescence and youth in korea

94
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,940
so culturally shes korean, very korean

95
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,740
i can't even tell if i finished my bb cream

96
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,220
the first language she will speak is korean

97
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,740
she's culturally very korean

98
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,660
she only really cares about korean

99
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,160
media and entertainment and culture and all that

100
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,200
so the next thing that happened was me being born

101
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:33,460
i was the first of my entire family to be born in the US

102
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,500
i was born in california, specifically the bay area

103
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,060
so i was fortunate enough to be

104
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,080
growing up in a place that is very diverse

105
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,800
we're very culturally diverse

106
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,840
so i never experienced being

107
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,280
the only asian or the only korean

108
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,440
i was literally surrounded by

109
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,520
a lot of asians and a lot of koreans

110
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,300
so i never felt different in that sense

111
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,240
where i grew up specifically in my city

112
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,920
there were a lot of asians so

113
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,380
i didn't experience that much racism

114
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,800
it was mostly chill because

115
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,500
if you were a racist, you would get attacked, so

116
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,480
so that was good

117
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,360
i didn't go to preschool

118
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,180
i spent most of my life [before school] at home

119
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,480
with my family

120
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,760
my mom my dad and my brother

121
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,040
my one brother because my other brother

122
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,700
was born 14 years after me so

123
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,480
it was first my older younger brother

124
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,240
so we were all just together

125
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,000
so my childhood before school

126
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,400
really was surrounded by my parents

127
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,320
and so i was exposed to both korean and english

128
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,720
which honestly got confusing

129
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,140
and really affected the way that i grew up

130
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,440
because i was having 2 languages

131
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,260
spoken to me at the same time

132
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,000
it did affect the way that i developed language-wise

133
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,600
so because i didn't go to preschool

134
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,540
i kind of missed out on that first year or two

135
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,460
of socializing with other kids

136
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,460
when i first went to kindergarten i actually didn't

137
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,280
understand the concept of going to school

138
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,960
i honestly didn't know what it was

139
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,180
so when my parents dropped me off on the first day

140
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,300
i remember leaving the classroom with them

141
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:07,940
because i was like

142
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,180
where are they going why are they leaving me here

143
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,020
so i was like following them but then my parents were like

144
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:12,880
nO you gotta stay here

145
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,380
and i was like

146
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,680
wHAT IS THIS

147
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,500
but yea so

148
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,400
kindergarten was my first exposure to other kids

149
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,640
i was always surrounded by, you know, like

150
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,740
my mom's friend's children

151
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,460
but other than that

152
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,280
this was the first time

153
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,400
i had to be in a social environment

154
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,480
it was terrifying

155
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,640
anyway moving on

156
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,120
when i was in school for the first few years

157
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,260
i experienced sort of being

158
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,700
behind most of my peers

159
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,920
and that was an obvious thing

160
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,120
because i didn't go to preschool

161
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,580
so i was already behind socially

162
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,400
but also

163
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,180
education-wise i was also behind my peers

164
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:43,820
because

165
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,500
i had both english and korean in my head

166
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,160
that i didn't pick up either language well

167
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,340
so i couldn't speak english that well

168
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,540
i obviously didn't know how to read that well

169
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,180
all that stuff so i was obviously behind my peers

170
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,740
and i was eventually put into an ELD [english language development] program

171
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,020
eVEN THOUGH

172
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:02,040
my first language was technically never korean

173
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,800
never, i never learned korean and then forgot it

174
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,180
like most people, no

175
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,160
it was never

176
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,180
my first language, or anything like that

177
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,460
so i was just literally developing slowly

178
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,200
just because

179
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:12,980
it was confusing

180
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,540
so i was put into ELD

181
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,340
which took a toll on my confidence in school

182
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,880
i already felt very behind my peers

183
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,960
and it was kind of just a feeling of

184
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,660
kind of, embarrassment

185
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,780
and shame that, you know,

186
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,580
why am i so behind already

187
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,580
and i was frickin, what, 5?

188
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,140
you know

189
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,480
give me a break

190
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,580
but i was put into ELD

191
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,740
but i left the program so fast too

192
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,560
it was my first year of being

193
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,400
in a social environment, so

194
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,000
i needed time to adjust

195
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,600
i had experiences in the past

196
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,140
where i would experience

197
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,220
kids being mean about me not being so smart

198
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,220
or not so quick

199
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,580
i actually had this one kid

200
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,960
make fun of me for being a slow reader

201
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,520
and i was like

202
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,800
looking back i was like

203
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,560
we're in first grade

204
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,260
what do you expect from me

205
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,080
but there were lots of moments like that

206
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,000
that just kind of

207
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,500
really affected my self-confidence

208
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,820
so growing up, for me, i became more and more distant

209
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,700
from my korean identity

210
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,400
just because as i got older

211
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,040
i was going through a lot of physical changes

212
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,820
and i just physically didn't look korean

213
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,860
or i didn't fit in that well

214
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,440
with my peers

215
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,620
i was tall

216
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,380
or at least bigger than most koreans

217
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,400
so i already felt this physical insecurity

218
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,220
that i didn't look korean

219
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,480
and i also, as i was growing up

220
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,380
because my dad spoke english in the house

221
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,340
and because i only went to american schools

222
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,040
i only picked up english

223
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,640
i didn't pick up korean

224
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,440
because i wasn't very involved

225
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,620
in korean communities growing up

226
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,180
i did have korean friends growing up

227
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,460
and they were a huge part of my life

228
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,760
and they still kind of are

229
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,200
but they're all kind of doing their own things as

230
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,420
everyone really does after high school and all that

231
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,860
i was mostly surrounded by korean friends

232
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,540
just because it was kind of like

233
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,660
being with people who you can relate to

234
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,460
but as i got older, personally for me

235
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,660
my insecurities were getting a little too out of hand

236
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,700
that it started affecting my relationships

237
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,580
with not only just other people but also with myself

238
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,760
i was becoming more self-aware as usually one does

239
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,700
you start to really think about yourself as you grow up

240
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,900
i already carried this insecurity

241
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,780
throughout most of my youth

242
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,820
of being behind other people

243
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,480
just because that's kind of how i grew up

244
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,300
i became more and more insecure about me

245
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,860
not being able to speak korean or

246
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,020
understand korean etiquette and culture

247
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,200
and that kind of stuff

248
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,700
and more and more, i would

249
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:46,700
make mistakes that affected my self-esteem

250
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,460
i went to korean church and all that

251
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,200
but whenever i was part of these communities

252
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,380
i felt this personal detachment from everyone else

253
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,680
just because i felt like, again

254
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,940
i wasn't blending in

255
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,200
i felt like i was lacking something

256
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,960
and when i was in these korean communities

257
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,620
they would be able to speak to each other

258
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,820
in korean for fun

259
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,660
and i always felt kind of embarrassed

260
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,860
that i couldn't participate like this

261
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,580
it was really more of like a personal insecurity

262
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,380
that i just couldn't communicate

263
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,500
even though it really didn't matter that much

264
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,420
because obviously they could speak english

265
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,120
and it was just a thing they were able to do

266
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,680
and obviously my upbringing was different than them

267
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,340
but because i wasn't very confident in myself already

268
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,340
it really took a toll on just how i felt about myself

269
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,040
and my identity and that kind of stuff

270
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,920
and communicating with korean adults especially

271
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,760
really affected my self-esteem

272
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,320
because i wouldn't be able to communicate with them

273
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,120
and it really just felt embarrassing for me

274
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,900
that i couldn't speak korean and i was just like

275
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,640
i just felt like they were judging me

276
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,840
and the way that i grew up

277
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,340
like

278
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,960
this korean can't speak korean what is she

279
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,260
so it was always a personal kind of feeling

280
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,740
i never really complained about it

281
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,640
just because i didn't want to

282
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,720
or feel like i needed to complain about it

283
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,480
but inside it was very

284
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,260
it was just disappointing for me

285
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,260
that i couldn't participate like this

286
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,160
everyone else could blend in so easily

287
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,100
between being an american and being a korean

288
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,220
and for me

289
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,320
i couldn't really identify with being korean

290
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,740
because i honestly couldn't

291
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,240
relate to the culture or speak the language

292
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:27,120
so it was just frustrating, really

293
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,040
i was already a pretty socially anxious person

294
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,720
so this adding on to that just

295
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,860
made knowing who i was really difficult

296
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,760
eventually this insecurity of

297
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,820
not blending in with my peers

298
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,500
really got to me and i just

299
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,860
kind of detached myself from these communities

300
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,000
just because i already felt like i didn't belong

301
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,220
even though it really didn't have to go to that extent

302
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,400
it's just personally it got to a point where

303
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,580
i kind of needed to leave

304
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,100
because i didn't feel great about

305
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,600
not being able to communicate in my own language

306
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,360
personally i already felt physically different from

307
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,940
other koreans just because

308
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,060
i have naturally curly hair [not today bc this is 2nd day hair]

309
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,440
which is kind of strange for an east asian

310
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,860
especially for a korean

311
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,100
that's really bright

312
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,800
i honestly still don't know how i have curly/wavy hair

313
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,000
physically i already felt like i didn't belong

314
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,980
and then culturally i obviously didn't

315
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,140
belong in that sense, so i was just like

316
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,980
then what makes me a korean?

317
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:24,720
and so

318
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,920
at that time i didn't understand the concept of it

319
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,140
so it really got to my self-confidence and my self-esteem

320
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,820
because i really didn't know how to deal with it

321
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,520
so in high school

322
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,320
i was surrounded by a different social group

323
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,440
because my friends were moving around

324
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,680
people were moving on, that kind of stuff

325
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,060
so naturally i went to a new friend group

326
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,360
and my friend group

327
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:49,100
was entirely not korean

328
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,860
just because that's how things turned out

329
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,980
ok see so i already finished my makeup

330
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,320
actually i should do my mascara

331
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,820
so naturally i had this different friend group

332
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,360
that was not korean

333
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,580
so i didn't have that opportunity to

334
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,240
be immersed in korean culture

335
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,960
just because there was really no tie to it

336
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,140
other than my parents and my family and all that

337
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,060
and nothing in my life really urged me to

338
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,000
be connected to my korean side

339
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:19,460
i was very much immersed in western culture

340
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,380
i was watching programs from the UK

341
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:26,760
and stuff from america, american tv shows that kind of stuff obviously

342
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,020
because i'm american

343
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,660
so that's what i was kind of into

344
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:34,200
i didn't pay much attention to korean media at all

345
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,720
i wasn't watching korean dramas or listening to kpop

346
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,500
or anything in high school, really

347
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,140
because that wasn't part of my social circle

348
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,180
my social environment

349
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,240
and so through that time i was really not emotionally

350
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,440
connected to myself

351
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,380
i was really kind of living every single day

352
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,760
just to get to the next day

353
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,020
and eventually graduate

354
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,320
and i was just having fun

355
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,860
i was very much still insecure in high school

356
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,860
but at that point i wasn't letting it control my life

357
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:01,940
or affect my life

358
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,820
i was living my life

359
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,960
in high school i really didn't think about being korean

360
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,000
it wasn't something i had to worry about

361
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,040
the crucial point in my journey of being korean american

362
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,460
really happened in my last year of high school

363
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,680
and on from that

364
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,160
there was a personal situation

365
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,660
that affected my entire family

366
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,900
and myself especially

367
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,780
and it was in my last year of high school

368
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,720
when my great-grandma

369
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,220
who was a huge part of my family really

370
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,660
she was dealing with alzheimer's

371
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,100
and she was getting old

372
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,400
and she was in the hospital, and

373
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,700
why did i put mascara on

374
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,720
i probably should've put mascara on after this

375
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,380
this was really wrong timing

376
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,720
in the last part of 2014/2015

377
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,300
my great-grandma

378
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,320
was in the hospital dealing with alzheimer's

379
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,660
we only got to visit my grandma about once a year

380
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,820
just because she lived in a different state

381
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,120
she lived in america

382
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,940
that's how my mom was able to come to the US

383
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,780
because my great-grandma also came

384
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,540
but my great-grandma was

385
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,980
sick and she was dealing with alzheimer's

386
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:17,740
so she already

387
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,580
couldn't really remember who we were

388
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,520
and because we were only able to visit her once a year

389
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,840
we didn't know

390
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,080
how she was doing, we didn't know

391
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,140
that she got to this point

392
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:30,480
and

393
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,580
and so she was in the hospital

394
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,280
and

395
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,500
this was the first time i was dealing with

396
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,280
a family member

397
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,060
being sick, and

398
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,680
at this stage in life

399
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,880
and it really was surreal for me

400
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,760
just because

401
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:53,100
just because i didn't know how to deal with it

402
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,420
because throughout high school

403
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,500
i didn't worry about this kind of stuff

404
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,500
even though obviously time was passing

405
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,340
and

406
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,740
for me it was something i couldn't comprehend

407
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,940
but when i visited her at the hospital

408
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,400
it was starting to hit me that, you know, she

409
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,740
didn't remember us

410
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,940
and after being so careless about

411
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,240
not about myself but

412
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:18,660
not really thinking about myself at a deeper level

413
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:22,120
suddenly it was all kind of hitting me at the same time

414
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,040
that

415
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,040
so much time passed and

416
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,220
there was so much that i wanted to do

417
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,020
that i didn't think about

418
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,260
why did i wear mascara

419
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,500
so at this point my grandma

420
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,920
didn't really remember us that well

421
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,960
my great-grandma by the way is my mom's grandma

422
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,980
so she was a very huge part of her life

423
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,660
she basically raised her

424
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,100
my great-grandma was a huge part of my life as well

425
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,560
when i was younger i would look forward to

426
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,420
her staying over with us

427
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,960
even though there was this

428
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,660
literaly language barrier

429
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,400
she was a huge part of my childhood

430
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,540
and i would be excited whenever she would stay with us

431
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:04,680
and when she would brush my hair every single morning

432
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,300
even though

433
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,880
my hair, you're not supposed to brush it

434
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,020
like the way that she did

435
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,580
she didn't really understand that

436
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,680
curly hair, you're not supposed to

437
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,300
brush it with a certain brush

438
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,260
she didn't really understand that but she still did

439
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:22,620
because she wanted to make my hair nice and pretty

440
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,680
there was that cultural difference that always made me kind of

441
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,820
laugh as i got older

442
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,700
as i understood my hair more

443
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,080
so she was a huge part of my life

444
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,580
but

445
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,900
the thing that kind of really hit me

446
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,880
when all this was happening

447
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,440
was the fact that

448
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:42,740
i realized i never really had a full

449
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,040
conversation with her

450
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,420
nor do i even remember having a conversation with her

451
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,520
so this sort of guilt

452
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,240
started-

453
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,440
so this sense of guilt was just

454
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,460
jumping out at me from nowhere

455
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,300
because i didn't think about it

456
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,980
i took it for granted

457
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,840
i always for some reason thought

458
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,880
my grandma was just going to be around for a long time

459
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,000
and this overwhelming sense of guilt

460
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,200
just came at me

461
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,240
and i was like

462
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,660
i really never had a conversation with her

463
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,660
because she can't speak english

464
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:28,600
and i never bothered to speak with her in korean

465
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,380
because i couldn't

466
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,260
and so

467
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,940
that was really when i started realizing

468
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,240
literally i don't know why i did my makeup

469
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,280
i should've just left my face bare

470
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,400
i also just felt

471
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,500
helpless

472
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,640
because at this point there was nothing i could do

473
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,500
she already didn't remember who we were

474
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,840
so it really was just a helpless time

475
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,760
that there was nothing i could do at this point

476
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,320
except be there for her

477
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,740
as much as possible

478
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,040
from then on that's kind of when

479
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,940
i took myself more seriously

480
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:08,100
and thought about how i can't really

481
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,140
be distracted from myself anymore

482
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,980
i really should think more because

483
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,620
things change so fast

484
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,260
so a few months later my great-grandma did

485
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,520
pass away

486
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,660
that was kind of the end of that part of my life

487
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:24,180
so that's kind of when i became more self-reflexive

488
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,620
and started taking myself more seriously

489
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,460
because i was really away from this part of me

490
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,940
that i could have spent more time on

491
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,140
so it was just a very frustrating time because

492
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:34,820
at the time too

493
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:38,520
i was still dealing with insecurities that i kind of pushed back

494
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,280
so moving on from that, i

495
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,680
graduated high school

496
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,960
it was my last year of high school when this happened

497
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,020
so i was about to finish high school

498
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,280
so i finished high school

499
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,040
and this was when i finally

500
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,620
was going to college

501
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,900
being independent, really learning a lot

502
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,800
being by myself, that kind of stuff

503
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,260
and because i was being more self-reflexive

504
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,620
and because i was analyzing my life a little bit more

505
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,480
this was when the process happened of when

506
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,380
i started becoming more aware of my background

507
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:07,980
and everything

508
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,560
in college i learned a whole lot more

509
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,060
about the self

510
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,600
i was taking a lot of psychology classes

511
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,320
sociology classes, all that kind of stuff

512
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,520
really just being more exposed to everything

513
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,560
and i was just becoming more educated about

514
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,400
a person

515
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,100
so i was being more self-reflexive

516
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,980
and more empathetic at this point

517
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:29,200
because before i didn't really care so much about

518
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,000
these deeper things

519
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,260
i was just going through the motions

520
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,920
just trying to get through life

521
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,200
that i never really

522
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:39,440
thought about people or myself

523
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,200
or anything at a deeper sense

524
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,480
so in college i was becoming more

525
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,880
aware of how people worked

526
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,420
just to say i'm not a psychology major

527
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:47,920
i'm

528
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,940
not an expert at this kind of stuff

529
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,860
but i was definitely becoming more exposed to it

530
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,340
so my mom never really showed us

531
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:57,220
how my great-grandma passing away affected her

532
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,220
i assumed she was heartbroken because

533
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,820
obviously if i was heartbroken

534
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,480
she would've been much more heartbroken

535
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,720
but i never really

536
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,080
realized how much this affected her

537
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,180
until she told me

538
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,020
as i got older my parents would just

539
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,760
talk to me about more things

540
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,540
and relate to me on a personal level

541
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,320
and there was this one day when my mom

542
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,300
told me

543
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,220
how important my great-grandma was to her

544
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,320
and it was because

545
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,880
my great-grandma she spoke only korean

546
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,760
she was culturally very korean

547
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,660
so this was how my mom was able to connect to

548
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,480
korea and connect to her old family

549
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,220
and so when my great-grandma passed away

550
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,440
that kind of side of my mom

551
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,080
just kind of vanished

552
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,200
and it just felt a little more lonely for her

553
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,380
and i never realized that

554
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,900
because i always kind of took

555
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,200
her speaking english

556
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,780
being able to speak 2 languages

557
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,640
being able to switch from culture to culture

558
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,120
i took that for granted

559
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,700
and i didn't realize that

560
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,480
it's still hard for her to

561
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,060
understand american culture

562
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,460
even though she's able to speak english

563
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,720
that doesn't mean she's part of the american culture

564
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,840
and so when my dad and i are speaking to each other

565
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,140
we can speak for a long time about anything

566
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,140
because we actually understand the context and all that

567
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,200
but my mom she sometimes doesn't understand that

568
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,200
it's just like how i'm not able to understand

569
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,880
or i wasn't able to understand

570
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,960
korean culture and etiquette

571
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,200
and i felt that shame and embarrassment

572
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,160
and that detachment

573
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,480
but i never pieced it together

574
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,960
and saw my mom was experiencing the same thing

575
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,000
but kind of the other way around

576
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,500
and so at this point i realized that my mom too was

577
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,580
very

578
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,640
heavily affected by my great-grandma passing

579
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,300
and this kind of side to her was gone

580
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,940
and she didn't really have someone she can

581
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,820
fully 100% communicate with

582
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:41,620
heart to heart

583
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,160
even though she had family here

584
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,080
there was still that cultural difference no matter what

585
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,760
and it really was just difficult to understand

586
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,100
but because i was becoming more

587
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,780
aware of things outside of myself

588
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,800
i started to really see the value

589
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,400
in owning my korean identity

590
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,740
being part of my culture

591
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,880
because it's not just

592
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,440
being able to speak a language or not

593
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,920
it really affected me

594
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,300
at a much more personal level

595
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,740
because i realized that

596
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,100
if i'm not able to speak korean

597
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,600
if i'm not able to have a sense of korean culture

598
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,480
i'm gonna have this distance from my mom as well

599
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,960
and i didn't want that

600
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,340
i just got tired of

601
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,740
this distance and this detachment

602
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,660
just looking back i wish i was

603
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,100
just more secure of myself

604
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,640
so i could just be part of it because

605
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,360
being distant from your culture

606
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,060
it really is a lonely feeling

607
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,120
and so at this point, because i was really

608
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:33,920
by myself

609
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,520
and i had nothing to lose

610
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,880
i wanted to immerse myself more

611
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,200
in the korean culture because

612
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,700
i didn't want my mom to feel so lonely

613
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,840
and for myself, i didn't want to feel detached anymore

614
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,440
and at this point social media was becoming a bigger thing

615
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,560
i had the internet

616
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,420
i finally had these resources around me

617
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,020
that i was like

618
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,640
i think it's time to just own it

619
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,960
and just immerse myself more because

620
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,400
i really had nothing to lose

621
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,080
i would only be able to gain this part of me

622
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,680
that i was always kind of afraid to gain

623
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,280
and kind of always far from

624
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,620
even if people might not think i'm a korean

625
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:08,100
even if i'm not able to communicate with other koreans

626
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,040
or relate to them

627
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,940
no matter what it's still 100% a part of me

628
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
my entire family is from korea

629
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,540
even though i was born in america

630
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,140
it's still 100% part of me

631
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,360
even if other people don't think so

632
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,800
it's still who i am

633
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,020
and that kind of just took too long for me to realize

634
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,420
sorry my camera died

635
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,400
but anyway

636
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,420
there was just nothing stopping me from

637
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,820
finally being immersed in my culture

638
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,640
i was 19 and

639
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,940
i became much more aware of myself

640
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,400
and all that, that i just

641
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,560
didn't want to be ashamed anymore

642
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,160
of trying to be myself

643
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,800
you know obviously growing up i may have

644
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,360
developed slowly

645
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,040
i may have not been able to

646
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,200
personally related with other koreans

647
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,600
but that was when i was younger

648
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,620
and i can't let that affect my life anymore

649
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:58,260
so from then on i decided to

650
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,380
finally start learning korean

651
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,900
because i finally had the internet

652
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,680
i had resources to finally teach myself korean

653
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,060
but also an important part of me

654
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:11,620
finally being proud of my korean identity was definitely

655
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:12,760
kpop

656
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,160
my parents have always exposed me to kpop

657
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,400
i grew up with bigbang and girls generation

658
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,060
i knew about kpop since i was a kid

659
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,253
there wasn't really this stan culture

660
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,760
of kpop in high school

661
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,380
obviously things have changed

662
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,100
and kpop is a huge thing now

663
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,700
but when i was in high school

664
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,380
even though it really wasn't that long ago

665
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,700
there wasn't that kind of culture

666
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,820
i wasn't able to really be immersed in kpop

667
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,780
and actually

668
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,480
my mom

669
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:42,320
introduced me to bts

670
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,360
which was my first kpop group that i started stanning

671
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,700
my mom actually introduced me to them

672
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,220
because it was the billboard music awards

673
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,220
and my mom was talking about bts

674
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,400
getting the nomination and all that and i was like

675
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,000
huh

676
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:54,840
kpop

677
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:55,520
cool

678
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:58,920
and then i for some reason wanted to check them out

679
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,900
and then it changed my life

680
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,800
but because of that it was kind of this gateway

681
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,380
into korean culture

682
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,620
i started watching more korean dramas

683
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:10,120
listening to more korean artists in general

684
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,320
just finally being able to find stuff to

685
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,820
relate to with my mom

686
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:16,180
my mom was always watching these korean dramas and all that

687
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,540
and i never knew what she was watching or talking about

688
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,920
and now i actually understood

689
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,280
and it kind of just felt

690
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:21,780
nice

691
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:24,080
that i was finally able to relate to my mom

692
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,100
in some kind of sense

693
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:28,480
obviously kpop's not the epitome of korean culture

694
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,840
but it definitely is a part of it

695
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,560
and it helped me kind of be more exposed to

696
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,340
whatever my mom cared about

697
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,100
and i'm very much in love with all of it

698
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,200
and it definitely shaped me

699
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,860
to become the person i am today

700
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,060
for the last year and a half i've been

701
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:44,680
learning korean and i'm definitely better

702
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,240
i still have a slight insecurity about it

703
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,040
just because growing up i used to get teased

704
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,620
for trying to speak korean

705
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,720
there's still, i'm not perfect

706
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,940
there's still that underlying insecurity

707
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,160
oh if i speak korean it's gonna be embarrassing

708
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,360
so even though i don't speak korean all the time

709
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,820
i speak it with my mom

710
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,480
and i speak it with my dad sometimes

711
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,800
but i'm definitely able to understand it more

712
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,860
now i'm actually able to speak to my grandma

713
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,260
my dad's mom

714
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,620
in korean, because

715
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,540
we always spoke in english to her

716
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,700
and we never bothered to try to speak in korean to her

717
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,760
in my first few months that i was learning korean

718
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,780
i surprised her by suddenly starting to speak korean

719
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,640
and she was so surprised

720
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,960
she was so happy

721
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,040
and really appreciative that i was actually learning korean

722
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,640
and it was really just such a nice experience

723
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,440
i want to be able to make my family's life easier because

724
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,900
even though we're all in america

725
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,840
it wouldn't kill me to speak in korean with them

726
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,640
and just make their lives a little bit easier

727
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,440
but that is really my

728
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,180
experience so far growing up korean american

729
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,460
i was very much afraid

730
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,780
to be connected to that side of me

731
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,760
because i always felt like i wasn't enough

732
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,120
and i felt like i couldn't relate to other people

733
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,580
this doesn't just have to do with being korean american

734
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,600
this applies to anyone who

735
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,620
is a child of immigrant parents

736
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,140
coming to a country where

737
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:04,860
you're not the dominant people

738
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:07,560
it can be difficult to know who you are because

739
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,000
you may not feel confident enough to

740
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:12,480
own your ethnical background

741
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,060
but you obviously physically

742
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,980
don't fit in with everyone else

743
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,380
and it's just really weird and hard

744
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,700
and it really can affect you negatively

745
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,760
but there's really just nothing

746
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:27,380
wrong with identifying as the ethnicity that you really are

747
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:30,640
i only gained more by identifying with this part of me

748
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,380
there was nothing that i lost from it

749
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,020
this journey so far of learning is

750
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:37,180
just so eye-opening and rewarding

751
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:40,800
i still obviously don't always 100% feel korean

752
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:41,660
it's still-

753
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,600
it's still hard for me to blend in with a korean community

754
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,520
especially at my school

755
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,000
there's a huge korean community

756
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,300
but obviously there are some differences

757
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,280
but now i'm just not taking it so personally

758
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:52,840
because

759
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,180
oh well

760
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,940
and also lately in korea they've been

761
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,920
styling their hair to kind of

762
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,260
make it wavy

763
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,060
and it kind of just makes me

764
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,060
feel

765
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,920
both happy but also triggered at the same time

766
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,860
because i always used to be so ashamed

767
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:11,480
not ashamed but like, i used to kind of

768
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,800
be sad that my hair wasn't straight

769
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:18,640
but now people are appreciating different hair styles

770
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,500
and so

771
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,560
that's nice i guess

772
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,980
but now it's just, i'm not afraid to

773
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,800
be in touch with my korean side

774
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,520
there's nothing wrong with identifying as my ethnicity

775
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,140
that was my experience

776
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,740
growing up as a korean american

777
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:36,520
it honestly, the past 20 years

778
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,060
have been a lot, but

779
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,380
it's been a lot of growth

780
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:42,180
and there's just a lot more for me to learn

781
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,700
and it's just a nice journey and it's a lot of fun

782
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,940
i hope that you guys can also

783
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,160
if you're also dealing with something like this

784
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:49,660
you can

785
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,640
not be afraid to be in touch with your ethnicity

786
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,100
even if people don't think you're enough

787
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,080
who cares

788
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,160
this is my background this is who i am

789
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,800
i'm going to do as much as i can on my part

790
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,580
to learn about my ethnicity

791
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,980
and own my nationality as well

792
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,540
people should learn more than one language honestly

793
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,560
the world is so interesting

794
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,260
and

795
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,200
people are trying their best, so

796
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:14,980
people should learn more

797
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,400
i hope this video was interesting

798
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,060
and eye-opening

799
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,220
and, wholesome, idk

800
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,960

801
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,900
let me hear it, i wanna hear it

802
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,000
that is all i needed to say

803
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,180
i'm emotionally tired

804
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,380

and

808
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,320
i hope that in your journey of knowing yourself

809
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,100
don't care about what other people think about you

810
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:43,040
just own your own identity

811
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,860
and just do the best that you can

812
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,440
