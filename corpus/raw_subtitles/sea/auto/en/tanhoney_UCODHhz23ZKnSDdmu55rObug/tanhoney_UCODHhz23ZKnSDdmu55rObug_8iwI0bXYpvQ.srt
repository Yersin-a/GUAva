guys are doing great if you guys are new

7
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:18,840
to my channel welcome today I have a

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,310
special video for my Southeast Asian

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,050
girls struggles of a Southeast Asian

10
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,330
girl is a series I started basically

11
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,880
highlighting things that girls like me

12
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,429
go through that we don't talk about but

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,070
we should and I started this because I

14
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:33,540
noticed that on YouTube and just in

15
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,820
social media in general there's

16
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:38,700
definitely a lot of Asian youtubers and

17
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,590
beauty gurus and influencers but I feel

18
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,750
like most of them are East Asian which

19
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,149
is totally great I'm a supporter of all

20
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,559
Asian girls of all girls in general but

21
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:48,989
I just felt like there was a lack of

22
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,550
someone who was similar to me in my

23
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:52,980
first video I talked about being a brown

24
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,449
Asian woman in a world of whitening

25
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,250
products but this video I'm gonna be

26
00:00:54,449 --> 00:01:00,210
talking about Southeast Asian girls and

27
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:03,690
careers and in particular nursing first

28
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:06,210
and foremost for anything else I just

29
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:08,640
want to clarify that nursing is an

30
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,049
amazing job I still think that our ends

31
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,030
are severely underpaid and

32
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:13,500
underappreciated especially when you

33
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,869
factor in the amount of work they do

34
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,610
compared to like the doctor so many of

35
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:19,890
my best friends are RNs and they

36
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:24,090
love it and I think it's a great career

37
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:26,280
but only if you actually want to be a

38
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,750
nurse one question that I always like

39
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,240
just think about why aren't there more

40
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,220
Asians in the creative field

41
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,950
I feel like Asians are some of the most

42
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,960
creative and inventive people on the

43
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,850
planet like just just look at our food

44
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,549
for God's sake looking at it rationally

45
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:44,399
most Southeast Asians who are around my

46
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:46,399
age are probably first generation and it

47
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,200
makes sense because if your parents are

48
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,180
immigrants like mine then you know how

49
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,130
hard they work they came here to another

50
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,110
country speaking little to no English

51
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:56,579
they are overworked at these stressful

52
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:59,009
jobs where they don't get paid nearly

53
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:01,170
enough but they did all of this for us

54
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:03,000
and they did it so that we wouldn't have

55
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,009
to struggle like they did so it makes

56
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,220
sense why most of them want us to be in

57
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:10,530
a field where it is going to be stable

58
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,690
and it is always going to be needed I

59
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,500
spent two and a half years in college

60
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,350
doing

61
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,090
Rex for nursing and even though I knew

62
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,860
since high school like oh I'm gonna be a

63
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,630
nurse going to be a nurse anytime I had

64
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,890
to talk about what I was going to be or

65
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:25,020
what I was working towards

66
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:27,750
I freaking hated it everyone around me

67
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,250
was so excited to talk about like their

68
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,470
future career and what they were

69
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:34,620
striving for when it came down to me I

70
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:36,660
just didn't understand like why do I not

71
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,640
feel the same sense of excitement that

72
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:41,010
everybody else does I never got a chance

73
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,200
when I was younger like in high school

74
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:46,020
middle school to really think about like

75
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,180
what is it that I want to do sometimes I

76
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:50,910
do wish that I figured it out earlier

77
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:53,100
but you know it's all in God's timing so

78
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:55,560
I am right where I need to be at this

79
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:58,560
moment so I'm happy for that but of

80
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,250
course back then I was very very

81
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,290
depressed

82
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,880
I remember at my first serving job there

83
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,590
was this couple that I served and they

84
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,790
really really liked me they were older

85
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,900
so then they were asking me like Oh what

86
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:08,250
do you want to do it was like my

87
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,170
automatic response oh I want to be a

88
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,940
nurse and I remember they told me like

89
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:13,110
Oh like where do you want to go and I

90
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,790
was like well of course I want to apply

91
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:17,340
to Loma Linda because it's pretty much

92
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:20,459
like the best nursing school in my area

93
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:22,830
turns out they are good friends with the

94
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:24,420
Dean of Loma Linda and then they slid me

95
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:26,100
their number and they were like when you

96
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,650
apply to Loma Linda give us a call and

97
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,000
then we will call up the Dean and let

98
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:32,580
them know that you're applying it was

99
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,110
pretty much solid like they loved me but

100
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,730
despite all of that you know even though

101
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:39,000
my grades were good and now I had this

102
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:41,580
into one of the best programs in

103
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,190
Southern California there was still like

104
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:46,110
something in my heart that just told me

105
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:48,450
like no there was just always something

106
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:50,850
like heavy that still sat with me I

107
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:54,209
think the best word to describe how I

108
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:55,650
felt all those years was trapped I

109
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:58,380
literally felt like I couldn't escape

110
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:00,209
this life this is the pot that is chosen

111
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,920
for me this is the path I have to follow

112
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:04,680
no matter what but like I said there was

113
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,840
a time where it came to a crossroad I

114
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,850
was almost done with my prereqs I just

115
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,040
had to take Anatomy and then I could

116
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:12,750
apply to the nursing programs I'll never

117
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,250
forget that summer I remember I was

118
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,959
taking summer school friend out of me I

119
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:18,030
called my friend one of my close friends

120
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:20,760
Miguel love that guy in the gala if

121
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:22,620
you're watching homie for life till the

122
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,050
day we die called him up and I was like

123
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,490
hey like can I come over so he was like

124
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,980
yeah like I thought you were going to

125
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,450
class

126
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,800
no I mean I need to come over so he's

127
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:32,620
like okay when I came over and I just

128
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:35,110
like was so freaking emotional and I

129
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:36,610
told him like all this stuff that I was

130
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:39,520
feeling and I was like I have no idea

131
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:42,310
why and then he was like dude you know

132
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,050
why that just sent me over the edge and

133
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:46,000
I remember just really thinking about it

134
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,860
yeah I don't want to be a nurse and that

135
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,440
was the first time I ever said that out

136
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,810
loud it was definitely freeing in a way

137
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,640
like being able to say that but it was

138
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:57,310
like now that I said it it's like oh

139
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:59,950
 where do I go now and obviously the

140
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:02,410
next step was to tell my parents they

141
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:03,820
are the reason why I stayed quiet I was

142
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:05,620
just scared of disappointing them you

143
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:07,510
know because if like my parents get mad

144
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:09,610
at me if they like yell at me if they

145
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:11,680
crowned me if they do anything like that

146
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:13,390
I can handle that that's fine just the

147
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,520
thought of them being disappointed in me

148
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:17,920
that was what scared me and that was

149
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,300
what I wanted to avoid completely long

150
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,590
story short not gonna get into that

151
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,740
because I'll probably just start crying

152
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:26,410
but once I did that it was like this

153
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:29,050
huge weight lifted off my shoulders and

154
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:30,700
I felt like I could finally fully be

155
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:31,900
myself and I'm not gonna lie you know

156
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,690
there are still times where I get

157
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:37,600
frustrated like even today where it's

158
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:39,520
like obviously I'm not at the level of

159
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,160
achievement that I want to be at

160
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,720
career-wise and sometimes it just makes

161
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,460
me wonder like what would have happened

162
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,320
if I just stayed in nursing I definitely

163
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:49,630
would be a lot more financially stable I

164
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:52,270
wouldn't be working in a restaurant with

165
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:53,860
bitch-ass customers and I'd definitely

166
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:56,800
be able to afford a lot of the things

167
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:59,500
that I wish I could afford now but at

168
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,510
the same time I know that I wouldn't be

169
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,550
happy because even though I am still

170
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:06,310
building and working towards my dream

171
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:08,740
career I am so much more happier and

172
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:11,290
full of life now that girl all those

173
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:13,690
years ago who was a nursing major she

174
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:15,640
feels like a stranger to me so on a

175
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:18,400
lighter note I just want to say that if

176
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:21,190
you are looking for a sign to go after

177
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,990
your dream job this is your sign you are

178
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:25,690

179
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:28,270
watching this for a reason Southeast

180
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:30,430
Asian or not take this as your sign and

181
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:33,850
with that I do want this video to be

00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:35,380
helpful as well so I have a few tips

183
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:38,470
that I want to share with you guys that

184
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:40,449
I wish I knew the first is to be honest

185
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:42,279
with yourself in every decision you make

186
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:44,289
anything you do any choice you make make

187
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:46,629
sure you are being completely honest and

188
00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:48,370
being true to yourself the second is to

189
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:50,499
figure out a plan before going cold

190
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:52,930
turkey yes you should go after what you

191
00:06:50,499 --> 00:06:54,580
want but definitely don't just drop

192
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:56,770
everything like I'm not telling you to

193
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,779
drop out of university I'm not telling

194
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:01,330
you to quit your job there's all these

195
00:06:58,779 --> 00:07:03,339
 steps in between before you get

196
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:05,710
to your dream career so figure that out

197
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:07,719
first that brings me to how to tell your

198
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:09,729
parents Southeast Asian parents they

199
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:10,870
want their kids in the end to be happy

200
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:13,419
but they also want them to be

201
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:15,400
financially stable so instead of telling

202
00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:19,240
your parents hey mom and dad I'm gonna

203
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:20,499
quit school and be this piece yeah don't

204
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,939
do that because that's just gonna spur a

205
00:07:20,499 --> 00:07:24,159
lot of arguments you know your parents

206
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:25,839
better than anyone so know what kind of

207
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:27,219
questions that they'll ask you know what

208
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:28,960
kind of things they'll say to you and

209
00:07:27,219 --> 00:07:30,339
then make sure you have a rebuttal for

210
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,749
it that way when you present it to them

211
00:07:30,339 --> 00:07:34,479
you're like hey mom and dad

212
00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:37,360
I don't want to do this anymore instead

213
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,860
I want to do this and here's my plan on

214
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,659
how to get there and how to make money

215
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:42,249
don't forget to add that last part in

216
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:46,149
and my third tip that I would want you

217
00:07:42,249 --> 00:07:47,830
guys to take after is to if you can

218
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:50,560
afford it definitely try to take some

219
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:53,259
time off to soul-search and what I mean

220
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,839
by that is to travel to try new hobbies

221
00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:57,580
to meet new people to just do

222
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:59,620
experiences that you never would have

223
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:01,959
done before and know this is not an

224
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:03,610
excuse to do a bunch of drugs so that's

225
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:05,199
not what I'm saying but you will be so

226
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:06,610
shocked at what you can learn about

227
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,649
yourself when you step out of your

228
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:10,659
comfort zone before I figure it out oh I

229
00:08:08,649 --> 00:08:12,009
want to be a director I did journalism

230
00:08:10,659 --> 00:08:14,050
on my school newspaper for like a

231
00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:17,139
semester I switched my major to

232
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:18,879
communications I even went to check out

233
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:20,409
a culinary school I don't know I want to

234
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,639
be a director until I took a trip to

235
00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:23,889
Thailand and I was like filming

236
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:26,469
everything and making like a video about

237
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:28,270
it and I realize like dude I

238
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:30,490
love this I want to do this all the

239
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:31,959
 time and through that experience

240
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:34,240
that's how I discovered something about

241
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:36,399
myself that is very crucial and very

242
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,459
important to me today honestly the most

243
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:42,159
gut-wrenching part is the crossroads but

244
00:08:39,459 --> 00:08:44,050
like once you make that decision and you

245
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,040
choose to be happy and you choose to do

246
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:47,560
something for yourself

247
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,470
everything after will be hard work and

248
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,940
it might be tedious but you will be so

249
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:54,220
much happier because you're finally

250
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:55,570
pursuing something that you love to do

251
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:57,580
I'm right there with you guys I know

252
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:58,960

253
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,400
feel like you just want to give up and

254
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,380

00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,450
