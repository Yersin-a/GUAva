1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,640
what's up everyone

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,279
welcome back to my channel today's video

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,240
has

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:11,440
one purpose and one purpose only and

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,280
that is to convince

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:18,640
you yes you to go to community college

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,560
this fall especially if you are

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,560
watching this in the year 2020. there's

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,080
a lot of stigma behind community college

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,599
but i feel like a lot of that is over

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,480
inflated you know by

12
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,240
the media by high schools for some

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,679
reason a lot of high schools don't push

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,520
community college they just want you to

15
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,239
go straight to university

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,160
and you know a lot of this stuff also

17
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,280
depends on who you are as a person

18
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,600
if you see perspiration on my upper lip

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,360
please just ignore it it is hot in here

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,360
because i had to turn off the ac

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,559
so it wouldn't be noisy in this video so

22
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,879
i'm doing this for you okay

23
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,760
let's just move on the number one reason

24
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,320
i would

25
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,920
push and encourage someone to start off

26
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,320
at a community college

27
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,960
is if you're not sure what you want to

28
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,879
major in

29
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,239
from the time that you graduate high

30
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,199
school as

31
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,560
barely adults to the time when you're

32
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,840
like in your mid-20s

33
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,680
um like me a lot of things change

34
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,000
and i'm not just talking about your

35
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,720
growing bodies or you know the people

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,520
around you

37
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,400
or your circumstances but you yourself

38
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,520
as a person

39
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,640
mentally spiritually emotionally all of

40
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,040
those things

41
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,000
change looking back at who i was when i

42
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,200
was like 17

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,759
18 when i first graduated i

44
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,040
i just cannot believe my mother allowed

45
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,079
that person to

46
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,079
walk out of the house because i was so

47
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,159
 stupid and what i thought i

48
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,720
wanted at 17 and 18

49
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,320
is so different than what i want now

50
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,320
what i prioritize now

51
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,840
college you know that four to five year

52
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,320
mark is such

53
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,880
a great time to figure out who you are

54
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,520
what you

55
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,560
love who you love when you attend

56
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,719
community college

57
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,759
it is so much cheaper and cost effective

58
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,479
that it gives you

59
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,000
a lot more leeway to kind of you know

60
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,399
switch between majors

61
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,640
figure out what piques your interest or

62
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,080
to figure out if school is even for you

63
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,520
because let's be honest school

64
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,680
isn't for everyone all right so let me

65
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,720
tell you about what happened to me

66
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,480
um oh so good

67
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,400
this is my spin drift by the way

68
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,680
sparkling water only five calories

69
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,720
when i first graduated as a dumb a dumb

70
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,520


71
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,959
in this big world i pretty much thought

72
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,160
that i knew what i wanted

73
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,959
when i started college i went in as a

74
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,160
nursing major

75
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,920
and if you guys want to hear the full

76
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,440
story i'll put the link up in the cards

77
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,160
in the description box

78
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:41,040
but basically all i had known my entire

79
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,040
life was nursing nursing nursing nursing

80
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,720
get to the two-year mark when all my

81
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,760
prereqs are done and i have to apply to

82
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,319
nursing school

83
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,080
and i'm like holy i don't want to

84
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,120
be a nurse and let me tell you for the

85
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,800
next two years

86
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,120
i did communications i did journalism

87
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,480
i was even on the newspaper at my

88
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,440
community college

89
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,400
and i even considered culinary school so

90
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,360
i really

91
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,720
explored everything that i could and the

92
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,720
funny part is

93
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,440
in the end i didn't even end up pursuing

94
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,879
a degree for any of the majors that i

95
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,800
thought i was interested in

96
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,400
one thing i found out through my

97
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,760
community college experience was

98
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,519
wow school is not for me and i ended up

99
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,000
dropping out and going on a

100
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,799
completely creative route just making

101
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,519
videos

102
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,400
freelancing and just honing in on my

103
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,879
craft

104
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,080
and because of that last year i was able

105
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,480
to get a job as a

106
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,920
content creator working for this amazing

107
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,640
company that i love

108
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,159
doing what i love and it's just it's so

109
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,959
funny how like that all

110
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,560
worked out had i went to a university

111
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,400
right out of high school

112
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,519
then things might have been different

113
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,680
maybe i would have been like you know

114
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,920
what i am not going to waste all this

115
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,760
money that i put into the school

116
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,760
you know so i probably would have just

117
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,959
stayed and continued pursuing one of the

118
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,519
degrees that i

119
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,239
switched over to or maybe i wouldn't

120
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,920
have even

121
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,599
you know touched on my creative side

122
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,200
because i would feel like it was

123
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,280
irresponsible because i'm like

124
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,439
dude you just paid tuition this year

125
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,720
like why are you gonna go waste time

126
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,640
making videos or doing something

127
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,319
creative you know what i mean so

128
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,680
community college allowed me that

129
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,479
financial freedom

130
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,720
to make mistakes and to grow and to

131
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,880
finally come to terms with who i was as

132
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,880
a person who i am as a person

133
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,199
and i just would not change my

134
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,360
experience anyway at all

135
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,240
and i say that last part very seriously

136
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,199
because

137
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,120
when i first went to community college

138
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,880
all i could think in my head was regret

139
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,479
like oh my god i'm not getting the

140
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,720
 college experience

141
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,320
i'm such a loser for going to community

142
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,800
and for all of those years

143
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,919
i just had that thought like always in

144
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,280
my head you know

145
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:51,759
but looking at where i am now i am

146
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,600
so grateful that yes i did go to

147
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,680
community college and i'm proud to say

148
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,840
that i'm proud to say my story so

149
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,120
i wanted to give you guys some insight

150
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,240
on that as well

151
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,160
um but you know it's not all fun and

152
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,000
games over here i'm gonna keep it real

153
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,560
with you guys so i'm going to talk about

154
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,039
some of the things to watch out for as

155
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,280
well

156
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,919
so the main thing to watch out for is

157
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:17,199
the community college trap

158
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:19,280
and yes it is real what does that mean

159
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,440
community college trap is essentially

160
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,759
when you go to a community college

161
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,520
there's going to be a lot of people who

162
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,759
are kind of just like getting by

163
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,880
and they're not really doing anything

164
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,400
they're not really like

165
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:35,840
you know going after like what they want

166
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,000
wholeheartedly and you might fall into

167
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,360
that as well you might get lazy you

168
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,039
might be like ah whatever

169
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,560
it's community college i can just go

170
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,479
back next semester

171
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,080
i'll take a break i'll do this and then

172
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,880
you end up just stuck there

173
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,880
or you end up you know not going after

174
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,840
your dreams so that is like

175
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,360
one huge thing to look out for but there

176
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,080
are ways to prevent that

177
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,960
and again it comes down to who you are

178
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,000
as a person

179
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,240
so here are some tips number one

180
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,360
visit your counselor every quarter

181
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,440
semester

182
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,479
whatever system your school is on make

183
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,960
that appointment

184
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,840
and yes it's annoying but get it done

185
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,919
because

186
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,840
your counselor is going to be the key to

187
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,560
you getting out of community college

188
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,160
and pursuing your dreams because they

189
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,960
will help you figure out what classes

190
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,280
you need to take

191
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,800
for what college you want to transfer to

192
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,360
essentially they are the key

193
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,639
number two even during the breaks take

194
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,120
an online class

195
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,160
i'm a strong believer that you work hard

196
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,160
you play hard

197
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,600
but in community college you know for

198
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,919
those first couple years it's

199
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,759
all about grind time baby so when you

200
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,840
have uh a winter break

201
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,880
summer break whatever you don't need to

202
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,680
take like a full

203
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,560
like like workload of classes but take

204
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,960
like at least

205
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,800
one online class that way you're still

206
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,520
connected and you won't like

207
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,039
fall back and you won't get lazy and

208
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,000
it'll just help you get out of there

209
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:59,199
faster as well

210
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,639
number three do not skip class it is so

211
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:04,000
important that you don't skip class

212
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:06,080
you attending every class is the key to

213
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,919
you succeeding and getting the hell out

214
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,000
of there okay because once you skip one

215
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,400
class everything else falls behind

216
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,919
so it's not worth it don't skip a class

217
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,160
and number four

218
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,440
take classes that fit you and your

219
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,280
scheduled best

220
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,880
now what does this mean that means if

221
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,000
you're not a morning person

222
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,720
no do not take that 7am class because i

223
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,800
promise you

224
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,319
you will not make it you won't and it's

225
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,720
just going to be a waste of time

226
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,840
and money so you know get an afternoon

227
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,520
class and also

228
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,599
don't take more online classes than you

229
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,400
can handle because online classes you

230
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,479
really have to be

231
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,080
disciplined i am not one of those people

232
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,919
therefore i have pretty much

233
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,120
i pretty much dropped out of every

234
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,440
online class i had

235
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,639
so you know word of warning to the wise

236
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,440
if you are

237
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,759
watching this in 2020 when the pandemic

238
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,960
is

239
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,960
in full force and you are

240
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,319
attending or going to attend a

241
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,840
university that

242
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:02,160
is going to make you pay full tuition

243
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,599
for online classes don't do it and if

244
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,560
you're worried about the college

245
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,960
experience

246
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,599
the parties and stuff like that like

247
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,000
hello

248
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,759
just go to like one of your friends

249
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,440
college parties or something like

250
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,360
it's it's not that big of a deal and i

251
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,280
promise you you are not going to care

252
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,840
about the time you did seven shots in a

253
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,199
row

254
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,360
with kyle from sigma apple pie because

255
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,440
in the end it doesn't even matter there

256
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,120
are much more important things out there

257
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,520
to worry about and to put your

258
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,280
