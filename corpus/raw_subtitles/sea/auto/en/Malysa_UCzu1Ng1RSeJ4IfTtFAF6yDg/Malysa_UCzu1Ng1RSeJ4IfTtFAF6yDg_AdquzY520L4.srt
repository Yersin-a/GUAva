00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,319
hi everyone it's melissa here and today

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,359
we are going to be going over

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,400
my past month's budget and how i go

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,000
about budgeting

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,519
so i've never really been great at

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,960
holding myself accountable

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,680
and actually keeping track of my money i

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,680
used to overspend a lot and it hasn't

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,480
been until this past year where i've

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,720
actually

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,480
got control of my money again and that

12
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,480
is all because of budgeting

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,880
budgeting has really helped me keep

14
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,599
track of my money and also

15
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,440
get control of my money again budgeting

16
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,920
is really helpful like i said

17
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,520
for keeping track of your money but also

18
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,399
just getting to know your money and your

19
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,000
money habits

20
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,920
like i said i used to be a spender but

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,480
now that i've been budgeting i

22
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,200
really kept control of my spending and

23
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,520
have really

24
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,440
spent on things that i really wanted

25
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,840
instead of things that i didn't really

26
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,160
need

27
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,160
budgeting helps keep yourself in check

28
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,239
it helps you gain control of your money

29
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,399
and it also keeps you from getting

30
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,000
yourself into more debt because

31
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,440
you're keeping track of where your money

32
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,600
is going and you're also not

33
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,000
overspending which is really helpful

34
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,600
so i'm going to teach you guys how to

35
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,280
set up your budget but also

36
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,600
how i do my budget and what my past

37
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,280
month budget looked like so i like to

38
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,200
budget on a monthly basis

39
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,640
i find that this is really helpful some

40
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,680
people budget on a weekly

41
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,400
some people budget every like quarter

42
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,799
whatever you're more comfortable with do

43
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,360
that

44
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,920
but i tend to do monthly because it

45
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,400
gives me an overview of how much i spent

46
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,759
what my bills were and just how much i

47
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,640
made for that month

48
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,320
so when i budget i tend to do right at

49
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,600
the end of the month so usually on the

50
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,759
last day of the month

51
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,040
or the beginning of the next month so

52
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,320
when it comes to

53
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,399
setting up your budget i'll leave a

54
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,960
template in the description box down

55
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,920
below

56
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,119
for you guys to download i tend to use

57
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,200
google sheets

58
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,640
i used to use microsoft excel but i

59
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,880
found it really helpful

60
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,640
to just be able to go online wherever i

61
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,320
was and look at my budget

62
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,680
i like using google sheets because it

63
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,479
allows me to

64
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,159
put in simple addition and subtraction

65
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,959
formulas to my budget sheet

66
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,160
some people don't like using a document

67
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,280
other people like using

68
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,680
apps so there are plenty of apps such as

69
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,959
mint that help people budget without

70
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,959
inputting the numbers

71
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,800
but i really like to sit down at the end

72
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,800
of the month and calculate the numbers

73
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,920
myself because it gives me

74
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,239
that idea of how i'm spending and i also

75
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,480
come face to face with the numbers i'll

76
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,680
leave other templates down below in case

77
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,680
you don't like mine

78
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,480
or you don't find it very intuitive for

79
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,120
you to me my budget is very simple

80
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,239
to me but you may not find it helpful so

81
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,800
i'll leave those

82
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,640
resources down below as well in case in

83
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,120
case you are a different type of person

84
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,200
so like i said i break down my budget

85
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,720
into five different sections i have

86
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:55,680
my income my bills loans spending

87
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,720
and my totals so for income i have three

88
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,760
lines under that

89
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,480
i have my work other and depop so

90
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,760
work right now as most of you know i am

91
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,200
currently furloughed

92
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,040
so my work is not work it's actually

93
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,360
the unemployment benefits that i'm

94
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,920
receiving so i'll put that

95
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,879
under my work income for other this is

96
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,040
typically

97
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,040
like money that i get from people then

98
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,360
mowing me paypaling me

99
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,560
apple cashing me whatever they may owe

100
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,319
me or

101
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,640
if they wanted to give me something what

102
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:29,360
have you i'll put that under other

103
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,400
so for depop i do make money every month

104
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,799
from depop

105
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,000
i don't make a lot but it is enough for

106
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,879
like spending

107
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,360
and just like buying coffees every now

108
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,760
and then

109
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,720
getting gas things like that so i'll put

110
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,000
depop there

111
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,640
and then i also have a line for my total

112
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,040
income

113
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,239
just to add up the first three lines and

114
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,840
that's basically

115
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,920
the total income that i get for that

116
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,319
month for my bill section these are my

117
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,879
recurring bills so my phone bill

118
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:59,360
credit card bills this also includes any

119
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:02,159
type of subscription so that includes

120
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,319
adobe creative studios and i also have a

121
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,319
line for aggressive payments in case i

122
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,200
do want to aggressively pay off my

123
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,959
credit cards

124
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,400
i have a line for that because every

125
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,360
month i pay the same

126
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,959
amount but if i want to take off more

127
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,519
i'll put that in as well

128
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,600
the next section is my loan section i

129
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,519
like to keep my loans separate from

130
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,440
my bills because i do like to

131
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,639
aggressively pay off my student loans i

132
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,160
don't want to be

133
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,600
in student loan debt forever so i have a

134
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,000
separate section for that

135
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,720
it just allows me to see how much i'm

136
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,600
spending

137
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,199
on my loans compared to like my bills

138
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,360
and my spending habits

139
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,320
for my spending i have three lines i

140
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,400
have food

141
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,560
shopping and miscellaneous under

142
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,280
miscellaneous that is usually where i

143
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,479
put

144
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:51,759
what i spent on for gas as well as any

145
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:54,720
like one-time payments that i have

146
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,520
so for example my squarespace account i

147
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,240
just pay it

148
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,160
annually so i'll put that under the

149
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,639
miscellaneous section because it's not

150
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,960
really

151
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,240
shopping and it's not food at all and

152
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,280
then my next section

153
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,120
is my total section so in each previous

154
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,680
section that i have like i mentioned for

155
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,680
my income i have a total income line i

156
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,120
do that for each section so i have

157
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:20,080
the total bills i pay total loans and

158
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,639
total spending and then for my total

159
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,120
section

160
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,639
i add up all my expenses so that

161
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,680
includes my bills

162
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,000
loans and my spending i take the totals

163
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,360
from

164
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,759
each of those sections and that is in my

165
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,600
total expenses and then my total income

166
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,240
is the same line that i take

167
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,160
from the total income section underneath

168
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,479
that i have my net total so

169
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,280
this is how much i've saved or how much

170
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,800
money i've

171
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,919
i have left over so for my budget for

172
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,759
this past month

173
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,039
i will be putting it in percentages i'm

174
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,960
not really comfortable

175
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,199
with sharing the exact numbers but i

176
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,600
feel like percentages is more helpful

177
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,039
for those of you that are trying to

178
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,000
emulate a budget

179
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:05,120
that will help you aggressively save so

180
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,680
out of my total income i spent 15

181
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,880
of my income towards bills i spent

182
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,680
around 10

183
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,080
of my income towards my loans and i

184
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,240
spent

185
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:19,360
around 22 of my income towards spending

186
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,319
so in total i spent about 47 of my

187
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,680
income and i

188
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:25,600
save 53 of my income

189
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,039
i know not everyone can do this but i've

190
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,560
been aggressively saving

191
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:33,440
so in my emergency savings video

192
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,840
i mentioned how important it is to build

193
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,319
a budget it's definitely the first way

194
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,080
for you to get started on saving

195
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,520
aggressively and making sure you have

196
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,960
enough money in your bank

197
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:48,000
in case of any expenses so i've already

198
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,400
saved up to a fully funded savings

199
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,680
account but now i am currently

200
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,720
aggressively saving

201
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,400
for another goal which is moving out as

202
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,599
some of you may know i am currently

203
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,280
living at home

204
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:03,120
and i plan on moving out of the state

205
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,639
and probably out of the country with

206
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,800
juan and so

207
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,759
we are just saving up and making sure we

208
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,280
have enough

209
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:13,919
to easily transition into our next stop

210
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,720
in life so we're really excited for that

211
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,120
but it

212
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,919
does come with a lot of discipline so

213
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,440
that is why

214
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:23,520
i am saving a lot of my money for a move

215
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,199
just in case anything happens in case i

216
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,440
don't get a job right away

217
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,280
things like that so that is one of my

218
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,759
more closer goals

219
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,479
that i have with my finances some of my

220
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,440
other goals

221
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,400
include paying off my credit card debt

222
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,240
and also

223
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,680
paying off some of my student loans i

224
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,280
have a lot of student loans

225
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,680
like i mentioned before but they're all

226
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,479
broken up into smaller more manageable

227
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,120
loans

228
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,599
so i have a couple loans that are almost

229
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,039
done

230
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:53,120
so i do plan on paying those off as well

231
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,720
i also mentioned this in my emergency

232
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,759
savings video

233
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,400
but right now i am currently paying the

234
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,599
minimum

235
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:04,000
and also interest so that way i'm taking

236
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:06,960
away the principal total and also taking

237
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,720
away the interest that is occurring on

238
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,759
any of my bills whether it be my credit

239
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,240
card debt or

240
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,520
my loans so those are some of the

241
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,039
reasons why i'm saving

242
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:19,599
50 of my income because i want to have

243
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,840
a robust savings account but also once i

244
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,599
reach that goal i want to be able to

245
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,319
know that i'll be able to pay off

246
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,280
my credit cards and my loans it's up to

247
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,759
you how you

248
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,360
want to set up your savings maybe you

249
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:35,039
want to aggressively

250
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,880
pay off your debt for me you can't

251
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,479
get your money back when you pay off

252
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,080
your debt so

253
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,240
it's really important to have that

254
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,039
emergency savings fund before you start

255
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,920
aggressively

256
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,399
paying off your debt other aspects to my

257
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,360
budget

258
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,480
that i really like highly recommend but

259
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,480
you don't have to do it

260
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,680
it's definitely the extra mile when it

261
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,120
comes to budgeting

262
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,240
but that is doing an assets tracker and

263
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,640
a debt tracker

264
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,640
so with excel and google sheets you can

265
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,360
add sheets to your document so the first

266
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,680
sheet

267
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,600
that i have is my budget sheet but then

268
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,399
the next two sheets i have

269
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,440
an assets tracker and a debt tracker at

270
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,720
the end of every month

271
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:17,200
for my assets i line up all of my

272
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,560
banking accounts in my stocks see how

273
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,200
much assets i have

274
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,839
for my debt i do the same thing but with

275
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,000
my debt

276
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,760
so for my debt tracker i have a section

277
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,760
for my credit card debt

278
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,160
and a section for my loan debt and then

279
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,440
i have a line for total debt i like to

280
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,760
do this because

281
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,760
i want to see the overall debt that i'm

282
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,399
making towards my debt

283
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,160
because you can pay your debt month to

284
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,440
month but you might not be making any

285
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,360
sort of debt to it

286
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,279
you might be paying the minimum payment

287
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,320
but you're not taking off that interest

288
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:50,000
which may be just as much as the

289
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,320
minimum payment that you're making so

290
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,760
it's really important to keep track of

291
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,959
all your debt so you know that you're

292
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,440
making a dent

293
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,720
and you're closer to that sort of

294
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,600
financial freedom

295
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,360
that you have from your debt i also like

296
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,000
tracking my assets because i like to

297
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,079
know

298
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,160
whether or not i'm saving enough and i

299
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:10,320
like to know if i'm making incremental

300
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,600
steps towards those goals that i have

301
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,959
such as saving

302
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,320
for moving out and just being able to

303
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,480
manage my money better

304
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,079
so it's been nice i've made a lot of

305
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:24,000
improvements like i said

306
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:26,160
about a year ago i wasn't overspender

307
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,680
but that's when i started budgeting and

308
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,399
taking control of my money

309
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,440
since the beginning of this calendar

310
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,560
year i've

311
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,200
improved a lot and i'm very proud of

312
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,079
myself

313
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,720
so the beginning of the calendar year i

314
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,120
had about

315
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,200
four thousand dollars in assets and now

316
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,839
i have nearly twelve thousand dollars in

317
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,760
assets

318
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,440
it may be a lot to some people may not

319
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,279
be a lot to others but

320
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,360
to me that's such a huge improvement

321
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,360
that's eight thousand dollars within

322
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,760
eight months so at that rate i'm saving

323
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,320
about 900 to a thousand dollars a month

324
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,200
which is

325
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,320
really nice also with my debt i made

326
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,560
tremendous

327
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,240
dents towards my credit card debt i

328
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,839
started off with nearly eight thousand

329
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,600
dollars in credit card debt and now i'm

330
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,600
almost down to five thousand

331
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,600
and i definitely made dents in my

332
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,079
student loan debts as well especially

333
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,560
since

334
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,640
they're doing a freeze on student loan

335
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,279
repayments for federal loans

336
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,640
i've been able to focus on the private

337
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,720
loans that i took out

338
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,399
for my schooling so my tesla and my

339
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,760
wristlet which are state-based

340
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,680
so connecticut and rhode island so i

341
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,880
like having the asset tracker in the

342
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,880
debt tracker because

343
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,519
i want to make sure that my assets are

344
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,480
going up while my debt is going down

345
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,800
and yeah that's basically how i set up

346
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,279
my budget and how i do my budget every

347
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,680
month

348
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:46,000
