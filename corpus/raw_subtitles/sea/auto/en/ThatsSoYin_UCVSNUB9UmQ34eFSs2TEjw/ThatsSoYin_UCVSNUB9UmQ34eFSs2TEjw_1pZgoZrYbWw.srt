1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,730
Germany epsilonc my Jasmine hey

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,290
everybody its Jasmine and today I have a

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,240
brand new video that I was actually

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:12,570
requested by one of my subscribers her

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,460
name Isabella and I was requested to do

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:20,220
a videos talking about me being

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:21,539
Cambodian this topic to me is something

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:25,470
I never thought I would actually address

9
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:28,830
because I never thought of I guess the

10
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:31,830
importance of actually vocalizing how I

11
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:34,890
feel about my own ethnicity about my own

12
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,480
culture and my roots but apparently to

13
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,610
some of you guys it is very interesting

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,809
because a lot of the comments that I do

15
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:44,730
get from other my Watchers viewers you

16
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:47,940
guys always tell me oh my god I've never

17
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:50,940
seen a Cambodian youtuber so to me that

18
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:53,780
is a huge compliment in its own so this

19
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,379
is why I feel confident in talking about

20
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:58,260
everything that I'm gonna talk about

21
00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:00,809
today hopefully we can learn a little

22
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,520
bit more about each other I do have some

23
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:04,140
questions that you guys personally asked

24
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,360
me but I'm gonna just start off with a

25
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,189
little bit of an FAQ type of thing

26
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,729
because you guys have pretty much the

27
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:14,729
same questions so am I born in America

28
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:17,130
or was I born in Cambodia I was born in

29
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:20,549
California my parents were born in

30
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:23,159
Cambodia and unfortunately they endure

31
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:24,299
the Khmer Rouge which is why they moved

32
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,470
here in the first place

33
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:30,869
now unfortunately within the war I lost

34
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,490
my two grandfather's and I just never

35
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:34,439
grew up with them I grew up with

36
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:37,740
everybody else in my family which I'm so

37
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:41,460
thankful for but I just wish I had a

38
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:43,439
grandfather figure to talk to but I know

39
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:48,060
he's somewhere out there looking down on

40
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:50,100
me blessing me being like I see you girl

41
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,770
I see you another question that I get

42
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,689
asked not only online but my friends

43
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:58,020
asked me to do I speak mine

44
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:59,969
unfortunately I can understand it very

45
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,549
well I could speak like the bare minimum

46
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:04,469
and as of right now as of like a week

47
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:06,270
ago I've actually been trying to teach

48
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:09,690
myself how to speak more and more come I

49
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:12,000
so right now where I'm at if you want to

50
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,379
see my progress I can count up to 20

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,739
pretty confidently

52
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:18,420
so there's that I am thinking about

53
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:20,579
doing a whole video like a makeup

54
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:24,870
tutorial where I speak cry but that is

55
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:27,599
so scary Chinese maybe later maybe later

56
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:30,209
have I ever visited Cambodia yes when I

57
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,879
was 16 right now I'm 20 keeps you guys

58
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:36,180
over now and it was nice it was really

59
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:38,609
cool I got to see where my parents grew

60
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,409
up I got to see from pain and I it was

61
00:02:38,609 --> 00:02:41,879
just it was just an eye-opening

62
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:44,700
experience overall and I would

63
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:46,500
definitely go back but you know it's

64
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,019
just it's all the way across the world

65
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:52,079
honey so whenever I have time when I

66
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:54,599
ever have money especially money then I

67
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:56,519
would be glad to go again so I'm just

68
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:58,620
gonna go on to my YouTube community tab

69
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:01,260
where you guys ask me some questions and

70
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:03,419
I got one from emerald on the moon that

71
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,819
says lol you're like the first one I've

72
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:07,620
ever seen on YouTube so it would be a

73
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:09,750
cool video she's talking about this one

74
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,579
but one question would be what do your

75
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:14,129
parents think about it kind of my

76
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:16,139
parents are always so not understanding

77
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:18,540
and strict but yours may not be so

78
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:21,689
beagle to know now when I told my

79
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:26,220
parents and I made YouTube videos their

80
00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:29,280
initial reaction I was like okay cool my

81
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,569
parents I feel like are strict to the

82
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,759
point where like I can't hang out with

83
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:34,949
people but then if it's like something

84
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:36,810
that I want to do on my own and that's

85
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:39,599
affecting just me personally I don't

86
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:41,579
think they really care for example I cut

87
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,310
my hair right I cut my bangs they don't

88
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:46,949
care I would dye my bangs blue in high

89
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:49,709
school they didn't care if I asked for a

90
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:51,900
sleepover they would say no but when I

91
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:53,669
told them I had a YouTube channel and

92
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,759
when they actually found out and they

93
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:58,560
found out that has a significant handful

94
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:59,879
of people who are watching then we were

95
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,939
really proud of me and they were like

96
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:05,909
wow you're really doing some you

97
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:07,919
know so it's really cool to see them

98
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:09,419
actually support what I like doing you

99
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:11,219
know being a makeup artist like a

100
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:14,440
freelance makeup artist and seeing them

101
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:16,720
support me it's very very reassuring

102
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:19,360
I never thought that I would have a

103
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,670
career or just something that I like

104
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:24,610
doing that they approve of because Asian

105
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:26,920
parents in general so strict I was

106
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:30,280
always the kid who had to get straight

107
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:34,000
A's and had to do my best in school so

108
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:37,630
just doing something that I thought was

109
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,670
out of the ordinary is kind of scary but

110
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:43,720
just knowing that they're okay with it

111
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:46,000
is a big breath of fresh air

112
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,040
Bianca Lee asked me what it's like to be

113
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,170
a Cambodian youtuber there isn't a very

114
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,970
large Asian beauty guru community so I

115
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:53,560
think starting out was hard in the sense

116
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:55,840
of not seeing this role in the community

117
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:59,170
I agree completely

118
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:01,630
I noticed it from a very young age even

119
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:05,230
where I live even in the community that

120
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:08,530
I live in I am pretty much always the

121
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:11,500
only Cambodian person and I think that

122
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:13,690
just being in a community in person

123
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,940
where there's not a lot of Cambodian

124
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:20,320
people it just put into perspective that

125
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:21,940
I want to represent Cambodians I don't

126
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,270
know why but I just want to represent

127
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:27,490
because we are so often overlooked

128
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:32,380
because we are such a small country and

129
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:35,830
it's just it's sad to see that we are

130
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:39,820
depicted as like either gangsters or

131
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:43,360
either really poor and I just want you

132
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:45,640
guys know like hey we don't have to fall

133
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,580
into those stereotypes like we can be

134
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:50,890
like somewhat successful and we can be

135
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:53,380
somebody with those stereotypes attached

136
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:56,410
to us but we don't have to fall into

137
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:58,750
them and another side note even before I

138
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:02,020
was fully into makeup and all that I

139
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:05,919
even noticed on those foundation charts

140
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:08,320
or even in magazines there were rarely

141
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:10,630
any Asian models and if there was an

142
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:13,120
asian model they were stark white

143
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:17,050
there were always like the palest asian

144
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:19,900
so to me I always felt like oh that

145
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:21,460
makes me really pale too but no I have a

146
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:24,430
medium skin tone

147
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:26,110
I'm an Asian girl color and I want to

148
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:27,910
see more of that represented whether

149
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:29,530
they are Cambodian whether whether they

150
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:31,900
are Thai whether they're allow or than

151
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:33,460
me and I don't care I want to see the

152
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:36,220
representation within the brands because

153
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:38,139
we're often always overlooked Rose like

154
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:40,210
the flower asked me do you speak

155
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:42,160
Cambodian and if you do can you give us

156
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:47,110
a little sample maybe say yes I speak

157
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:49,180
Cambodian oh I suck at when people tell

158
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:51,910
me to say a specific sentence because I

159
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:57,070
get put under pressure if I remember

160
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:58,960
correctly Jack you'll make my and

161
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:00,610
knowing my parents I know damn well they

162
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,250
taught me Cambodian before it English

163
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:05,410
but they started to talk a little bit

164
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:08,380
more English at home because they wanted

165
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:11,349
to learn English so that kind of halted

166
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:14,440
the expansion of my knowledge to speak

167
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:16,150
my but I can understand it saying Karen

168
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,310
asked me how is your diet mostly

169
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:21,550
Cambodian or American and what is my

170
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:25,360
favorite Cambodian meal my diet is

171
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:27,699
anything Asian anything Asian I love

172
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,259
Asian food whether it's Korean whether

173
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:31,870
it is Vietnamese whether it's Thai

174
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:35,110
whether it's Cambodian I love it all I'm

175
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:37,630
just such a huge foodie they're like oh

176
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:41,349
a junk food doesn't right it's so

177
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:43,810
filling it's so warm it's just so so

178
00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:46,630
much like home to me and it just makes

179
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:50,500
me feel so comforted so any Asian food

180
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:52,300
will do American food though I don't

181
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,219
really eat all that much American food

182
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:56,590
to be honest it makes me feel very

183
00:07:54,219 --> 00:07:59,289
bloated and very fat so I'd rather not

184
00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:00,610
you know and then she said what is my

185
00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:04,960
favorite Cambodian meal

186
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:08,710
I love salami - I love Salama - with

187
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:11,770
those little lotus roots goodbye you

188
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:14,770
good bye have a nice day like I would be

189
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:16,690
all up in there I would literally go in

190
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:21,009
and just take the limit lotus root

191
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:23,289
lettuce just take it take it girl yes my

192
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:27,789
uncle makes amazing Ben chow oh my god

193
00:08:23,289 --> 00:08:31,080
oh my god and obviously just your

194
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:31,080
typical 'kathy which is

195
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:36,540
you can't really go wrong with noodles

196
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:39,460
right so I asked you guys questions on

197
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:41,740
Instagram and you guys asked me Tania

198
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:44,860
Sam asked me why do you think there are

199
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:46,690
so few Cambodians anything more so she's

200
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:49,870
talking about the YouTube side of things

201
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:53,320
or like social media I think there's so

202
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:55,690
few because again we're not represented

203
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:58,330
and it kind of goes back to the first

204
00:08:55,690 --> 00:09:00,160
question that I had from Emerald it's

205
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:03,280
because a lot of Asian parents are

206
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,950
strict not a lot of parents are able to

207
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:08,350
be cool and she'll be like hey that's

208
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:10,570
the right way to go because you know

209
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:14,880
there there's a lot of pressure because

210
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:18,400
my parents and my auntie's and everyone

211
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:21,570
everybody who's older than me majored in

212
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:25,780
some type of science biology physiology

213
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:29,590
what it whatever and I'm like I'm like

214
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:32,620
the next one down you know and so I I

215
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:34,420
had a lot of pressure and I can just

216
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:37,600
probably tell you that it is the

217
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:40,840
pressure from Cambodian families because

218
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:44,410
again we are poor country and yes we're

219
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:48,400
kind of like up-and-coming buy more so

220
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:51,100
we are pretty poor and I think that when

221
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:53,830
you are a Cambodian parent you want your

222
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:56,830
child to succeed and you want them to

223
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:58,420
make a good choices so that they can

224
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:01,420
have a lot of money provide for the

225
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:03,280
family and I think that just in an

226
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:06,040
outsider's perspective people don't

227
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:10,390
think that Oh making YouTube videos can

228
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:12,520
get you by I mean granted like I don't

229
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:15,070
really get paid off YouTube like most

230
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:17,890
most of my money is like commission from

231
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:21,090
affiliate links but even yet I still

232
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:23,860
like doing it but I think just having

233
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:26,350
having the mindset of like oh maybe my

234
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:29,530
parents aren't going to appreciate this

235
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:31,060
or even accept this is something that

236
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:33,340
always kind of runs in the back of our

237
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:36,340
minds and I think that is why there is

238
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:37,630
so few Jaden knows where they asked me

239
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:40,900
what was your favorite thing about

240
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:42,380
Cambodia and do I see myself moving back

241
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:45,740
while I never move there

242
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:48,710
first place but I think my favorite

243
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:53,660
thing about Cambodia was some of the

244
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:55,100
food definitely wherever you go food is

245
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:58,100
sometimes hit or miss depending on like

246
00:10:55,100 --> 00:11:01,580
where you go but I remember I think it

247
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:04,340
was module kadhi and they there's this

248
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:08,690
restaurant there they had some fresh egg

249
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:12,680
noodles oh my god I had I dream about it

250
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:15,710
it was so good and it's just so fresh

251
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:18,710
like just everything about it like the

252
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:19,790
scenery and you know some of the people

253
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:22,190
there are really really nice obviously

254
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:25,430
my family was really nice to me but just

255
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:26,840
everything about it it just felt like

256
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:29,180
home to me

257
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:31,670
and I know it was really hot and I know

258
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:35,420
like the traffic there is crazy and

259
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:38,090
everything just like is it as I guess

260
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:41,120
civilized as the United States but I

261
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:43,340
just felt comfortable everything about

262
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,830
it I just felt really comfortable and I

263
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:48,350
had a great time and I do see myself

264
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,820
visiting again it's just something that

265
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:51,440
I cherish so much I mean it's my

266
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:54,020
motherland what do you expect I love it

267
00:11:51,440 --> 00:12:00,620
there Cham Li asked me has anyone

268
00:11:54,020 --> 00:12:04,850
assumed URIs girl everybody assumes my

269
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:07,670
race nobody ever ever in my life guess

270
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:11,090
that I was Cambodian I have never came

271
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:13,970
across anybody none of my friends ever

272
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:16,730
guessed I was Cambodian everybody in

273
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:19,490
this town that I live in thinks I'm

274
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:22,610
Filipino where I work people think I'm

275
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:28,730
Mexican they also think I'm Indian I

276
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:31,190
don't look Indian I mean I don't look I

277
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:33,620
don't even look Mexican and people think

278
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:36,860
I'm Chinese Japanese Korean people think

279
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:40,070
I'm Thai but like they think everything

280
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:42,740
but everything but Cambodian and it's

281
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:47,180
kind of crazy to me but also not crazy

282
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:50,450
because again we're just not represented

283
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:52,820
enough and that's kind of my mission my

284
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:54,710
mission in life is to represent my

285
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,900
fellow Cambodians you know

286
00:12:54,710 --> 00:13:00,230
and whether be in makeup or whether it

287
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:02,060
be within my business major I want to

288
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:03,980
make it known I want to I want to let

289
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:06,350
people know that we're out here Taryn

290
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:08,480
asked me what was it like growing up

291
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:14,170
Cambodian in America any difficulties

292
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:17,510
and racism growing up in America it

293
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:19,040
definitely is kind of an eye-opener even

294
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:21,560
though I haven't you know been in

295
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,210
Cambodia all that much it was definitely

296
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:25,310
an eye-opener because even at a young

297
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:27,770
age like I said I kind of noticed that

298
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:32,090
I'm unrepresented in a lot of

299
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:35,090
circumstances and I noticed that people

300
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:38,510
look down on a lot of Asian people and

301
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:40,910
it's not just Cambodians it's literally

302
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:43,880
a lot of Asian people and they think

303
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:46,670
that Oh weird that is becoming like

304
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:49,310
nurses or just really good at math and

305
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:53,600
we just hold this stereotype where I

306
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:56,240
work there is a lot of racism and I've

307
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,820
caught in so many insults throughout my

308
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,110
life you know even at a young age like

309
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:02,510
people will come up to me and they'll be

310
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:05,030
like hey are you from China straight up

311
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:06,770
to my face people people at work would

312
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:07,850
be like I don't understand what you're

313
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:11,210
saying I don't speak your ching-chong

314
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:15,230
language or they would say things out of

315
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:18,560
pocket and when I'm working they would

316
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:20,570
say like can you read this it says like

317
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,650
I don't know like I'll just hold up this

318
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:23,780
because it's right in front of me my

319
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:30,650
hourglass highlighter it would just be

320
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:35,600
like can you read this H oh you are etc

321
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:37,430
etc so I went hit so much racism

322
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,170
throughout my life people think I've

323
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:40,910
been competent and people think that I

324
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:43,040
don't know how to speak English people

325
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:44,960
think that I don't know how to do all

326
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:48,740
these things regarding English and it's

327
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:51,830
just frustrating it's frustrating and

328
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:55,250
you don't know how many times I just try

329
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:58,190
to keep my cool and to just say you know

330
00:14:55,250 --> 00:15:02,690
what they don't know me they don't know

331
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:05,750
where it came from and that to me racism

332
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:07,710
it's its own difficulty I just had a lot

333
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:09,990
of difficulties growing up

334
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:14,190
in general that don't pertain to being

335
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:17,399
Cambodian but that itself is a whole

336
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:18,899
nother video and I have just gone

337
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:23,220
through hell and back

338
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:25,890
basically so just thinking about like me

339
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:28,770
being bullied and like all the racial

340
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:31,920
slurs that I've endured it's a lot to

341
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:33,690
take in because but you never expect

342
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:37,260
like when you're 12 you never expect

343
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:40,529
people to come up to you and be like can

344
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:44,399
you read this because you're Asian it's

345
00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:46,230
it's hard it's hard growing up in that

346
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,060
environment and I still I still get that

347
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:52,680
today you know it's something that's

348
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:57,300
never ending so it still like strikes

349
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:58,470
like a really hard core and yeah I don't

350
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,839
even know if that even makes sense but

351
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:05,220
it just it just hits me hard it's hard

352
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:08,220
when people just continuously bully you

353
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:10,140
and you know just say all these mean

354
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:12,029
things and they know that they're doing

355
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:13,470
you you know you can't just you can't

356
00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:15,570
just say like the n-word

357
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:17,310
to an african-american person and just

358
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:19,140
be like oh yeah well like that's just

359
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:21,209
fine like no you know what you're doing

360
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:22,770
you know exactly what you're doing and

361
00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:24,360
you're doing it to hurt somebody and

362
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:26,490
you're doing it to perpetuate somebody

363
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:29,820
you're not doing it just because it's

364
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:31,260
cool by the way I'm sorry for crying I

365
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:33,600
had like a really rough day at work

366
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:36,740
today people were calling me names

367
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,900
anything that's why I'm so upset about

368
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:45,390
the whole like racism thing it's because

369
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:48,330
it's so fresh it's so it's so like on

370
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:53,250
the surface you know and I'm just I'm

371
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:56,930
still trying to get through it so if you

372
00:16:53,250 --> 00:17:00,150
ever think that calling people names or

373
00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:02,940
saying anything rude to somebody is okay

374
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:04,949
it's never okay but you know what at the

375
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,839
end of the day I love being Cambodian I

376
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:09,179
love being underrepresented because it

377
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:11,189
gives me the space and opportunity to

378
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:12,220
grow and just show people was right from

379
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:15,039
wrong and

380
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:17,199
I am so thankful that I have a platform

381
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:20,860
where I can share my thoughts genuinely

382
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:23,020
and openly to you guys because again

383
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:24,880
it's helping me achieve my dream and

384
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:27,400
it's helping me spread the word that

385
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,950
like hey you know there's there's more

386
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:32,740
races and Asia than just Chinese

387
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:35,890
Japanese and Korean there's so many more

388
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:38,919
countries out there and I just want

389
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:41,440
people to know that you know it's okay

390
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:43,450
to like ask if somebody is a certain

391
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,450
race but you know it's another thing to

392
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:49,090
just assume and to belittle them because

393
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:50,770
it's not okay it's not fine I want to

394
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:52,690
end this video on a positive note and

395
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:56,049
just talk about the good things about

396
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:57,970
being Cambodian and you know it is

397
00:17:56,049 --> 00:18:00,130
bittersweet that Cambodians are

398
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:02,740
underrepresented but it's also a

399
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:04,780
blessing because you know if your

400
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:08,110
Cambodian you're watching this we have

401
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:10,840
the power to make everybody aware that

402
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:13,000
you know we're here and we're here to

403
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:16,990
make an impact throughout my life I've

404
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:20,789
had many friends and I've added them a

405
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:25,210
lot about me and my culture through food

406
00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:28,360
just through me speaking the very teeny

407
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:32,380
bit of Cambodian that I know and it's

408
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:33,669
good to share cultures and I think that

409
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:36,210
is something I want you guys to take

410
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:40,600
away from this share your cultures and

411
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:42,690
be open about it be open taking the

412
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:46,450
information with a very open mind

413
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:49,450
everybody is unique in their own way and

414
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:53,440
we are not what stereotypes claim us to

415
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:55,600
be so I just want to end this video on a

416
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,370
