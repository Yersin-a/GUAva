It's Lyn. Time to get a little serious for a minute. This video is Part 1 of 5 that explores, reflects, and dives deeper into the topic of culture, race, ethnicity, heritage, and identity through my own lived experience as told through the lens of:  - a Filipina American - a cis woman of color - a feminist - a 1.5 generation immigrant - a 2nd culture kid - a child of a single mother - a third-generation teacher  After taking on the role of creating our school district's middle school ethnic studies curriculum, I realized that I should use my platform to share my own experiences as an Asian American immigrant that shaped who I am today. And while I will still continue to make silly videos on my little corner of the internet, I figured that now more than ever is the time to talk about how our own life's histories and herstories, and the impact of the people we encountered along the way, define(d/s) us.  ***  PS: Black Lives Matter!

Here are the questions I used in this tag video:  ❏ 1.) What ethnicity are you? ❏ 2.) Which generation are you?  ❏ 3.) What is your 1st experience where you felt that demarcation of being a minority/different? ❏ 4.) Were you always proud of your heritage, or was there a time when you rejected it? ❏ 5.) What are some stereotypes that you struggle with? ❏ 6.) Can you speak your language? ❏ 7.) How has being Filipino American affected your relationship with your parents? ❏ 8.) How do you feel about your heritage now? Do you identify with it? ❏ 9.) What is your favorite thing about being Filipino American/your heritage?  If you’d like to share your experience of growing up as an Asian American, please leave a comment below! I think it’s important to connect with one another. In the discussion of race in America, Asians don’t get much play, but the conversation is growing, thanks to various voices and increasing awareness of the rich gamut of the Asian American experience. I’m really excited to hear from you.   I forgot to mention one of my most favorite things about the Filipino culture: The national anthem! Have you heard it?? It’s one of the most upbeat, optimistic melodies I’ve ever heard. I remember marching around the ol’ Marquette Park house pounding my chest with my fist as I sang it. I’ve included a link to the anthem below.  I hope you enjoy hearing about just one of many Asian American experiences out there.
