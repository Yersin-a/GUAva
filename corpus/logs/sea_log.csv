1pZgoZrYbWw,ThatsSoYin,T,ThatsSoYin,UCVSNUB9UmQ34eFSs2TEjw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZgoZrYbWw,My Life as a Cambodian-American,"(edit: A lot of confusion on what I meant in the video, I'm talking about wanting to see more khmer representation in the BEAUTY COMMUNITY here on youtube. There is also a bit of confusion on what I meant as ‚ÄúCambodian-American‚Äù I am FULL Cambodian but I was born and raised in America which legally makes me American. Also, I know a lot of you have been commenting about how you want me to speak more khmer, but unfortunately my vocabulary is very limited and I can‚Äôt even speak a full sentence. Of course, I‚Äôll start speaking when I feel comfortable and when I practice more)  Thank you. All I can really say is thank you. You have all been so supportive of me ever since I started filming videos and I never knew that a hobby of mine could even impact a single person. To hear such encouraging and positive comments every day truly inspires me to be the best version of myself each day. I know I have a lot of bad days just like most of you, but I used to always live by the quote ""what doesn't kill you makes you stronger"" because we all endure hardships and battles that test our limits, but also is the driving force to help us grow.
