1,Cai Ping's Journal,,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeR4FxjvQMs,Growing Up Malaysian American 🇲🇾 🇺🇸! Struggles & Triumphs,"Hey guys!  Please ignore the helicopter noises; apparently there’s an invisible one in my flat (I thought that it would only be flying around in my room). After watching Jenn Im’s video on growing up Korean American, I thought I would make my own on what it was like growing up Malaysian American-and apparently I’m an endangered species! Also, correction* the Hokkien term “ 紅毛 (ang mo)” means “Caucasian/white person,” not “American.”  -Cai Ping G.
