Today i wanted to talk about what it is like being ADOPTED and Asian American AND because it is Asian Pacific American Heritage Month I thought it was fitting!   Being adopted and an Asian American are complex and there are difficult feelings that i have and are still processing. Not every adopted Asian woman feels the way i do. Everyone has their own experiences and ways of handling those emotions.   I‚Äôm not trying to say that you need to check all these boxes to validate your feelings. I wanted to film this to see if anyone else could relate and build up a platform for everyone to share their own unique experiences adopted or not.
