Today I’m here with a Full Face of Products I’m getting rid of. These are products that either didn’t work for me or I stopped using. Recently I got rid of a ton of makeup. I’m donating a bunch of it, but there are some products that aren’t in good enough shape to donate, so I decided to put them to use and create a look!
