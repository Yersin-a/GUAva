utterance_JennIm_1_101527_102459_0_25_1_182 things like this again
utterance_JennIm_1_102931_108747_0_25_6_066 i told her that i only wanted her to pack like lunchables and sandwiches just like normal american food so that i would fit in
utterance_JennIm_1_108947_114611_0_25_5_914 when i was younger there was a period where i was super proud to be korean uh it happened when i was around like
utterance_JennIm_1_114787_121803_0_25_7_266 nine years old my mom took me and my brother to korea for the entire summer and we stayed at my aunt's and it was_unc such an amazing experience because
utterance_JennIm_1_122123_124827_0_25_2_954 for once like i realized like everyone looked like me and i
utterance_JennIm_1_124979_125427_0_25_0_698 felt
utterance_JennIm_1_125579_126387_0_25_1_058 really
utterance_JennIm_1_126667_127419_0_25_1_002 just like
utterance_JennIm_1_127731_132659_0_25_5_178 i just felt like i connected with everybody and i remember always hanging out at this park
utterance_JennIm_1_132819_142035_0_25_9_466 where all the kids used to hang out and i made a lot of friends because everyone was so fascinated at the fact that i was uh american and so i would bring like chapter books that i'd packed
utterance_JennIm_1_142387_144107_0_25_1_97 and i'd be like yeo_cs chaeg_cs aljana_cs
utterance_JennIm_1_145507_155387_0_25_10_13 and everyone was like so impressed and it was just it was just a really great time for me uh and that's when i was really just like proud of my culture and when i brought that back to
utterance_JennIm_1_14560_15600_0_25_1_2905 and in the spirit of that
utterance_JennIm_1_155763_157259_0_25_1_746 america like that
utterance_JennIm_1_157759_158471_0_25_0_962 that pride
utterance_JennIm_1_15840_19169_0_25_3_5785 i thought that it would be very timely to do the asian american tag
utterance_JennIm_1_158639_159863_0_25_1_474 stayed there for a little bit
utterance_JennIm_1_160095_160743_0_25_0_898 until
utterance_JennIm_1_160903_162279_0_25_1_626 i went to middle school
utterance_JennIm_1_162583_171279_0_25_8_946 and middle school was when everything just kind of changed for me i feel like it was a lot of factors just hitting all when i was like 11 it was puberty
utterance_JennIm_1_171575_173527_0_25_2_202 it was the fact that i was like chubby
utterance_JennIm_1_173783_182079_0_25_8_546 and then the fact that like there weren't that many asians in my school_unc i remember there was a group of these boys that walked on the same route as me home
utterance_JennIm_1_182415_188903_0_25_6_738 and i remember hating when we would like cross paths because they would always_unc say something to me and they would say something so
utterance_JennIm_1_189375_197239_0_25_8_114 like racist they would say things like hey chink do_unc you wanna do my homework or hey you dropped your calculator and now
utterance_JennIm_1_19497_24817_0_25_5_5702 um i wanted to share with you guys my experience growing up asian american and my friend amy
utterance_JennIm_1_197559_198335_0_25_1_026 i wish
utterance_JennIm_1_198599_208307_0_25_9_958 that i had the strength to just clap back_unc at them because at the time i just didn't say anything i was so scared i was af i was genuinely afraid of my l for i was afraid for my life and
utterance_JennIm_1_208947_211219_0_25_2_522 i wish that i had the courage to just like
utterance_JennIm_1_211331_212387_0_25_1_306 stand up to them and be like
utterance_JennIm_1_212499_213211_0_25_0_962 hey yes
utterance_JennIm_1_213419_223155_0_25_9_986 i did drop my calculator thank you i'm really_unc really gonna need this when i'm just calculating all my_unc finances in the future uh but unfortunately uh i wasn't like that
utterance_JennIm_1_223395_227443_0_25_4_298 i think this also crossed at the same path when my parents made me go to
utterance_JennIm_1_227683_229431_0_25_1_998 korean school on saturday
utterance_JennIm_1_229695_237987_0_25_8_542 and i was so pissed that they were making me and my brother go to school a an extra day like we already had monday through friday and now they're adding like
utterance_JennIm_1_238291_241091_0_25_3_05 a whole new curriculum for saturday and
utterance_JennIm_1_241331_246979_0_25_5_898 like we also they also made us go to church every sunday so i felt like i had no days off like ugh so_unc
utterance_JennIm_1_247371_253339_0_25_6_218 so we had to go to korean school and there was this one instance with a teacher that just really stuck with me
utterance_JennIm_1_25145_33337_0_25_8_4422 gave this whole concept structure and made it very simple by creating questions and so i just wanna dive right into it so let's get started
utterance_JennIm_1_253987_263883_0_25_10_146 she was telling us that when people ask us what our ethnicity is we need to say that we are korean american the korean always has to be first and
utterance_JennIm_1_264027_272427_0_25_8_65 i remember being very unsettled by it because i felt like in my heart that i was american so i rose my hand and i told her my my piece and she said no
utterance_JennIm_1_272635_277763_0_25_5_378 you are always going to be korean you're korean american and
utterance_JennIm_1_278459_279411_0_25_1_202 i just said like
utterance_JennIm_1_279715_284667_0_25_5_202 why can't i just be american i was born here i speak the language i don't understand
utterance_JennIm_1_284859_285923_0_25_1_314 i just felt like this
utterance_JennIm_1_286059_290699_0_25_4_89 big distance between my culture and what i was brought into
utterance_JennIm_1_290971_297915_0_25_7_194 i associated being korean as a negative thing because number one the bullying sucked and number two i would see the way
utterance_JennIm_1_298163_300187_0_25_2_274 people would treat my parents like my parents
utterance_JennIm_1_300403_301771_0_25_1_618 didn't speak english very well
utterance_JennIm_1_301923_311867_0_25_10_194 i would just see the way people would treat my parents because of their accent people lose their temper people get frustrated people treat you like you're a you're like you're an idiot when you have an accent and
utterance_JennIm_1_313027_315367_0_25_2_59 it just really frustrated me and uh
utterance_JennIm_1_315535_323623_0_25_8_338 my mom is already kind of a shy timid person and i think when she was thrown into this world in america as like a foreign
utterance_JennIm_1_325595_327243_0_25_1_898 i think that just made her recluse even more
utterance_JennIm_1_327555_332155_0_25_4_85 one stereotype that i absolutely struggled with growing up was the model minority stereotype
utterance_JennIm_1_332451_338003_0_25_5_802 the fact that all asians are amazing at crunching numbers and they're just really great academically blah blah blah blah
utterance_JennIm_1_33481_37345_0_25_4_114 i am korean american i was born and raised in southern california
utterance_JennIm_1_338395_341619_0_25_3_474 um and i think from an outsider's perspective people might think wow like
utterance_JennIm_1_341723_343311_0_25_1_838 that's actually a really good stereotype
utterance_JennIm_1_343519_351671_0_25_8_402 like people just think you're really smart but it puts a lot of pressure on you especially when you are not academically smart like i growing up i tried my best to be a good student
utterance_JennIm_1_351951_357655_0_25_5_954 growing up i tried my best to be a good student like i would literally spend hours and hours
utterance_JennIm_1_357815_360707_0_25_3_142 doing my homework and all this stuff and it just wouldn't
utterance_JennIm_1_360883_364219_0_25_3_586 register to me like i was always like a b minus
utterance_JennIm_1_364387_365419_0_25_1_282 c student
utterance_JennIm_1_365531_365811_0_25_0_53 like
utterance_JennIm_1_365915_368027_0_25_2_362 one time i got a d and like
utterance_JennIm_1_368179_376251_0_25_8_322 in an asian household like that is unacceptable like my_unc b minuses were such disappointments to my parents and they would always compare me to like other kids
utterance_JennIm_1_37545_47521_0_25_10_226 so my parents immigrated from korea and they first moved to chile and that's where my mom had my brother uh but after my parents got their green card they were able to
utterance_JennIm_1_376403_383259_0_25_7_106 and because i wasn't the best student i felt this distance between my asian american peers that were very studious
utterance_JennIm_1_383491_385439_0_25_2_198 mm b so i just found like a new group
utterance_JennIm_1_385663_387263_0_25_1_85 friends like friends that i can connect with
utterance_JennIm_1_387543_389145_0_25_1_852 artistically and creatively
utterance_JennIm_1_389401_394994_0_25_5_843 and obviously like there was like asian americans there too but it was like whole mix and it was really cool like we would
utterance_JennIm_1_395322_403243_0_25_8_171 you know burn cds for each other we would go to shows we'd go thrifting and i felt really blessed that i was able to have my own community in high school
utterance_JennIm_1_403419_408851_0_25_5_682 yes i can speak korean i would probably say i speak the equivalent of like a seven year old
utterance_JennIm_1_409211_411903_0_25_2_942 maybe a six year old now like i know how
utterance_JennIm_1_412055_415103_0_25_3_298 get by i know how to you know ask for directions order food
utterance_JennIm_1_415351_415815_0_25_0_714 have like
utterance_JennIm_1_415967_418671_0_25_2_954 light conversation but anything with depth
utterance_JennIm_1_418847_420275_0_25_1_678 i'm just like ugh like
utterance_JennIm_1_420467_423395_0_25_3_178 i don't know when i watch the korean news i'm just kinda like
utterance_JennIm_1_424115_426439_0_25_2_574 i don't know what they're saying they have to talk a lot slower
utterance_JennIm_1_426575_434087_0_25_7_762 it was a lot better when i was living with my parents obviously like i speak conglish with my parents so i'll speak korean and then i'll just fill in
utterance_JennIm_1_434327_441351_0_25_7_274 english words where i don't know the korean words i just don't understand like where did all those years of korean school go like did i just bury them in a box like it's
utterance_JennIm_1_441567_442207_0_25_0_89 i don't know
utterance_JennIm_1_442439_452215_0_25_10_026 but i want to change this desperately and so i'm just gonna do like an open call now i am looking for a korean tutor if you are based in the los angeles area i would love
utterance_JennIm_1_452575_454799_0_25_2_474 dm me on my instagram it's imjennim
utterance_JennIm_1_455143_457135_0_25_2_242 uh i guess you just tell me your name
utterance_JennIm_1_457319_460379_0_25_3_31 uh your age what school you go to or if you did
utterance_JennIm_1_460971_466351_0_25_5_63 and just like what kind of program would you put me on for ya know my korean tutoring session
utterance_JennIm_1_466599_469535_0_25_3_186 being korean american absolutely affected my relationship_unc
utterance_JennIm_1_469687_474615_0_25_5_178 my parents there was a lot of frustration and anger
utterance_JennIm_1_474767_477159_0_25_2_642 because of all the miscommunication that would happen
utterance_JennIm_1_47625_53481_0_25_6_106 come to america and they had me and so i would categorize me and my brother as
utterance_JennIm_1_477985_484729_0_25_6_994 there were so many times where i would just try to talk to my parents but there are just words that i just didn't know and vice versa
utterance_JennIm_1_484921_485321_0_25_0_65 and
utterance_JennIm_1_485473_488915_0_25_3_692 we would just have yelling matches like i would scream at them being like why can't you
utterance_JennIm_1_489235_496547_0_25_7_562 fucking learn english and they would just say like why don't you know korean like you are korean and so it always felt like this battle and
utterance_JennIm_1_496843_503375_0_25_6_782 growing up my entire life i felt this huge disconnect from my brain and my mouth like i felt like
utterance_JennIm_1_503807_512595_0_25_9_038 i couldn't say exactly what i was feeling or i couldn't articulate and put into words so writing was a nightmare for me i hated writing because i would just look at the paper and be like
utterance_JennIm_1_512891_522308_0_25_9_667 i don't i just don't know what to say i don't know like maybe was it because i was juggling two languages like i dunno i mean but i just look at other people and see like you grew up with like four languages
utterance_JennIm_1_522644_524949_0_25_2_555 fine so i don't know maybe it's just like a personal thing but
utterance_JennIm_1_525165_531013_0_25_6_098 i've always had trouble communicating and so with my parents with that language barrier it was just like an extra level of
utterance_JennIm_1_531503_531787_0_25_0_534 just
utterance_JennIm_1_532003_532667_0_25_0_914 ugh just
utterance_JennIm_1_532819_534011_0_25_1_442 fogginess and i just
utterance_JennIm_1_534131_536203_0_25_2_322 i was just very angry growing up and
utterance_JennIm_1_53625_60369_0_25_6_994 first generation because like my parents didn't speak any english so we were truly the first generation to really grow up american here
utterance_JennIm_1_536355_540475_0_25_4_37 i feel really bad for my parents because when i was a teenager i was not
utterance_JennIm_1_540715_542475_0_25_2_01 i mean i was kind of a nightmare so
utterance_JennIm_1_542691_552303_0_25_9_862 so now i wanna chat about the power dynamics because i feel like that was kind of off with my parents because when we were at home obviously my parents were in charge so we'd listen to them
utterance_JennIm_1_552567_553979_0_25_1_662 but when we were out
utterance_JennIm_1_554179_554963_0_25_1_034 and about
utterance_JennIm_1_555363_561147_0_25_6_034 we would always be translating and speaking especially for my mom and it's because my mom
utterance_JennIm_1_561443_564131_0_25_2_938 is a very shy and fearful person and
utterance_JennIm_1_565099_569571_0_25_4_722 sh i don't know if she was always this way because i i didn't know her when she was younger but
utterance_JennIm_1_570043_571339_0_25_1_546 i think it's because of
utterance_JennIm_1_571947_574595_0_25_2_898 the judgment that people would give because
utterance_JennIm_1_575275_579203_0_25_4_178 something really traumatic happened to her while she was out here so
utterance_JennIm_1_580379_583795_0_25_3_666 so when i was so when i was in preschool um
utterance_JennIm_1_584115_587699_0_25_3_834 i remember my dad picked me up from school
utterance_JennIm_1_587987_588643_0_25_0_906 and
utterance_JennIm_1_589163_595995_0_25_7_082 i knew something was wrong because normally my mom picks me up from school so we go home and i go to my parents' room
utterance_JennIm_1_596171_598035_0_25_2_114 and i see
utterance_JennIm_1_598219_601203_0_25_3_234 my mom just lying on the bed with a towel on her face
utterance_JennIm_1_601331_602003_0_25_0_922 and so
utterance_JennIm_1_602979_606419_0_25_3_69 i asked my dad like is everything okay and he he says oh she's just napping
utterance_JennIm_1_607707_608947_0_25_1_49 we find out later that
utterance_JennIm_1_60909_65613_0_25_4_954 the first experience when i realized that i was different from the rest of the kids was
utterance_JennIm_1_610059_616427_0_25_6_618 someone had robbed the store my parents had a really small shop that sold women's clothes in el monte and
utterance_JennIm_1_617659_618907_0_25_1_498 someone had had a knife
utterance_JennIm_1_619795_625363_0_25_5_818 and he told her to give her the money in the register and my mom refused because
utterance_JennIm_1_626547_628547_0_25_2_25 that was all the money we had
utterance_JennIm_1_629387_629907_0_25_0_77 so
utterance_JennIm_1_630699_632731_0_25_2_282 she said no and he sliced her face
utterance_JennIm_1_633003_633483_0_25_0_73 and
utterance_JennIm_1_634275_635395_0_25_1_37 of course he took the money
utterance_JennIm_1_637507_638171_0_25_0_914 and
utterance_JennIm_1_638875_642627_0_25_4_002 she was a very fearful fearful person after that she never spoke
utterance_JennIm_1_643107_643587_0_25_0_73 and
utterance_JennIm_1_645131_648459_0_25_3_578 i think it took her a very long time to recover from that
utterance_JennIm_1_648779_651275_0_25_2_746 when she told me that story again when i was older
utterance_JennIm_1_652043_652675_0_25_0_882 it just
utterance_JennIm_1_653595_656931_0_25_3_586 it just lit a fire in me like i kn i
utterance_JennIm_1_657379_657891_0_25_0_762 because
utterance_JennIm_1_659347_660675_0_25_1_578 because i'd never want
utterance_JennIm_1_65949_70189_0_25_4_49 when i was in first or second grade uh my mom packed my
utterance_JennIm_1_660971_664459_0_25_3_738 my parents to be in a situation like that ever again
utterance_JennIm_1_664955_667923_0_25_3_218 and the reason why i'm telling this story is because i feel like
utterance_JennIm_1_669099_670515_0_25_1_666 first generation parents
utterance_JennIm_1_671419_672811_0_25_1_642 they have to do
utterance_JennIm_1_673123_676683_0_25_3_81 the shitty jobs they have to work in the dangerous locations
utterance_JennIm_1_676947_680723_0_25_4_026 the have to work at the salon the convenience stores
utterance_JennIm_1_681243_681755_0_25_0_762 and
utterance_JennIm_1_681915_688579_0_25_6_914 they do this because they want to give us a better life and so it makes me want to try so hard
utterance_JennIm_1_688883_692971_0_25_4_338 and to be able to provide for them and so that they never have to worry about that again
utterance_JennIm_1_693307_700339_0_25_7_282 every day i'm so grateful that they chose to move here to give me and my brother a better life to give all of us a better life and
utterance_JennIm_1_700699_704171_0_25_3_722 whenever i'm feeling unmotivated or i feel like
utterance_JennIm_1_70341_72309_0_25_2_218 favorite food which was kare_cs_unc rice_cs
utterance_JennIm_1_704515_705939_0_25_1_674 i just can't do it
utterance_JennIm_1_706691_713615_0_25_7_174 i think of that and it just snaps me right back up and it just fuels me to push harder
utterance_JennIm_1_713807_720143_0_25_6_586 i feel so proud to be korean american now and it definitely took some time
utterance_JennIm_1_720311_726823_0_25_6_762 i think it's because the older i got the more i just had to accept myself and i started to embrace my heritage when i was
utterance_JennIm_1_72565_73553_0_25_1_238 which is basically just
utterance_JennIm_1_727063_730631_0_25_3_818 probably like a senior in high school to a freshman in college
utterance_JennIm_1_73713_74290_0_25_0_827 curry
utterance_JennIm_1_74490_83802_0_25_9_562 with rice and it has vegetables and meat and it's so delicious and i remember being so excited to eat it for lunchtime and when i opened the tupperware i remember a kid looking at it and just
utterance_JennIm_1_83962_85107_0_25_1_395 being so disgusted
utterance_JennIm_1_85683_86149_0_25_0_716 and he
utterance_JennIm_1_86405_89837_0_25_3_682 he just called me out he was like jennifer packed poop for lunch
utterance_JennIm_1_90229_99149_0_25_9_17 and i remember being so mortified and so embarrassed and i just completely lost my appetite and i don't i didn't even eat that lunch and when i got home
utterance_JennIm_1_99413_101351_0_25_2_188 i told my mom that i never wanted her to pack
