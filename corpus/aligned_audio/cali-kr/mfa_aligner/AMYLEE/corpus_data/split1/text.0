utterance_AMYLEE_1_104187_110387_0_25_6_45 and it's kind of on the border of la and orange county and it's called cerritos and for those of you who are familiar
utterance_AMYLEE_1_110603_111615_0_25_1_262 with cerritos
utterance_AMYLEE_1_111927_121747_0_25_10_07 it is very much so like irvine it is predominantly asian lots of good asian food lots of boba spots um but it's just a lot of asian families and
utterance_AMYLEE_1_122451_123703_0_25_1_502 uh it's just a very
utterance_AMYLEE_1_123935_124943_0_25_1_258 asian place
utterance_AMYLEE_1_125127_131087_0_25_6_21 but the cities neighboring it like artesia bellflower norwalk are predominantly
utterance_AMYLEE_1_131295_133615_0_25_2_57 latin or hispanic communities
utterance_AMYLEE_1_133951_139759_0_25_6_058 and so i think growing up i never truly felt like a minority but the first time
utterance_AMYLEE_1_140079_146159_0_25_6_33 that i understood that i was different or i understand it there is a demarcation
utterance_AMYLEE_1_146343_147143_0_25_1_05 between
utterance_AMYLEE_1_147359_148003_0_25_0_894 you know
utterance_AMYLEE_1_1480_10873_0_25_9_643 see race is the most racist thing you can say being colorblind is being blind to the thousands of years of oppression so i'm sorry sister but i totally see race
utterance_AMYLEE_1_148155_157259_0_25_9_354 me and the latin kids or whatever was i remember in second grade i was probably eight years old and we were sitting on the classroom floor
utterance_AMYLEE_1_157411_164899_0_25_7_738 and there was a guy named bobby who was mexican i believe and he asked me straight up to my fai face
utterance_AMYLEE_1_165059_168651_0_25_3_842 he said amy why are your eyes so chinky
utterance_AMYLEE_1_169047_177631_0_25_8_834 and i was just like whatever you know he's just being mean and i kind of brushed it off but then then he proceeds to say that there's so chinky
utterance_AMYLEE_1_177807_182199_0_25_4_642 that i look horny and i was eight years old and i remember distinctly thinking
utterance_AMYLEE_1_187895_196551_0_25_8_906 i_unn look_unn like_unn a_unn unicorn_unn i was just so confused and i said what the heck is horny i was just like what do you mean and he was just like
utterance_AMYLEE_1_196655_197999_0_25_1_594 never mind he was like
utterance_AMYLEE_1_198247_199363_0_25_1_366 just he just
utterance_AMYLEE_1_199723_208307_0_25_8_834 just kind of left it at that but i remember he would say that to me a lot he would always bully me for my eyes and growing up i did experience quite a lot of bullying
utterance_AMYLEE_1_208411_215411_0_25_7_25 from a lot of the latin kids for my eyes but even for me that was my biggest aha moment that i was like oh wow
utterance_AMYLEE_1_21169_22011_0_25_1_0919 you guessed it
utterance_AMYLEE_1_215531_219487_0_25_4_206 uh my eyes do look different from them and i'm different from them
utterance_AMYLEE_1_219751_223289_0_25_3_788 and that is when that kind of all started as a concept
utterance_AMYLEE_1_223665_225609_0_25_2_194 i also really wanted to learn what horny was
utterance_AMYLEE_1_22411_28411_0_25_6_25 amy_unc and_unc today we are going to talk about growing up asian american and right now i'm just
utterance_AMYLEE_1_225945_233482_0_25_7_787 but i didn't find that out 'til like way later i feel like <lgh> what's crazy to me is that happen so long ago when we were in second grade
utterance_AMYLEE_1_233834_240755_0_25_7_171 and i remember exactly his full name which i will not say and what he looked like and where we were and exactly how i felt
utterance_AMYLEE_1_240915_241651_0_25_0_986 and
utterance_AMYLEE_1_241771_242675_0_25_1_154 it just it's like
utterance_AMYLEE_1_242883_248107_0_25_5_474 crystal clear in my memory even though everything else from second grade is really not that clear <lgh>
utterance_AMYLEE_1_252691_261119_0_25_8_678 so elementary school was pretty okay and i feel like i got bullied mainly for how chinky my eyes were and i can't really remember what race
utterance_AMYLEE_1_261447_269651_0_25_8_454 they were so i really can't tell if they were asian people also making fun of me because asian people have also made fun of me for my chinky eyes which is so bizarre but
utterance_AMYLEE_1_269867_273743_0_25_4_126 anyways uh so middle school is definitely when i felt uh
utterance_AMYLEE_1_273943_275160_0_25_1_467 there were a lot more
utterance_AMYLEE_1_275272_276633_0_25_1_6105 hispanic people or latin
utterance_AMYLEE_1_276857_281201_0_25_4_594 people and i would be bullied for being asian or for being too smart or
utterance_AMYLEE_1_281505_285657_0_25_4_4025 why i always got a's on tests or whatever kind of falling into that model minority myth
utterance_AMYLEE_1_28571_37251_0_25_8_93 finishing up my concealer because i already did my base and my brows so i can speed up the process a little bit but i wanted to make this a tag video just for fun
utterance_AMYLEE_1_286129_294315_0_25_8_436 um but high school is when i finally went to cerritos high school which is a school that was not on anywhere of the border of these
utterance_AMYLEE_1_294515_296775_0_25_2_51 neighboring cities and it was
utterance_AMYLEE_1_296943_301953_0_25_5_26 all asian kids i remember going to the first day of school and i was like whoa there's
utterance_AMYLEE_1_302105_307729_0_25_5_874 so many people here that look like me and i would come to school and it'd just be like a group of asian kids like smoking
utterance_AMYLEE_1_307921_311603_0_25_3_932 and listening to like fly like a g6 and it was just very
utterance_AMYLEE_1_311859_315267_0_25_3_658 it i just felt like i was like in a far east movement music video
utterance_AMYLEE_1_315787_320091_0_25_4_554 it just so many asian kids some who thought they were cool there were nerdy ones whereas
utterance_AMYLEE_1_320267_329539_0_25_9_522 in middle school you know asian kids were just like nerdy and uh one dimensional in that sense because we were surrounded with other minorities but in high school it was
utterance_AMYLEE_1_329667_339653_0_25_10_236 all asian people and we had you know asian nerds the cool asians like in mean girls and um the the asian jocks the entire football team was asian
utterance_AMYLEE_1_339893_342191_0_25_2_548 we literally had no diversity in this
utterance_AMYLEE_1_342367_345819_0_25_3_702 school and so i think that was when i realized like
utterance_AMYLEE_1_345931_354379_0_25_8_698 oh my gosh i'm surrounded by so many people like me and who i am as a person i think i've always been a very anti establishment
utterance_AMYLEE_1_354563_355987_0_25_1_674 and very
utterance_AMYLEE_1_356387_358541_0_25_2_404 i like to stray from the norm and i'm very
utterance_AMYLEE_1_358797_363329_0_25_4_782 i don't like conformity i don't like if everyone says to do this i'm always like why why why
utterance_AMYLEE_1_363689_369349_0_25_5_91 and so soon as i got into high school i noticed that a lot of like the cool asians with popular kids were
utterance_AMYLEE_1_369501_378101_0_25_8_85 really into like r and b and hip hop and they were amazing at dancing and choreography and our drill team or dance show team was like
utterance_AMYLEE_1_37523_44491_0_25_7_218 because i know a lot of my asian american content creator friends have expressed concern to me that they wanted to talk about this but
utterance_AMYLEE_1_378463_380559_0_25_2_346 so good they were always competing and
utterance_AMYLEE_1_380703_382691_0_25_2_238 i was just like okay that's what's cool
utterance_AMYLEE_1_383299_388235_0_25_5_186 but to me i didn't want to be that way and so i think
utterance_AMYLEE_1_388427_397243_0_25_9_066 i _unc in my high school it is very normal and cool to be asian because literally everyone is asian and that is the norm and so i think i started to really reject
utterance_AMYLEE_1_44763_46403_0_25_1_89 just didn't really know how to
utterance_AMYLEE_1_46731_47627_0_25_1_146 and
utterance_AMYLEE_1_47859_50991_0_25_3_382 secondly if you guys want to do it i would love for you
