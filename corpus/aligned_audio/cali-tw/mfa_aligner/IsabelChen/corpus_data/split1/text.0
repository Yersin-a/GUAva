utterance_IsabelChen_1_0_4008_0_25_4_2588 hi everyone it's me isabel it's been such a long time
utterance_IsabelChen_1_101080_102584_0_25_1_754 and i would also have temple
utterance_IsabelChen_1_102744_104336_0_25_1_842 and these were things that
utterance_IsabelChen_1_104560_107504_0_25_3_194 were usually happening during my weekends
utterance_IsabelChen_1_107632_108248_0_25_0_866 and
utterance_IsabelChen_1_10824_16472_0_25_5_898 finished and now i am back home in taiwan i just wanted to film this video because
utterance_IsabelChen_1_108504_110018_0_25_1_764 it was just kind of weird to connect
utterance_IsabelChen_1_110258_115954_0_25_5_946 other people and realize that they didn't have chinese school or they didn't have um temple to go to during the weekend
utterance_IsabelChen_1_116114_121010_0_25_5_146 that was when i kind of felt like i was different but i just didn't really know why i was just like oh maybe that's just
utterance_IsabelChen_1_121668_129780_0_25_8_362 my family likes to do this never really had that much thought about it what really made me realize how different i was is when my family moved to taiwan
utterance_IsabelChen_1_130068_131436_0_25_1_618 because of my dad's job
utterance_IsabelChen_1_131788_133012_0_25_1_474 during that time
utterance_IsabelChen_1_133148_138348_0_25_5_45 i was placed into an international school in taiwan ivsh
utterance_IsabelChen_1_138596_139996_0_25_1_65 i just started to notice
utterance_IsabelChen_1_140524_144572_0_25_4_298 the difference of like oh being asian our school was literally like
utterance_IsabelChen_1_144764_146256_0_25_1_742 a whole grade was like
utterance_IsabelChen_1_147672_150088_0_25_2_666 fifty seven people and
utterance_IsabelChen_1_150464_151952_0_25_1_738 literally all of them
utterance_IsabelChen_1_152056_153088_0_25_1_282 were asian
utterance_IsabelChen_1_153192_158320_0_25_5_378 there were only probably a few that were not even_unc in that huge group of
utterance_IsabelChen_1_158472_159488_0_25_1_266 people that i
utterance_IsabelChen_1_159688_160512_0_25_1_074 that were like
utterance_IsabelChen_1_160840_163348_0_25_2_758 the same ethnicity as me i felt
utterance_IsabelChen_1_163484_167492_0_25_4_258 different i realized like my experience in taiwan
utterance_IsabelChen_1_16728_25568_0_25_9_09 a few days ago or yesterday i was watching jenn im 's video of being korean american and this was a tag from amy her friend
utterance_IsabelChen_1_167604_170852_0_25_3_498 um would be so different from my friends back in america
utterance_IsabelChen_1_171196_175684_0_25_4_738 like their high school experiences or like all the movies that i would watch of like
utterance_IsabelChen_1_175788_177924_0_25_2_386 prom we did have prom but it's like
utterance_IsabelChen_1_178108_178476_0_25_0_618 these
utterance_IsabelChen_1_179008_181184_0_25_2_426 experiences were not going to be
utterance_IsabelChen_1_181448_183144_0_25_1_946 at like the same as
utterance_IsabelChen_1_183416_189152_0_25_5_986 it would be if i was back in america and that's when i started to realize the difference of it
utterance_IsabelChen_1_189608_191588_0_25_2_23 or like international school
utterance_IsabelChen_1_191708_192164_0_25_0_706 it's
utterance_IsabelChen_1_192284_194188_0_25_2_154 where academia
utterance_IsabelChen_1_194412_196508_0_25_2_346 is largely english based
utterance_IsabelChen_1_196764_197364_0_25_0_85 um
utterance_IsabelChen_1_197580_199048_0_25_1_718 but you will also have chinese
utterance_IsabelChen_1_199288_202018_0_25_2_98 class um you also have chinese social studies
utterance_IsabelChen_1_202250_209682_0_25_7_682 which that adds on to an extra two hours so when usually back in america i would end class at two forty seven i'd end class
utterance_IsabelChen_1_209898_211156_0_25_1_508 here at four ten
utterance_IsabelChen_1_211992_215680_0_25_3_938 so that was always something weird to adjust with and also like
utterance_IsabelChen_1_215960_224088_0_25_8_378 the culture was not entirely similar to being in america and like having the education there
utterance_IsabelChen_1_228208_230360_0_25_2_402 when i was back in um
utterance_IsabelChen_1_230776_232568_0_25_2_042 america i would be like
utterance_IsabelChen_1_233248_235648_0_25_2_65 in america i would be like super excited of being um
utterance_IsabelChen_1_236664_246472_0_25_10_058 going to taiwan because i was like this is the place where i love how crowded it i was always really happy to go to taiwan i would find my family like my relatives and my grandma she cooked amazing food there was only
utterance_IsabelChen_1_246632_251400_0_25_5_018 she cooked amazing food there was only once i went to back to taiwan i actually lived there
utterance_IsabelChen_1_251584_253464_0_25_2_13 like lived here permanently for like
utterance_IsabelChen_1_254208_255468_0_25_1_51 eight years um
utterance_IsabelChen_1_255700_258380_0_25_2_93 that's when i started to really like
utterance_IsabelChen_1_25760_27088_0_25_1_578 who um
utterance_IsabelChen_1_258556_266388_0_25_8_082 reject my culture cuz i felt like everything was so homogenized and there wasn't really much diversity not saying all asians are the same someone says that like
utterance_IsabelChen_1_267528_268796_0_25_1_518 but in terms of like
utterance_IsabelChen_1_268996_276614_0_25_7_868 our background was pretty much similar in my high school it was incredibly um competitive there would be days where i felt like i was living in a bubble because
utterance_IsabelChen_1_27552_35840_0_25_8_538 was doing this in terms of asians pacific american heritage month and i was watching some videos on buzzfeed which they also had
utterance_IsabelChen_1_276958_279640_0_25_2_932 everyone was kind of striving for the same things that
utterance_IsabelChen_1_279848_281584_0_25_1_986 it just started to become really like
utterance_IsabelChen_1_282896_285280_0_25_2_634 overall i really wanted to meet people that were
utterance_IsabelChen_1_285688_291616_0_25_6_178 different from me like they had different stories they had a different background as opposed to something so similar because
utterance_IsabelChen_1_292096_293664_0_25_1_818 i felt like that really just
utterance_IsabelChen_1_293792_300016_0_25_6_474 made me focus on like a really narrow mindset as opposed to have like a wider mindset
utterance_IsabelChen_1_300256_302240_0_25_2_234 i only started to really like
utterance_IsabelChen_1_302496_311440_0_25_9_194 appreciate it was when i came back from my first year uh no first semester from c of college i go to college in new york so
utterance_IsabelChen_1_311568_313352_0_25_2_034 new york and taiwan is literally like
utterance_IsabelChen_1_315240_322132_0_25_7_142 the globe it's just so far away there is still like some parts of taiwanese culture but it's
utterance_IsabelChen_1_322404_328372_0_25_6_218 pretty miniscule compared to coming back here really just allowed me to miss home and realize like
utterance_IsabelChen_1_329428_331900_0_25_2_722 there are some experiences that i have that
utterance_IsabelChen_1_332060_338580_0_25_6_77 no one is able to really comprehend and really truly understand i felt so grateful to have
utterance_IsabelChen_1_338716_344832_0_25_6_366 um i felt so grateful to be called the international student because it really allowed me to gain this like
utterance_IsabelChen_1_345248_350224_0_25_5_226 critical view point the way of how i saw my life back
utterance_IsabelChen_1_350488_352512_0_25_2_274 in taiwan and my life
utterance_IsabelChen_1_352936_354016_0_25_1_33 during college
utterance_IsabelChen_1_358248_363484_0_25_5_486 okay so some stereotypes that i managed to struggle with
utterance_IsabelChen_1_35992_39576_0_25_3_834 other people talking about their experiences being immigrants or also
utterance_IsabelChen_1_363604_365884_0_25_2_53 asian are smart asians are good at math
utterance_IsabelChen_1_365988_370264_0_25_4_526 there's so many others that i could keep on talking about but that would just take
utterance_IsabelChen_1_370664_380200_0_25_9_786 a really long time for this pressure like that was not really spoken but you could still feel asians should be doing something that's more practical something more science
utterance_IsabelChen_1_380352_390120_0_25_10_018 or like stem based i was never really the person who was good at that i would always struggle on the subjects that y we were expected asians were expected to be good at
utterance_IsabelChen_1_390224_392928_0_25_2_954 wanting to do performing arts that just really
utterance_IsabelChen_1_393096_394000_0_25_1_154 made me different
utterance_IsabelChen_1_394280_400272_0_25_6_242 a lot of people would really judge comments of like oh are you sure you really want to do performing arts because it's not
utterance_IsabelChen_1_39680_41552_0_25_2_122 like born in america
utterance_IsabelChen_1_400456_405264_0_25_5_058 like something that's biological i'm not born where i'm just naturally good at math
utterance_IsabelChen_1_405440_408800_0_25_3_61 and science i get so tired when people just say
utterance_IsabelChen_1_409312_418808_0_25_9_746 that it's such like it's something that's so natural it's not how much hard work is instilled in like the academic system in taiwan or like
utterance_IsabelChen_1_41856_48616_0_25_7_01 but having to face like some difficulties and also successes being asian so i thought i would share some of my stories
utterance_IsabelChen_1_419192_426800_0_25_7_858 the kind of culture and like ideals that your parents instill on to you that's like the stereotype that i really just struggled with
utterance_IsabelChen_1_430080_435824_0_25_5_994 growing up in this kind of taiwanese culture they essentially instilled what they were taught
utterance_IsabelChen_1_436160_437356_0_25_1_446 from their parents
utterance_IsabelChen_1_438172_440596_0_25_2_674 to put on to like
utterance_IsabelChen_1_440956_444276_0_25_3_57 me and my brother they had more of a traditional mindset
utterance_IsabelChen_1_4440_5688_0_25_1_498 my stomach just growled
utterance_IsabelChen_1_444388_448236_0_25_4_098 mindset it came to gender norms for example for being a female
utterance_IsabelChen_1_448596_452664_0_25_4_318 i was expected to be prim and proper not to be too loud like not focusing
utterance_IsabelChen_1_453696_460264_0_25_6_818 is it focusing okay yay_unc often it's like what's expected of a son and what's expected of a daughter
utterance_IsabelChen_1_460552_461784_0_25_1_482 and um
utterance_IsabelChen_1_462392_463208_0_25_1_066 yeah like
utterance_IsabelChen_1_463744_467744_0_25_4_25 the things that they have been taught at a young age differs from like
utterance_IsabelChen_1_468152_476324_0_25_8_422 the things that i've been taught in college i've taken like classes and woman and gender studies classes like those really challenged like the social norms and like
utterance_IsabelChen_1_476620_482244_0_25_5_874 gender norms like expectations that are given that was like a huge eye opener
utterance_IsabelChen_1_482364_486776_0_25_4_662 for things that i've always questioned but was never really able to put a firm
utterance_IsabelChen_1_487080_488764_0_25_1_934 like stance or belief in
utterance_IsabelChen_1_48792_50936_0_25_2_394 i am really passionate about it overall
utterance_IsabelChen_1_489132_491332_0_25_2_45 a lot of my views
utterance_IsabelChen_1_491508_496316_0_25_5_058 that c often or sometimes come in clash with my parents are because i take
utterance_IsabelChen_1_496996_500924_0_25_4_178 indoctrinations that they bring to me and i also take
utterance_IsabelChen_1_501068_509692_0_25_8_874 like my outside college experience analyzing what are the stances that i believe like what are the values that i hold true i feel like
utterance_IsabelChen_1_509852_511220_0_25_1_618 in western like
utterance_IsabelChen_1_511332_512052_0_25_0_97 culture
utterance_IsabelChen_1_512188_516758_0_25_4_82 they emphasize on individualism it's that certain sense of like finding your own self
utterance_IsabelChen_1_51280_53816_0_25_2_786 basically what amy did was she put a whole tag
utterance_IsabelChen_1_516918_523352_0_25_6_684 and that you're the one who's able to create your own destiny i don't know if that really is truly related but like it's somewhat
utterance_IsabelChen_1_526072_526384_0_25_0_562 yeah
utterance_IsabelChen_1_532308_536876_0_25_4_818 uh yes i am extremely proud to be taiwanese american
utterance_IsabelChen_1_537092_539956_0_25_3_114 uh i think both cultures taiwanese and
utterance_IsabelChen_1_540084_542376_0_25_2_542 being american like these really shaped
utterance_IsabelChen_1_54016_54728_0_25_0_962 few questions
utterance_IsabelChen_1_542936_550048_0_25_7_362 the person that i am there's this way where i can compare and contrast and even like fuse together differing viewpoints
utterance_IsabelChen_1_55000_60120_0_25_5_37 i just did her questions that she provided and just answered them back on my trusty dusty laptop
utterance_IsabelChen_1_550232_552320_0_25_2_338 i remember i was talking to my dad
utterance_IsabelChen_1_552424_554536_0_25_2_362 came back from my first semester of college
utterance_IsabelChen_1_554648_557536_0_25_3_138 realizing that being taiwanese is something that i'm really proud of
utterance_IsabelChen_1_557688_559368_0_25_1_93 and he said like
utterance_IsabelChen_1_559528_562032_0_25_2_754 yeah the thing is that you'll always be taiwanese
utterance_IsabelChen_1_562448_568160_0_25_5_962 not american like that's for sure i stopped him and i said the thing is that i don't believe that
utterance_IsabelChen_1_568600_570408_0_25_2_058 american means
utterance_IsabelChen_1_570792_572520_0_25_1_978 only one thing like being american is
utterance_IsabelChen_1_572704_573184_0_25_0_73 being white
utterance_IsabelChen_1_573296_574064_0_25_1_018 instead
utterance_IsabelChen_1_574416_581568_0_25_7_402 being american is being korean american being japanese american hi um latinx american
utterance_IsabelChen_1_582216_585648_0_25_3_682 african american and even immigrants make up what is american
utterance_IsabelChen_1_585760_586984_0_25_1_474 that's my definition
utterance_IsabelChen_1_587296_592160_0_25_5_114 yes you can be both you can be taiwanese you can be american there should be this
utterance_IsabelChen_1_592320_594368_0_25_2_298 part where american encapsulates
utterance_IsabelChen_1_594560_596536_0_25_2_226 taiwanese or like korean
utterance_IsabelChen_1_596728_599040_0_25_2_562 just people who come to the states
utterance_IsabelChen_1_599256_600800_0_25_1_794 and just want to be
utterance_IsabelChen_1_601304_609960_0_25_8_906 here i really identify with it it's kind of like gratitude that you have because there's so much more to you your your ethnicity is
utterance_IsabelChen_1_60432_61560_0_25_1_378 without further ado
utterance_IsabelChen_1_610368_613656_0_25_3_538 important but it's not something that solely defines you
utterance_IsabelChen_1_61752_63296_0_25_1_794 we'll just start with it um
utterance_IsabelChen_1_619224_629096_0_25_10_122 my favorite thing about being asian american is bringing forth a different perspective when i'm in the states or when i'm even in
utterance_IsabelChen_1_6200_10496_0_25_4_546 it's been a really long time since i filmed i'm so sorry it was my first year of college
utterance_IsabelChen_1_629376_631720_0_25_2_594 taiwan stereotypes_unc are still so
utterance_IsabelChen_1_631912_637360_0_25_5_698 prevalent in our society i can't th like tell you how many times i've like
utterance_IsabelChen_1_63512_64192_0_25_0_93 new look
utterance_IsabelChen_1_637704_643536_0_25_6_082 had so many microaggressions that were directed at me or like stereotypes that people would use are you kidding me
utterance_IsabelChen_1_643648_644176_0_25_0_778 i think
utterance_IsabelChen_1_64440_67408_0_25_3_218 hello um i hope you guys enjoy
utterance_IsabelChen_1_648936_649768_0_25_1_082 advocate
utterance_IsabelChen_1_650128_651584_0_25_1_706 against the stereotypes
utterance_IsabelChen_1_651728_656048_0_25_4_57 there wouldn't be this kind of ex like belief that oh i would just breathe in and take it
utterance_IsabelChen_1_656536_661224_0_25_4_938 i want people to understand that stereotypes are not the way to allow people to
utterance_IsabelChen_1_661680_666552_0_25_5_122 get together instead it just divides other people it really makes me uncomfortable when people just
utterance_IsabelChen_1_667072_667648_0_25_0_826 reduce
utterance_IsabelChen_1_667816_674064_0_25_6_498 my personality or who i am as a person to just something so simple and something so offensive
utterance_IsabelChen_1_674376_680688_0_25_6_562 um i think being taiwanese american really allows me to just understand that there's still so much to
utterance_IsabelChen_1_680976_685400_0_25_4_674 that needs to be done terms of bringing more representation when it comes to like
utterance_IsabelChen_1_685688_690176_0_25_4_738 tv shows or_unc movies because there are so many stereotypes that
utterance_IsabelChen_1_690752_692040_0_25_1_538 like you can see in film
utterance_IsabelChen_1_692168_700104_0_25_8_186 the great wall for example and assume that white people are the ones that are saving china you would never really understand or realize that there's
utterance_IsabelChen_1_69656_74928_0_25_5_522 so i'm taiwanese american and i am a second generation immigrant uh
utterance_IsabelChen_1_700304_701488_0_25_1_434 there's a certain kind of
utterance_IsabelChen_1_702104_711760_0_25_9_906 dignity something that's more_unc magnificent and the actual true story of something then an outsider's viewpoint of
utterance_IsabelChen_1_712200_714728_0_25_2_778 a country that's alien that's really just
utterance_IsabelChen_1_715336_717280_0_25_2_194 my favorite thing about being an asian american
